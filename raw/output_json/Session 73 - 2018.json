        "file_text": "Let me begin by congratulating Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, and in particular for being the fourth woman in the 73-year history of the United Nations to receive the high honour of being elevated to the position of President of the General Assembly.\nHowever, I would like to pause at this stage, because I came here with a speech that is impossible for me to deliver given the events that have happened in the past 24 hours in the world in which we live and that cannot be ignored. Those events include the transit of a tropical storm across my own country that we thought would have passed us by, only to have floods hit many of our communities overnight, the onslaught of that same storm on our sister country, Saint Lucia, an earthquake off the shores of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Dominica this morning, which did not affect land\n \nbut destabilized those islands, an earthquake and tsunami off Indonesia earlier today, and a typhoon that is about to deal a blow to the people of Japan. Those events are of great concern because the world in which we live is a very different world from the one we have known.\nI ask myself, what does all that matter? Last year the Prime Minister of Dominica stood at this rostrum within days of the passage of a hurricane so violent that to describe it as a category 5 hurricane would be to do injustice to what the people of Dominica were exposed to (see A/72/PV.19). The Assembly heard my colleague the Prime Minister of Antigua speak earlier of the fact that over $140 billion in damage has come to the Caribbean region as a result of those weather systems. I therefore ask the interpreters today to bear with me, because it is impossible to deliver a speech that is focused on anything else other than our reality in the Caribbean, our reality in the Pacific islands, our reality in the world in which we live.\nAs Heads of Government, we have asked the international community to address those issues, both in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and as we come to twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, against the background of climate change consisting of a warming of as much as 2\u00b0C. But two days ago, at the One Planet Summit, a graph was shown that has haunted me for the past 48 hours. That graph spoke to the fate of the world with respect to the tipping points for a warming of 3\u00b0 Celsius and under, for 3\u00b0 to 5\u00b0, and for over 5\u00b0. For a change of 3\u00b0 Celsius and under, for which we are now on  course because  of our inability to take decisive action, the Arctic, the Antarctic and Greenland, as well as the coral islands and their people \u2014 the people of the region from which I come \u2014 are at terrible risk.\nFor us it is about saving lives; for others it is about saving profits. We have reached the stage where we ask the global community to recognize that what is at stake is simply not an academic debate. It is simply not a question of the profits of multinational corporations. But the evidence is clear and decisive that it is the lives and the livelihoods of our people that are at stake.\nI ask the Assembly, how can we just listen to speech after speech after speech about the problem? How many more speeches must we listen to before we realize that agreements are necessary to fund the effort\nto address climate change, as well as agreements to cap our emissions. We cannot accept a change of 2\u00b0C, because a change of 2\u00b0 means a rising sea level of 1.5 to 2 metres for our islands. For islands like ours much of our economy is based on our coasts. The international community must begin to understand what it will be like for us by the end of the century. Matters pertaining to migration and security will become ever more pressing in this world if we do not put a stop our growing emissions.\nI have therefore come here today not to talk about a wide range of issues. There are those who would wish that I would speak on denuclearization, and our voice will be heard on that issue, as the statement that I originally planned to deliver will be distributed. There are those who would  wish  that  we  should  also speak on a matter that is gravely affecting our community \u2014 chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \u2014 and we shall speak on that continuously in other forums, because it is affecting one in every four of our citizens. There are those who  would want me  to speak also about the graduation of middle-income countries to a status where we have lost access to finance, which, ironically, affects our ability to adapt our environments, economies and societies to confront climate change and its vagaries.\nBut when we make those arguments in forum after forum after forum, we are met with stern faces and a determination that our per capita income \u2014 as if that were the real factor in how people eat and how people move and how people sleep \u2014 should now  preclude  us from being able to have access to the very funding needed to protect our people from the worst ravages of the storms, earthquakes and fires that beset us. I ask this global community to pause and reflect. As we learned when we went to San Francisco two weeks ago for the Global Climate Action Summit, time is truly running out on us.\nWe will make the decisions that we have to make on a national level. We have committed to banning single-use plastics and styrofoam starting in April 2019. We will try to become a fossil-fuel-free country by 2030. But what does that mean against the backdrop of a world that is not prepared to put the funding in place to be able to stop the worst aspects of climate change? What does that mean to people who have to rely on a Green Climate Fund because their per capita income or their capacity to provide for their people is simply not there? Is this a sterile environment, or is this\n \nan environment that recognizes that, mighty or small, we in this world must protect each other?\nAs a small State we are accustomed to being treated sometimes as if we did not exist. That is what happened when de-risking from correspondent banking became the order of the day in the past few years, as   if it were possible to cut a region off from access to trade and expect it to be able to pay for goods and services, despite the fact that its banks can no longer have relationships with banks outside its borders. The only time people were treated like that before was in the previous century when we separated persons out of the general population as lepers. But the countries that come here to the United Nations as sovereign countries begin to ask themselves, do we now live in a world where the mighty manoeuvre to make the majority into minions? Or is this still a world that was promised to us in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, upholding respect for the dignity of all?\nWe as small States need a corridor of stability. We simply do not have the buffer to be able to withstand the shocks of international economic and financial crises. We do not have the ability to withstand climate shock, or the capacity to come to grips with the pervasive nature of chronic NCDs. Those are the things that destabilize us. But to that is added the removal of the insurance policy of the United Nations \u2014 an Organization that may not be well known or popular by  name among  our citizens, but an organization nevertheless without which we could not have made the  gains  that  we  have made with respect to the reduction in childhood mortality, with respect to the billions of people being lifted out of abject poverty, or with respect to us being able as a world to create zones of peace, as we hope our Caribbean region will always be, not like in previous centuries, when it became a theatre of battle.\nThe United Nations matters to us. It protects the small, it constrains the large and it gives us the ability to be able to plan for the future in that corridor of stability. When multilateralism is taken away from us, what are we left with and who is left to protect us? Who will hear us, and on whose platform will we be able to call not just upon the Governments of the world but also on the people of the world? For what is clearly required now is a behavioural change so that we can constrain the madness that is taking place and restore global governance so as to  counter  the  unilateral  actions  of many.\nWe ask ourselves, how do our citizens feel  that  we must come here year after year and make the call year after year as we do? From Barbados we come here and we speak about the embargo against the people of Cuba \u2014 year after year \u2014 almost as if it were pro forma. But it is not pro forma for the people in La Habana or Santiago. We speak about territorial disputes but we see no major gains with respect to them. That may be tolerable for certain things, but it cannot be acceptable for the issue of climate change. That is a matter of life and death for us.\nWe stand here conscious that, in many respects, today\u2019s  world  looks  like  the  world  of  100  years ago \u2014 the world that my grandparents inhabited, with its concentration of wealth, inequity and disposition  to nationalism and xenophobia. And what did  that lead to 100 years ago? It led to two world wars and an atomic bomb. I repeat, it led to two world wars and an atomic bomb. There are some who might say that it was the occurrence of those wars that gave rise to the United Nations, because the circumstances at that time forced nations to agree when they might otherwise not have agreed.\nI truly pray that this world does not need to see greater calamity or greater loss of life to understand what is required of each and every one of us, as we stand in trust on behalf of the people whom we represent and who demand decisive action. We are not expected to achieve it all. The Talmud says that we are not even expected to complete the task, but we are not at liberty to resile from it. We in the Caribbean and in the Pacific need the world to look again at a commitment to a change of no more than 1.5\u00b0 C, because 2\u00b0 would be calamitous. We need dedicated financing for development in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Plan, which speaks about small island developing States. We need the world to recognize that the graph that showed the tipping points must not serve to reinforce our greatest fear, namely, that the world believes that we are dispensable. For that was how we felt a century and more ago.\nI raise the question in the same way that I understand that our principles must remain constant. Fifty-two years ago, the first Prime Minister of Barbados stood at this rostrum and articulated a principle that binds  us still today, namely, that we in Barbados shall, in  the conduct of our international relations, forever be friends of all and satellites of none (see A/PV.1487). That is absolutely still our principle, but the world in which we live is no longer the world that existed when\n \nhe delivered those comments. The baton has been passed from leader to leader, but it is time now for us in this Hall and in my country to recognize that that baton must be held firmly, because the storms, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and fires threaten to take the baton from us. I pray that the United Nations recognizes that the year 2020 is but 15 months away and that there will be a point of no return.\nThis is not a science-fiction movie. This is not a cartoon. And if I ever thought that it was a fantasy, what transpired in the last 24 hours across the different poles of the world has reminded me that it is not. I leave here to cut short my trip so that I can go home to my country. Some may say that, in spite of the flooding, we were lucky that tropical storm Kirk did not do greater damage. Two weeks ago in San Francisco, it was Isaac. I say simply that we cannot plan our affairs, or those of our people, on the basis of luck. It must be on the basis of policy and decisive action, but above all else on the basis of caring and empathy. I ask the world to pause \u2014 pause \u2014 and let us get this one right, because it is not about Governments anymore. It is about people.\n"

        "file_text": "On my own behalf and on behalf of my country, India, I should like to begin by congratulating you, Madam President, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. As a woman, I feel doubly proud that this honour has been bestowed on you. I also recall, with equal pride, that the first woman to occupy this eminent position was an Indian \u2014 Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit \u2014 in 1953, at the General Assembly at its eight session. I also thank former President Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for successfully presiding over the seventy-second session of the General Assembly.\n \nWe  received the   tragic   news   this   morning  of a tsunami and an earthquake, which occurred simultaneously. From this rostrum, on behalf of India, I wish to convey our deep condolences to the Government and the people of Indonesia. I would also like to assure them that India will cooperate in helping them during this trying time.\nThe United Nations is the world\u2019s principal multilateral organization, where nations  seek  balm for the wounds of history and a platform for solutions and where less developed nations sit with their more fortunate brethren to formulate plans that can correct skewed economic imbalances. In 2015, we established 2030 as a critically important horizon for 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A common refrain since 2015 has been that we will reach that horizon only if India finds its way to that destination; otherwise, we will fail.\nI assure the General Assembly through you, Madam President, that India will not let us fail. We are totally committed to achieving those objectives for our own people. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has initiated an unprecedented economic and social transformation that will help our country achieve its SDG benchmarks well before the deadline. I will provide an overview to illustrate the world\u2019s largest-scale exercise in poverty elimination and social transformation.\nThrough the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, the world\u2019s largest financial inclusion scheme, more than 320 million Indians who had previously never seen the inside of a bank now have bank accounts.  The programme has enabled the poor to receive direct benefit transfers from the Government\u2019s welfare programmes into their personal accounts, thereby stopping waste and corruption within the system. Similarly, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the world\u2019s largest health insurance programme, was launched by Prime Minister Modi a few days ago, on 23 September. That revolutionary scheme will benefit 500 million Indians, who will receive insurance coverage of 500,000 rupees per family annually. We have a prayer in India \u2014 Sarve Santu Niramaya \u2014 which means \u201cMay all be free from illness\u201d. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana, or National Health Protection Scheme, is the answer to that prayer.\nSimilarly, we have launched the largest-scale housing programme in the world aimed at ensuring that everyone  has a  roof  over  their head.  Under  the\nprogramme, we have set for ourselves a target of  nearly 21  million homes by  2022. So  far, more than  5 million homes for the poor have already been built. Two extremely effective programmes have also been initiated to increase the skill levels of those waiting to be employed through the National Skill Development Corporation and the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) programme, which seeks to turn the poor into entrepreneurs. I stress that more than 140 million Indians have taken out MUDRA loans. The most significant aspect of the MUDRA scheme is the fact that 76 per cent of its beneficiaries are women. At the heart of Prime Minister Modi\u2019s transformative vision is a radical idea, which is that uplifting any nation is best achieved through the comprehensive empowerment of women. All the programmes that I have just mentioned have the welfare of women at their core. Last year, I spoke about the Ujjwala programme (see A/72/PV.19), through which, I am happy to report,\n50 million free liquid-gas connections have been provided so far.\nAnother such initiative is the maternity benefit programme, in which women in India are provided with 26 weeks of paid leave to care for their newborns. As a woman, Madam President, you will understand better than most how vitally important that programme is for every mother. Some developed nations with huge economies do not provide more than six weeks\u2019 paid leave, thereby leading to a continuing struggle for more time off. In India, we have implemented what women across the world need, namely, 26 weeks of paid maternity leave.\nIn 2022, free India will be 75 years old. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to build a New India by then. What kind of India will that be? That India will be a clean, healthy, prosperous, secure, educated, developed, energized and strong India. That is our horizon for India in 2022, and we will reach it, as we are sparing no effort to meet that goal.\nThe greatest challenges of our era are the existential threats of climate change and terrorism. Underdeveloped and developing nations are the most affected victims of climate change. They have neither the capacity nor the resources to meet that crisis. The countries that have exploited nature for their short-term needs cannot abdicate their responsibilities in that matter. If we wish to save the world from the adverse effects of climate change, the developed nations must lift up the deprived with financial and technical resources. The principle\n \nof common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities was reiterated in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Prime Minister Modi, together with the Prime Minister of France, launched the International Solar Alliance. Sixty-eight nations have become members of the Alliance so far. In March, India and France chaired the founding conference of the Alliance, in which 120 countries participated. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Prime Minister Modi has been acknowledged as a champion in that area. He is also working towards realizing the principle of one sun, one grid, since he believes that, as there is only one sun, there should also be a single universal grid.  If that goal is achieved, we will be witness to a major revolution in the energy sector, which will represent a major milestone in combating all phenomena related to climate change.\nI mentioned terrorism as the second existential threat to humankind. We imagined that the advent of the twenty-first century would see an age of common good characterized by cooperation but, here in New York, the horrific tragedy of 11 September and, in Mumbai, the catastrophe of 26 November became nightmares that shattered our dreams. The demon of terrorism now stalks the world at a faster pace in some places, and at a slower one in others, but it is life-threatening everywhere. In our case, terrorism is bred not in some faraway land but across our border to the west. Our neighbour\u2019s expertise is not restricted to serving as a spawning ground for terrorism; our neighbour is also an expert in trying to mask malevolence with verbal duplicity. The most startling evidence of that duplicity was the fact that Osama Bin Laden, the architect and ideologue  of  11  September,  was  given  safe  haven in Pakistan.\nAmerica  had  declared  Osama  Bin   Laden   to be its most dangerous enemy and had launched an exhaustive, worldwide search to bring him to justice. What America could perhaps not comprehend was that Osama would find sanctuary in a country that claimed to be America\u2019s friend and ally, namely, Pakistan. Eventually, America\u2019s intelligence services discovered the truth of that hypocrisy, and its special forces delivered justice. But Pakistan continued to behave as if nothing had happened. Pakistan\u2019s commitment to terrorism as an instrument of official policy has not abated one bit, nor has its practice of hypocrisy. The killers of 11 September met their fate but the mastermind of 26 November, Hafiz Saeed, continues to roam the\nstreets of Pakistan with impunity. What is heartening is that the world is no longer ready to believe Islamabad. The Financial Action Task Force, for instance, has put Pakistan on notice with regard to the funding of terror.\nWe have been accused of sabotaging the process for talks with Pakistan. That is a complete lie. We believe that talks are the only rational means by which to settle even the most complex disputes. Accordingly, talks with Pakistan have been initiated many times. When they failed, it was only because of Pakistan\u2019s behaviour. There have been many Governments of numerous parties in India. Every Government has tried the peace option. By inviting the Heads of State of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to his swearing-in ceremony, Prime Minister Modi began his attempt for dialogue on his very first day in office. On 9 December 2016, I personally went to Islamabad and proposed a comprehensive bilateral dialogue. But soon afterwards, on 2 January, Pakistan-sponsored terrorists attacked our air force base in Pathankot. It is clear that we could not pursue talks in the middle of terrorist bloodshed. Even now, after the new Government in Pakistan came to power, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, wrote to Prime Minister Modi suggesting a meeting between our Foreign Ministers in New York. We even accepted the proposal but, within hours of our acceptance, news came that terrorists had killed three of our security personnel. Does that indicate a desire for dialogue? Could such a dialogue ever take place?\nTime and again, Pakistan has accused India of human rights violations. Who is a greater transgressor of human rights than a terrorist? Those who take innocent lives in pursuit of war by other means are defenders of inhuman behaviour, not of human rights. Pakistan glorifies killers. It refuses to see the blood of innocent victims. It has become something of a habit for Pakistan to throw the dust of deceit and deception up against India in order to provide some thin cover for its own guilt.\nThe United Nations has seen that before. Last year, using her right of reply, the representative of Pakistan displayed some photographs as proof of alleged human rights violations by India (see A/72/PV.22). The photographs turned out to be from another country. Similar false accusations have become part of its standard rhetoric.\nEach year, for the past five years, India has been arguing from this rostrum that lists are not enough if we\n \nwant to check terrorists and their protectors. We need to bring them to accountability through international law. In 1996, India submitted a document with a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism at the United Nations. That draft remains a draft today only because we cannot agree on a common language. On the one hand, we want to fight terrorism; on the other, we cannot define it.\nThat has allowed terrorists with a price on their head to be celebrated in Pakistan as \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d. Their cruelty and barbarism are being advertised as heroism. The country of Pakistan prints postage stamps glorifying such terrorists. How long can we sit quietly and listen to such claims? If we do not act now, we will have to deal with that demon later on, when it sets fire to the entire world. Once again, I appeal to this body to come to an agreement on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism and to adopt it as one of the necessary measures in a long-running war.\nI would now like to make some remarks regarding the United Nations. I began by highlighting its unique and positive role, but I must add that, step by slow  step, the importance, influence, respect for and value of this institution are beginning to ebb. It is time to wonder whether we are wandering towards the fate of the League of Nations, which came to an end because it did not adopt the changes that were needed. It was unwilling to accept the need for reforms; we must not make that mistake. The United Nations must accept that it needs fundamental reform. Those reforms cannot be simply cosmetic; we need to change the institution\u2019s head and heart in order to make both compatible with the contemporary reality.\nReform must begin today; tomorrow could be too late. Are all of the challenges that confronted the United Nations at its founding still relevant today? I feel that, in the Security Council, now is the time to start making much-needed changes.\nA subject that is often debated is multilateralism. The challenges we face are causing tensions in many countries. I should like to state that India believes that the world is one global family. The United Nations should therefore work as a family. How does a family work? It is shaped by love, not trade; it is nurtured by compassion, not jealousy; it functions by compromising, not by fighting. That is why the United Nations must be based on the principles of the family. It cannot be\nrun using \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d; this forum needs \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cours\u201d. Only then will it be sustainable.\nIndia does not believe that only certain countries should be allowed to fulfil their goal or that we should take decisions on behalf of other countries that are not beneficial to them. We should take every country\u2019s goals into account.\nThis year, India will celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s birth. Mahatma\u2019s favourite devotional hymn was \u201cVaishnav Jan To Tene Kahiye\u201d or \u201cCall those people Vaishnavas who feel the pain of others\u201d. Its essence is that he who understands the pain of another and absorbs it as his own is a good human being. He who sees that pain and helps without becoming arrogant is a good human being.\nWe have to make the Assembly a platform for understanding, assistance and true justice.  We  have to understand the pain of other nations and work with developed nations to ease and eliminate their pain. Arrogance has no place in our scheme of things; arrogance is counter-productive and self-defeating.  Let us work for the benefit of the less fortunate and towards a world that is free from terrorism, tension and violence. That is the universe we envisage.\nIt is with that wish in mind that I end with a Sanskrit shloka or song: May all experience well-being; may all experience peace; may all move towards perfection; may all enjoy prosperity; may all achieve serenity.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate the President on her election to lead this session of the General Assembly. I am sure that her work will attest to the pertinence of women\u2019s leadership.\nIt is an honour to return to the General Assembly to share our vision for the stage we are currently going through in Argentina and to ratify our commitment to making our country a protagonist that is fully integrated into the world. Our country is undergoing a period of profound change. We are determined to experience it with humility, while accepting the difficulties we face, and in our belief that we are making the right efforts. I know that the efforts required are great, and I want to thank every Argentine for that. We knew it would not be easy, because we are making changes without taking shortcuts or compromising our future. We are building a consensus for equitable and sustainable development. Two years ago, I shared here for the first time my view of Argentina as a reliable partner of the international community and a good-faith mediator of regional and\ninternational politics (see A/71/PV.8). Today I would like to renew that vision.\nSince I took office as President, we have been committed to an intelligent integration into the world, based on the value of our region, Latin America and the Caribbean. We are a zone of peace, with young populations full of talent and vitality and with abundant resources and natural reserves. We are working for greater integration among ourselves and with the rest of the world. That is evidenced by the willingness for dialogue and cooperation between the  countries  of the South American Common Market and the Pacific Alliance. We seek to have a positive impact on the world order of the twenty-first century. From the South, we take an optimistic view that ponders the opportunities and challenges of globalization. Intelligent integration is also part of our contribution to building a region and a world order that are stable and inclusive and that respect our values of peace, democracy and human rights.\nI would therefore like to take a moment once  again to express our concern regarding the human rights situation in Venezuela. Given its seriousness, Argentina wants to refer the situation of the Venezuelan dictatorship\u2019s crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court. I call on Venezuela to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis so that we can use international cooperation to address the health and food deprivation of displaced persons. We are part of a broad regional response that seeks to mitigate the difficulties of millions of Venezuelans in the wake of their exodus from their country by taking them in and integrating them into society. Argentina has already received 130,000 Venezuelans.\nFor decades we have convened here to safeguard international peace and security. However, we live  in a world that is not immune to serious threats such as organized crime, cybercrime and terrorism, which require cooperative responses if they are to be dealt with. In recent years, with political will and greater cooperation with our partners in the region and the world, we have managed to increase the quantity of drugs seized, dismantle criminal drug-trafficking  networks, catch more national and international fugitives and reduce homicides related to drug trafficking throughout our country. At the same time, we continue to seek the necessary consensus to design a complementary judicial authority at the regional level and thereby combat organized crime collectively.\n \nArgentina condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We suffered directly from two very serious terrorist attacks, in 1992 and 1994, which claimed the lives of 107 people and left hundreds wounded. Our country will not cease its efforts to bring all those involved in the attacks before Argentine courts so that they can be tried and ultimately sentenced. In that regard, considering that next year will mark 25 years since the attack on the Argentina Israeli Mutual Association, I should like once again to ask the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with the Argentine judicial authorities to advance investigations into the most brutal terrorist attack we have ever experienced on our territory. We call on countries that are friendly to Argentina to assist us by not harbouring under diplomatic immunity any of the accused for whom international arrest warrants and INTERPOL red notices have been issued. Here I would also like to remember the five Argentines who were killed on 31 October 2017 in this city. My heart is with the families of the victims, as well as all victims of barbaric acts of terrorism around the world.\nArgentina maintains a strategic vision for the South Atlantic, where we seek to peacefully develop an active policy on resources, the environment and science, which includes the question of the Malvinas. I should like to reaffirm once again before the Assembly the legitimate and imprescriptible sovereign rights of Argentina over the Malvinas, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. I should also like to reaffirm my Government\u2019s commitment to this new phase in relations with the United Kingdom, based on building mutual trust and a broad and positive dialogue.\nArgentina is a country with a democratic and multilateral identity. Multilateralism is  fundamental to highlighting our national interests and seeking consensus. We maintain our firm commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we established as pillars of our Government\u2019s policy on the eradication of poverty, combating climate change and achieving gender equality.\nArgentina has been demonstrating its willingness to contribute to strengthening  global  governance.  We hosted the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference last year, where it was made clear that there is a future after the meeting in Buenos Aires. In 2019, we will host the second High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation. We will also\nbe preparing to chair the 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, reaffirming our historic commitment to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. We are presiding over the Group of Twenty (G-20) this year in a spirit of unity and a constant quest for consensus.\nThe results being achieved give us reason for enthusiasm. In every working group and ministerial meeting a sense of collective commitment is prevailing, as was true of the Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting, where a willingness to revitalize the multilateral trading system was expressed. The first G-20 leaders summit to take place in South America will be held on 30 November in Buenos Aires. With the support of our partners, the G-20 will once again demonstrate its validity and relevance.\nThe international community is facing challenges that require effective and efficient  compromises. They demand solutions reached through  dialogue  and consensus-building. The theme  for  this  session of the Assembly emphasizes leadership and shared responsibilities for achieving equitable, sustainable and peaceful societies. Argentines are committed to doing their part to make them a reality.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to take part in the general debate of the wonderful General Assembly once again.\nThe United Nations was born from the ashes  of the Second World War, out of a deep desire to protect new generations from suffering, destruction and want. Today, those hopes still face challenges. Peace and stability have met threats in every region, too many people remain excluded from the promise of prosperity, and global terror continues to target all nations. Here in this Hall, I have called our current situation a third world war.\nThose challenges do not make collective action and mutual respect less important; if anything, they make our partnership even more important, because what is the alternative? A world without the peace and\naccord we need to work together, trade together and expand opportunity together? A world where crises are not resolved, but magnified? A world where violence spreads and more refugees flee, because we cannot work together to help people stay safe and thrive?\nWe have a long way to go to deliver global opportunity and hope, but we cannot simply give up because the task is hard. All our countries benefit when we unite in common cause. I am compelled to talk about this today, because of the critical role of collective action in ending the serious crises in my region, and especially the key crisis \u2014 the long denial of a Palestinian State.\nEvery United Nations resolution \u2014 whether from the General Assembly or the Security Council \u2014 since the beginning of the crisis recognizes the equal rights of the Palestinian people to a future of peace, dignity and hope. That is the heart of the two-State settlement and the only path to a comprehensive, lasting peace. Only a two-State solution based on international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions can meet the needs of both sides: an end to the conflict; a viable, independent, sovereign Palestinian State on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital; and a secure Israel, fully part of its own region, recognized by Arab and Muslim States around the world.\nArab and Muslim countries are committed to a comprehensive peace. The Arab Peace Initiative has been on offer for more than 16 years. Indeed, every major country in the world, the United Nations and the European Union all have worked to help the parties reach a durable peace that can last. The United States Administration has long been committed to peace and has a leading role in our progress going forward.\nYes, we have a long way to go. But  we  cannot give up because the task is hard, because what is the alternative? Can we afford to let one of the world\u2019s most strategic regions be tied to an endless cycle of violence in its midst? How long must Jerusalem, a city holy to more than half the world\u2019s people, face dangers to its multi-faith heritage and identity? How can we accept a status quo of continuing crises and bigotry? Palestinian families have been displaced for generations, their children\u2019s very identity denied, and Israeli families are living in continuing national self-isolation, without the security of peaceful relationships worldwide.\nWhat could possibly be the future of the single, binational State that some propose, whose very\n \nfoundation is a rejection of the equality of its own people? That is the ugly and undemocratic reality of the one-State idea. It is by no means an alternative to a two-State peace settlement. It  is  an abandonment  of peace, a new way to go AWOL from the work of reconciliation and the opposite of what both sides need and have sought for so long.\nThere is no such thing as a unilateral agreement;  it takes at least two parties to make an agreement. Helping the parties to achieve that agreement and work together to build a new future deserves the strong and steady support of all our world. Our countries need to pull together to get the peace process back on track. That means utterly rejecting actions that jeopardize negotiations, whether by illegal encroachments, land confiscations or threats to the welfare of innocents, especially children.\nWe need to support full funding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and other vital efforts to protect families, keep communities stable and prepare young people for productive lives. It would be a terrible mistake to abandon youth to the forces of radicalization and despair. Such support is urgently needed to ensure that UNRWA fulfils its role, in accordance with its United Nations mandate.\nAbove all, we need to safeguard the heritage and peace of Jerusalem, a city holy to billions of people around the world. The Hashemite custodianship of Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem is a duty that Jordan is proud to carry, and  we  will  counter any attempts to change the Holy City\u2019s historic Arab, Christian and Muslim identity. But Jerusalem\u2019s future is not Jordan\u2019s concern alone; it is the concern of all Member States. There are global implications when religious worship is threatened and international law is undermined.\nCollective action is also vital when it comes to resolving other conflicts and  crises  that  threaten our world. Jordan will continue to support all multilateral efforts to help Syria achieve a  political solution that  is based on the Geneva process and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), in order to safeguard the country\u2019s unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity and to create the conditions for stability and rebuilding.\nAn effective global response to terror also requires continued collective action. Let us be clear about it: for all our victories, the fight against those outlaws, the\nkhawarij of Islam, is not over. Winning the war demands a long-term, holistic approach \u2014 one that pairs security measures with strong initiatives that support inclusion and hope. Offline and online, we must counter all \u2014 I say all \u2014 ideologies of hatred, including Islamophobia. Jordanians have led efforts to unite the world in mutual respect and understanding.\nFinally, we must also strengthen our collective response to the global refugee crisis. As many here know, Jordan has carried a massive and disproportionate burden as a refugee host. Our people have opened their homes, schools, public services and hospitals. We have shared our country\u2019s scarce resources: our food, energy and precious water. The crisis has held back economic growth and job creation; jobs are urgently needed by our young people, who constitute more than 60 per cent of our population.\nJordanians have borne the refugee burden in full accordance with our country\u2019s long humanitarian  traditions, but we know, and the world knows, that the crisis is a global responsibility. The sacrifices we and other host countries make every day can continue only if donor nations hold up their side of the partnership. That means making continued, multi-track efforts in development support and humanitarian assistance. Such efforts not only prepare refugees to return home and rebuild their countries, but also give hope to the people of host countries, who have sacrificed so much.\nThe world cannot address the refugee crisis  or any global crisis unless we work together to support those who are doing the right thing for the future we all share. Peace and prosperity demand constant, collective action. The alternative is to fail our history and fail our future. Let us choose, instead, to succeed and give the world\u2019s people, especially young people, confidence in global justice, hope for new opportunity, and international laws, agreements and institutions that everyone can rely on.\n"

        "file_text": "Just a bit more than a week ago, we honoured the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan in this Hall. It was a sad but dignified occasion. It was an inspiration as we began our journey at the current session of the General Assembly. We were reminded of the unique value of the United Nations and the responsibility that we, its Members, have towards the people of the world, namely, to promote peace, development and equal rights. And, as Kofi Annan once said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more promises. We need to start keeping the promises we have already made\u201d.\n \nAnd, the time to act upon our joint commitments is indeed here. Sweden strives to act in accordance with its promises. We believe in international cooperation, in shared responsibility and participation, and in a rules-based order where international treaties and agreements are respected. When Sweden sought the Assembly\u2019s support to serve on the Security Council, we promised to act on several urgent priorities on behalf of all Members. We continue to do our utmost to keep those promises.\nLet me give only a few examples. We  have  worked consistently to reverse the trend of disrespect for international humanitarian law and to ensure humanitarian access for all those in need,  and  we have insisted on diplomacy and political solutions to entrenched conflicts. We have urged members of the Security Council to shoulder their responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations, including resisting the use of the veto; we have always sought meaningful decisions and outcomes that make a difference for people on the ground.\nWe have tried to translate the Secretary-General\u2019s vision for improved prevention into practice. We have aimed at introducing an all-inclusive approach to peace, including by analysing new risks such as climate change and the risk of famine. We have focused on ensuring the care, safety and protection of children today, as that helps to prevent conflicts tomorrow. Platforms for the stronger influence of youth have been introduced. And not least, we have worked tirelessly and systematically to strengthen the role of women in order for us to better sustain and build peace.\nWe will continue to demand women\u2019s participation in peace processes, that women\u2019s voices be heard in negotiations and in the Security Council, that United Nations mission mandates include a women  and peace and security perspective, that gender posts in missions continue to be funded and that gender aspects besystematically included in mission reporting and monitoring. We have also worked to ensure that the voices of civil society are heard at the Council table and have worked to deepen the partnership with regional organizations. However, in too many instances, the Security Council, as a collective, has failed to deliver on promises to the people whom we are meant to serve.\nIn Syria and Yemen, where two of the worst humanitarian disasters of our time are unfolding, humanitarian access is being continuously denied and\ninternational humanitarian law blatantly disregarded. In Syria, a political solution to the conflict is long overdue. Horrendous crimes are being committed against the civilian population. We must work tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice, however long it may take. In Yemen, we have yet to see a full commitment by all parties to what the Security Council has clearly stated, namely, that there can be no military solution. Instead of committing to a political process, we see an escalation of the conflict and a deterioration in an already horrific humanitarian situation.\nThe suffering of the stateless Rohingya population of Myanmar continues. The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar recently presented solid evidence of the gravity of the atrocities committed by the Myanmar military, amounting to the worst crimes under international law. Since Myanmar has systematically failed to investigate, prosecute and condemn perpetrators, the international community must shoulder its responsibility and act to end impunity. The Rohingyas should be able to return voluntarily and in safety; the Kofi Annan plan must be implemented and a credible peace processes for the outstanding conflicts must be pursued.\nA Middle East peace process remains elusive, and instead, a rapid negative development is  unfolding that includes continued disregard for international humanitarian law. Seventy years after the 1947 resolution on the United Nations partition plan for Palestine (resolution 181 (II)), and in spite of calls for United Nations resolutions to be respected, the fulfilment of the promise of a two-State solution \u2014 with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, and with Jerusalem as the capital of both States \u2014 seems very far away.\nRussia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea and the aggression in eastern Ukraine constitute violations of international law. To date, that aggression has caused more than 10,000 deaths and unacceptable human suffering. The commitments made in the Helsinki Final Act and the Budapest Memorandum must be honoured and the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements assured. In the absence of political solutions and in the face of ongoing conflicts, humanitarian efforts must be strengthened and protected.\nWe pay tribute to the courageous and selfless efforts of all humanitarian workers worldwide. Sweden has continued to deliver on our commitment to support\n \nstrong, effective and principled humanitarian action worldwide. We have increased our financial contributions to the United Nations-led global humanitarian response system and improved the effectiveness of our common efforts through our engagement in the Grand Bargain process. We have also enhanced the way in which we link our humanitarian assistance with longer-term development assistance.\nLet us not forget that there are also positive dynamics, reminding us to keep up  hope  and  never to give up the quest for peace, including in the most difficult circumstances and entrenched conflicts. In the Horn of Africa there is positive change \u2014 a testament to what a difference courageous leaders and people can make. Let us encourage and recognize that historic development, support its fulfilment and allow it to serve as an inspiration to us all. On the Korean peninsula, there is also hope that a political solution will emerge from years of escalation, high tension and  mistrust. There is unity in the Security Council as we move towards our common goal of complete denuclearization, peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula through diplomatic means.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development also brings hope. The commitments that we have collectively made have put an enormous responsibility upon us all. We need the United Nations to assist us. The reforms initiated by the Secretary-General to make the United Nations more fit for purpose are creating better conditions for us to move from promises to action. Sweden lives up to our promise to annually provide\n1 per cent of our gross domestic income to official development assistance. More than 50 per cent of that is channelled to or through the multilateral system. That reflects our belief in multilateralism and the 2030 Agenda as part of our central plan for our common future. It will require a multilateral system that is cost- effective, coherent, accountable, agile and that delivers results for people.\nThe funding compact between the United Nations and its Member States provides a unique opportunity. We, the Member States, need to improve the quality of our funding to the United Nations. This year, Sweden has already taken steps to that end by signing multi-year agreements of core support for UN-Women, the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund, the Central Emergency Response Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Relief\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the World Food Programme. Core funding is crucial for the independent delivery and efficiency of the development system.\nAnother global promise was made in Paris, when we all agreed to seriously and urgently address climate change. The gap between current commitments and the required emissions reductions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is alarmingly large. The European Union has made important progress towards reaching the targets, but we must all do more. Sweden has adopted a climate-policy framework that establishes that Sweden will have net zero emissions in 2045. We have also taken a leading role in climate finance, and we remain firmly committed to mobilizing our share of the $100 billion annually by 2020.\nThis year marks the  twentieth  anniversary  of the adoption of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court \u2014 a milestone for accountability. Political will and cooperation remain crucial for the Court in its efforts to carry out its mandate. We will continue to honour our promise to support the Court and its independence and impartiality. Sweden will also continue to stand up for the protection and promotion of human rights. There can be no development without security, and no security without development, and we will not enjoy either of them without universal respect for human rights. Global forced migration remains a challenge to many countries, and more cooperation is needed to share the responsibility for the world\u2019s refugees. At the United Nations Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September 2016, it was decided to work out two global frameworks \u2014 one on refugees and one on migration. They will increase the cooperation, accountability and structure needed to better manage the increasing refugee and migratory flows that we see today.\nIn his comprehensive and timely agenda for disarmament, the Secretary-General clearly articulated the fact that measures for arms control and disarmament play a critical role in the prevention of armed conflict. Ground-breaking international commitments have been reached. At the same time, the field of disarmament remains filled with broken and unfulfilled promises. We are witnessing a deeply worrisome nuclear renaissance, with vast modernizations of nuclear arsenals underway. Nuclear- and non-nuclear-weapon States should heed the call of the Secretary-General to engage in a dialogue and in confidence-building aimed\n \nat reducing risks and at breaking the stalemate plaguing disarmament diplomacy. The framework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is ideally suited for such efforts.\nHow can we work towards fulfilling our promises to the 50 per cent of the world\u2019s population who are women and girls? Sweden has focused on promoting equal access to rights, representation and resources. Women\u2019s voices cannot be ignored anymore; women must be included everywhere, all the time and at all levels. Global normative frameworks and international commitments on gender equality and human  rights are increasingly under attack, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights. More needs to be done to combat sexual harassment and sexual violence everywhere, in workplaces and in society at large. That pertains also to the United Nations system. The United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as on sexual harassment and assault, must urgently be turned into practice. We welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s Strategy on Gender Parity, which has made gender balance the new standard.\nWe are about to close the high-level segment of the General Assembly. In the very first intervention last week, the Secretary-General outlined the challenges to our world: a deficit of trust and the need to show the added value of international cooperation by delivering on the promise of peace, defending human rights and driving economic and social progress for women and men everywhere. International cooperation with a well- functioning multilateralism at its core are the best tools we have. So let us be the generation that acted on our promises \u2014 not just as independent States, but as the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Ten days ago I was in Ukraine, picking up syringes and empty bottles in a park next to a kindergarten in the industrial city of Dnipro. It was on the occasion of the first World Cleanup Day, the biggest-ever civil-society action facilitated by digital technologies and the will of millions to volunteer. Fifteen million people in 140 countries, among whom were many Presidents and Prime Ministers, took part and decided to do something for our planet. They were responding to the outcry of Estonians who launched the voluntary clean-up action 10 years ago. It is very easy just to talk about a cleaner environment or climate change, but if you really want to get things done, then very often you simply must get up and do it yourself.\nIn many ways, that is also the reason why Estonia is running for a non-permanent seat at the Security Council for the period 2020-2021, as small countries have no time for small objectives. Our aim, among others, is to bring all things digital to the Security Council. Cyberrisks are something that Estonians, as citizens of a fully digitized State, understand better than most. We want to offer our perspective so as to ensure that human beings remain safe in this new world where cyberrelated threats are combined with conventional ones. The vision that we have for our candidacy and\n \nfor the United Nations as a whole is based on three keywords: empathy, equality and efficiency.\nFirst, with  regard  to  empathy,  however  sad they are, we must talk about our concerns honestly. Aggression should be called aggression, war is war and occupation remains occupation. Whether we are talking about Africa or Europe, I am always deeply touched by the misery that war and conflict cause, as I am when talking with internally displaced women and children in occupied eastern Ukraine or with Georgian politicians who are told that, because of the occupation, their country will forever be denied full participation in world democratic forums that we, who are luckier than they, preciously cherish. Estonia stands in solidarity with all those affected by conflict, terrorism and violent extremism. We reach out with humanitarian aid and practical assistance, as well as our peacekeepers, from Africa to the Middle East. We do what we can, yet it feels as though it is never enough.\nOngoing military aggression in eastern Ukraine continues in the very heart of Europe. The Crimean peninsula remains occupied, as do parts of Georgia, and there is no resolution to the long-term and violent conflicts in Africa. It is hard to tolerate those tragic situations. Yet mincing words to make ourselves feel better is no solution. For those in distress, recognition of their true situation, together with the humble recognition that we cannot do much more than commiserate, is offering at least some hope \u2014  some hope that one  day things could be better; a hope that cannot feed on euphemisms avoiding straightforward admittance.\nIn July, we all reached an agreement on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and I am really looking forward to its adoption in Marrakech in December. But an agreement needs implementation. Without implementation, it is hollow \u2014 as hollow as the days ahead for those not knowing where they should lay their head for the night or how to calm their crying, hungry and frightened children. We need to get up and just go help.\nThe same applies to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In order to tackle the global challenge of climate change that is affecting billions, we must implement the commitments we have collectively undertaken, because the effects of climate change are increasingly being felt all over the world, not only in the developing countries \u2014 especially by small island States, where homes, food and even clean drinking\nwater are greatly at risk and countries are forced to jump through varied and expensive hoops in order to gain access to relief funding \u2014 but also in the developed world, where people have lost their loved ones or homes in European forest fires or in hurricanes in America and the Pacific.\nYet we are still not dealing with root causes, making the world safe for our children by applying the proper and best available technology standards to all energy production and use, both in the developed and in the developing world. We should also, very simply, never forget to switch the light off when leaving the room or get an air conditioner that stops automatically when we open the door \u2014 do what we can when we see that we cannot do it yet at the global level.\nWe are all equals in this Hall, not only because we have declared so in the Charter of the United Nations, but also because the challenges we now face are going to affect each and every one of us. Equality in the face of global challenges is just the law of nature, which is much stronger than our international law could ever be. Yet, international legal space matters, as common solutions demand respect of each and every one.\nWe see solutions in liberal thinking, but progress is not possible through polarization, fragmentation or tribalism. Progress is the force born out of debate and seeking common solutions. Sovereign equality \u2014 the idea that all sovereign States are equal \u2014 is a fundamental tenet of international law and relations. The role  of  the United Nations is to provide that equality, as a guarantor of the rules-based global system. We depend on each other, whether we like it or not.\nAnd very often it is not the State or international organizations that get things done, but the grass-roots activists and non-governmental organizations that have a vision and a sense of responsibility. A principled voluntary approach can shift mountains of inefficiency, bad governance, neglect and lack of ideas. It can guide and catalyse policymaking, but not replace it.\nRecent women movements like HeForShe have come a long way in countering gender-based and sexual violence. Gender equality is at the  very heart of human rights. With that in mind, Estonia is working actively in the Commission on the Status of  Women.  I have gladly and humbly accepted Secretary-General Guterres\u2019 invitation to co-chair the High-Level Steering Group for Every Woman Every Child for the next two years. During my tenure, I intend to raise awareness\n \nof the heroic efforts people are making globally, often working without any institutional support. I wish to demonstrate how many good ideas there are around the world \u2014 ideas that have already been found and tried, but only on a small, scale, and that help someone, somewhere, waiting to be discovered and up-scaled in order to help as many in the world as possible. I hope to provide recognition, but also the dissemination of best practices, which are often the same thing. That is how I can personally get something done.\nIn terms of efficiency \u2014 and  that  is  my  third key word \u2014 nothing is more important than truly effective multilateralism. Due to its inclusiveness, the Organization holds great legitimacy and, due to its high standards, it is a moral force. International law should be the primary yardstick of national interest. Those not so powerful, small States, understand that well.\nOn Security Council reform, we need to win more space for common ground. Peoples and States, both big and small, should feel that the Security Council acts in their best interests. Too often, the Council falls victim to its internal differences and clumsy procedures. However, it should not be rendered powerless, especially when mass atrocities are being committed.\nWe, together with the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group, have called for Security Council members to feel the responsibility and be held more accountable if they block action against breaches of international humanitarian law. It is telling that 117 States have already signed the ACT group\u2019s code of conduct. Furthermore, we unwaveringly support the proposal of President Emmanuel Macron of France, together with Mexico, the Netherlands and other States, that in the face of great human suffering, the permanent members should voluntarily refrain from the use of their veto.\nFurthermore, with respect to efficiency, information and communications technology can revolutionize entrepreneurship, education, employment in general, and even health care. Digital online services provide economic growth, bring down unnecessary barriers between citizen and State, as well as between businesses and sectors, and transcend geographical limits. Estonia has shared its knowledge with many nations of the world and will continue to do so, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme, the African Union and all those interested and willing.\nNew technologies should always be seen as enablers. They create equal opportunities if supported by proper policies. The risks related to them should not be ignored, also because they do not replace but rather enhance most of our conventional risks. But well-set international legal space should be able to deliver for humankind and avoid Armageddon scenarios.\nNo new technology can thrive in a fragmented world. Now more than ever, we need global free trade as an essential element of fostering long-term development and growth. Estonia, as a small, export-dependent country, is an advocate of free trade, including through creating better market access for developing countries and improving business conditions for investments. Trade and economy are closely linked with security, as history has so often demonstrated.\nWe stand to protect what the developed world has achieved, what the World Trade Organization stands for, and what aspiring regions and bodies have set out to achieve \u2014 for example, freedom of trade and work in Africa through legal space-setting by the African Union. We wish them speedy success, and we stand by them to help where we can with our own leapfrogging experience in digital technologies.\nEmpathy starts at home. If we want to care about others, we need to care about ourselves and about the people and environment around us. Being connected and dependent on each other more than ever, we simply cannot afford to be self-centred and ignorant. We all need to see the bigger  picture. Empathy can easily    be translated into efficiency if we really wish to get things done. Words are important, but they are not sufficient if they are not followed by concrete action.\nWars and conflicts continue, global warming is speeding up and the piles of litter around us just keep growing. We all have equal responsibility to be more proactive in preventing and  meeting  the  challenges of our times. When we are feeling helpless, it is sometimes best to do the little thing we know we are able to do. Globally, if we all do our bit, things can only get better. Our globe cannot take any more free-riding; any more hand-wringing and saying \u201cwe cannot\u201d; any more inaction; any more hiding behind our current comforts \u2014 so let us just get up and go get things done.\n"

        "file_text": "If I have the privilege and honour to speak today on behalf of the Malagasy people  before  the  General  Assembly, it is because Madagascar has gone through a  period  of exceptional democratic success, which has been warmly welcomed by many observers and seen as \u201creal democratic progress\u201d, to use the words said on that occasion. I will come back to that later.\nI extend to you, Madam President, my sincere congratulations on your election. I am confident that your\ndetermination will give new impetus to our collective efforts to consolidate our Organization with a view to making it even more credible and closer to our peoples and capable of effecting real change in their daily lives, because that is its mission. We have also heard your call and that of the Secretary-General for the strengthening of multilateralism and international cooperation in the current difficult context of fragmentation, polarization and withdrawal. Be assured that Madagascar will actively support you throughout your mandate.\nMadagascar, strongly committed to the values of unity, fraternity and peace advocated by the United Nations, intends, like all of us here who are striving to promote the welfare of our peoples, to contribute to the most representative and democratic platform for global exchange, namely, the General Assembly. All the speakers who have taken the floor in succession have highlighted the transformations taking place in the world, characterized by multipolarization, increasing economic globalization, the frenetic pace of the computerization of society and broad cultural diversity.\nMuch progress has been made but, as the Secretary- General has again pointed out, our  world  suffers  from a lack of trust, the reconsideration of policies and a very strong sense of insecurity \u2014 feelings that are exacerbated by inequalities in development  and the surge in global challenges that have not yet been mastered, such as climate change and terrorism, not to mention the iniquitous severity of poverty and disease. We are all witnessing  humanitarian  crises  caused by conflicts affecting millions of people, including migration crises, terrorist attacks and security threats in certain regions, to name but a few.\nThe theme chosen for this session places us at the heart of the major issues that drive the world today. It challenges us with regard to the role of the Organization in the face of the disruptions that are  undermining our societies today. The challenge of sustainable development and the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development require a strong and effective Organization that engages all Member States.\nThe world is changing and evolving. That requires the Organization to adapt to it in order to bring about greater coherence in its approaches and responses. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a sure way not only to establish development but also to fight inequality and guarantee human rights, with\n \na view to promoting social inclusion, a sine qua non condition for lasting peace.\nSustainable development, to which we aspire, must necessarily involve the preservation of the environment, which  must  be  a  priority  if  we  are  to more effectively eradicate extreme poverty and ensure the sustainability and viability of our planet.  In that context, I welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to convene a summit on climate change next year, and I hope that special attention will be paid to developing countries, particularly the least developed countries and small island States, so that they can adapt their economic development processes to evolving environmental hazards.\nIn this day and age, advocacy for women and girls cannot be ignored. We cannot turn a blind eye to the deplorable conditions in which many women around the world live, not to mention the many forms of gender- based violence. Girls and women remain at the heart of the future of humankind. There is therefore a need to condemn with one voice the injustices of modern slavery, trafficking in persons and the worst forms of child labour, which particularly affect women and girls. Let us give ourselves the means to improve the fate of humankind by looking after our mothers, sisters and daughters, to whom we must grant an equitable sharing of responsibilities.\nIt is also essential to act in the area of global health, which has an impact on the achievement of the SDGs, especially in Africa. Madagascar can attest to that. The obstacles have been numerous and difficult \u2014 I would just mention the improvement of access to treatment and medicines and the specific commitment of all communities, especially in terms of prevention and investment. But it is necessary to persevere, and, with the support of our partners, a universal health coverage system has been implemented. With the support of the entire United Nations family, Madagascar was declared polio-free this year.\nThe 2030 Agenda is a multisectoral programme for inclusive, equitable and sustainable development that seeks not to exclude any segment of the population. However, such a programme will remain a dead letter if it is not given the institutional and financial resources necessary to achieve its objectives. In that regard, Madagascar fully supports the  reforms  undertaken by the Secretary-General and the Secretariat. Those reforms are certainly very ambitious, but we are\ncounting on the active involvement of Member States for their implementation.\nWith regard to resolution 72/279, entitled \u201cRepositioning of the United Nations development system in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system\u201d, Madagascar welcomes the consensus that led to the adoption of that resolution in May. We also welcome the reforms undertaken at the country team level and the role of the Resident Coordinators of the United Nations system. The resolution points the way forward so that, in full consultation with, and by the mutual agreement of, Governments the system can align more quickly with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That will ensure that better account is taken of the realities, needs and priorities of Member States so that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda programme truly benefits the populations.\nIn that context, the accelerators of Madagascar\u2019s development process for achieving the SDGs were identified after implementing the mainstreaming, acceleration and policy support  strategy  at  the  end of April. The third general population and housing census of Madagascar was just completed, with the support of the United Nations system and other partners, such as the European Union. The results will provide important insights into population dynamics and development, as well as the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs. They will be taken into account when we begin to draft our next national development plan, for the period 2020-2024.\nThe ultimate goal of the United Nations system is to maintain lasting peace for development in the world. Considerable and commendable achievements attest to the progress achieved, but we must admit that much remains to be done given the persistent challenges facing the world and the unsatisfied aspirations. A world of peace and prosperity cannot be built by the isolated action of a single organization or a few individuals, communities or groups of States. It requires the implementation of convergent and consensual actions determined by the aspirations of each party.\nAlthough most countries are recognized as democracies worldwide, the option of democratic governance is still one of the contemporary political concepts that does not always enjoy unanimous support among nations. The Malagasy people, for their\n \npart, have always shown a particular interest in joint actions to safeguard democratic achievements. They have always been of the conviction that progress in democracy ensures the stability that is essential for development and is a precondition for international cooperation. We are reminded of that when we look at the historic step our country is taking in its ongoing quest for achieving mature democracy. Madagascar is today at a crossroads.\nUnder our Constitution, the presidential term is to be shortened by a few months if the incumbent President runs for his own succession. In that purer spirit of a republic, the President of the  Malagasy  Republic,  His Excellency Mr. Hery Rajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana, who was democratically elected in 2013, submitted his resignation on 7 September, thereby upholding a constitutional requirement that is certainly unusual but was felt to be necessary by the Malagasy people at a particular moment in their history.\nFor the first time, the constitutional provisions prescribing the transfer of presidential powers to the President of the Senate were implemented without any other process. The latter will therefore be responsible for ensuring the continuity of the State and the regular functioning of public services until the arrival of a new President of the Republic, whose inauguration is already scheduled for 25 January 2019. That task will include ensuring that the ongoing electoral process is properly conducted.\nIt is important to note in that respect that Madagascar is not in a phase of political transition in the sense usually understood when political divides lead to a suspension of the Constitution. On the contrary, in the present case we have simply submitted to the expression of the will of the sovereign people that is inscribed in the Constitution. The situation is part of the continuity of our national political life and is certainly marked  by a brief stage prescribed by fundamental sovereign law itself.\nThe former Secretary-General. the late Kofi Annan, said that no nation is born democratic. The situation in our country today shows a clear desire to consolidate progress towards democracy. In parallel with  that key  phase in our democracy, which is  underpinned  by a will for peace that seeks to maintain political stability at all costs, we have over the past four years been able to restore macroeconomic balance. We have seen positive changes in our basic indicators. We have\nrestored confidence and relations between national and international stakeholders, and we can therefore look forward to an economic growth rate that is expected  to exceed 5 per cent this year, which will be the best performance in 10 years. In the agricultural sector, which involves 80 per cent of the population, we have seen an increase in production and productivity, particularly in rice, thanks to public and private investment in hydro-agricultural infrastructure and research in improved and adapted seeds, as well as new practices and techniques.\nWith respect to energy, Madagascar is going through a period of energy transition. We  have  seen  a significant increase in clean and renewable energy, especially in the form of hydroelectric power plants and photovoltaic power plants, to mention only what has just been handed over to the people of Ambatolampy and Ambohipihaonana in June. I am quite proud to say that it is the largest power plant of its kind in the Indian Ocean region and among the largest in sub-Saharan Africa. Madagascar can reasonably expect a reduction in the cost of electricity by 2020 as a result of that type of project, despite the increase in the price of oil on the international market.\nExports have also performed well. The foreign exchange market has been under control, and inflation may decrease to 7 per cent by the end of the year.\nIn the social sector, education and health have improved significantly. Since 2014, we have built 24 centres for accelerating the reduction of maternal and child mortality and 315 basic health-care centres. The national radiotherapy centre will soon be completed to treat cancers. We have also set up 30 operating rooms in hard-to-reach areas.\nWith regard to education, we have been able to recruit 44,000 new teachers since 2015, representing a 30 per cent increase in the total number of teachers. We have also built 1,087 classrooms and have  fed more than 354,100 students in school cafeterias. The same improvement was recorded in the tourism sector, particularly in airport infrastructure and reception buildings. In the interest of good governance,  we  have adopted several laws  to  fight  corruption  and the illicit trafficking in our resources. The structural\n \nreform programme is well under way, including the implementation of the anti-corruption programme.\nIn short, all those data points are indicators of stability and reveal growth that  deserves  support  and consolidation. But despite all those efforts and despite the potential of the country, Madagascar is  still undergoing hardship. We are aware of the need for stability, which is the guarantee of development. The country cannot be held hostage to a political crisis any longer. The people understand that, given the fact that the country has suffered so much.\nThe example had to come from the top. That is why President Rajaonarimampianina willingly complied with the constitutional provisions by submitting his resignation. Madagascar is therefore seeking support from all of its development partners for the electoral process currently under way, the outcome of which is a source of hope for the Malagasy people. I also take this opportunity to reiterate the call to all to foster effective synergy within the Organization to promote the building of a better future, for which all nations have a right to hope.\nBefore concluding, I join my predecessors in paying tribute to a worthy son of our continent, our former Secretary-General the late Kofi Atta Annan. On the strength of his convictions, that fervent defender of multilateralism worked to rethink and build a stronger Organization that is better able to alleviate the ills of many people around the world in the name of humankind. He will undoubtedly remain a source of inspiration for all.\nFinally, I would like to conclude by recalling that this year marks the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the instrument that has best  served  humankind: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. May it continue to inspire and guide us in the struggles that still lie ahead of us for a new world order where no one will ever again be left behind. May God keep us.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to convey the greetings of His Majesty the King of Bhutan to the General Assembly and his best wishes for the success of the seventy-third session of the General Assembly.\nI also wish  to  congratulate  Her  Excellency Mrs. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her being\nelected president of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session and to assure her of Bhutan\u2019s full support. The Kingdom of Bhutan also commends His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for the successful completion of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly.\nI seek the Assembly\u2019s indulgence in allowing me to share Bhutan\u2019s observations on some of the key issues before us today. Bhutan welcomes and supports the ambitious and timely agenda of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to reform the United Nations development system in order to ensure that it is in sync with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and make the United Nations more relevant and fit for purpose. We also welcome the draft implementation plan of the Deputy Secretary-General for the inception of the new Resident Coordinator system. We have taken note of the appeal to Member States for a front-loaded voluntary contribution to the special trust fund to cover the immediate gap of the cost of a reinvigorated resident coordinator system. In that regard, Bhutan will be making a token voluntary contribution to the trust fund.\nThe reform of the Security Council must go hand in hand with the wider reforms of the United Nations system. It must accommodate the interests and concerns of all Member States, particularly of those that are underrepresented, with a view to reflecting the realities of a vastly changed global environment. The membership of the United Nations has increased fourfold over the years, and the challenges we face today have become far more complex. The institution must therefore adapt, evolve and ensure its relevance and ability to address the growing challenges of our times and fulfil our common aspirations for a more equitable, inclusive and sustainable world.\nThe reforms of the United Nations that are geared towards implementing the 2030 Agenda must provide the essential impetus needed to galvanize support for progress in areas that have been found to be deficient so that we can meet the goals and targets within the time frame set \u2014 that is, by 2030. I am happy to share with the Assembly that Bhutan is well on track towards success in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With the happiness and well-being of our people at the centre of our development efforts, Bhutan\u2019s development model of gross national happiness resonates well with the objectives of the 2030 Agenda. The repositioning of sustainable development, which is at the heart of the United Nations principle of leaving\n \nno one behind, is also in tandem with Bhutan\u2019s national development priorities.\nBhutan presented its voluntary national review on the implementation of the SDG targets at the High- level Political Forum in New York in July this year. The review enabled us to assess the progress made in our endeavours towards the implementation of the targets and achievements. I thank Member States for their keen interest and valuable feedback.\nBhutan, a tiny landlocked country in the Himalayas, started its planned development only in 1961. Under the visionary leadership of our monarchs, the industry of our people and the generous assistance from our development partners, Bhutan today is poised to graduate from the least developed countries (LDCs) category. We successfully completed our second triennial review of the Committee for Development Policy in March and have been recommended for graduation in 2023. On behalf of the Royal Government, I would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all our development partners for their friendship, generosity and support over the years.\nWhile we have achieved two of the three thresholds for eligibility to graduate from the least development country category, we have, for two successive triennials, not been able to reach the economic vulnerability index threshold. Bhutan continues to face serious challenges in terms of its narrow economic base and vulnerability to natural disasters. The economic and structural impediments to growth are also  reported  in the vulnerability profile of Bhutan produced by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\nBhutan looks forward to undertaking its graduation from LDC status in a sustainable manner by building productive capacity and economic resilience so as to ensure that there is no rolling back of hard-earned development gains. The pace of graduation must be able to absorb the withdrawal of international support measures. A smooth  transition  is  therefore  critical in order to ensure that graduation is sustainable and does not disrupt ongoing development plans and processes. The forthcoming twelfth five-year national development plan, the plan for the period 2018 to 2023, is critical, as it is Bhutan\u2019s final plan as an LDC and will serve as our transition strategy for graduation. Efforts during that period will focus on consolidating past progress and addressing the remaining last-mile challenges, so as to build a strong foundation for a\nvibrant, resilient and sustainable economy aimed at achieving the SDGs. The Secretary-General\u2019s 2018 report on the progress towards the SDGs (E/2018/64) underscored that the LDCs remain far below many of the SDG targets. Ultimately, the success of the 2030 Agenda, with its promise of leaving no one behind, hinges on the performance achieved by the LDCs.\nClimate change resulting from global warming and human activity is a serious threat not only to humankind, but also to sustainable development. Action is needed at the international, regional, national and local levels to combat that menace. The impacts  of climate change affect poorer countries and people disproportionately, as they are not able to adapt or  deal with its impacts. Since mitigating climate change means reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, which are caused by the consumption of energy in all economic and household activities, it affects everyone and  is tied to economic and energy-security issues. The ever- increasing environmental pressures of climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, soil degradation, air and water pollution, among others, have far-reaching economic and social  consequences  that  contribute to poverty and growing social inequalities. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development rightly provides a unique opportunity  to ensure that sustainable development is based on the rule  of  law,  with  a  focus on the environmental rule of law as central to sustainable development.\nPlanet Earth cannot and must not be the monopoly of Homo sapiens. It is the abode of all sentient beings. The Buddhist tenet associated with the conservation and protection of the five elements of our planet will remain as our single hope  for  survival  and  refuge for posterity. Natural disasters, such as the recent hurricanes and typhoons that have struck the United States, the Philippines, China and Japan and the devastating flood in Kerala, are not isolated incidents. How many more like them do we need? How many more experts do we need to convince us that natural disasters are aggravated by climate change? I believe that the devastation and destruction from extreme weather conditions alone cost the world approximately\n$330  billion in 2017.  Climate change also threatens  to push 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030. Climate-change refugees on a large scale will certainly become a reality. We must therefore act now and ensure at all costs that international support to tackle climate change, mobilized through the landmark\n \nParis Agreement, does not waver. It is the international community\u2019s moral  responsibility  to  the   millions of people around the world, especially those in the developing world who are disproportionately affected.\nBhutan has also been affected by extreme weather events, with increasingly frequent natural disasters such as glacial-lake outburst floods, flash floods, windstorms and landslides. They have all had a serious impact on the assets and livelihood of our people and our hard-earned development gains. Bhutan\u2019s leadership in sustainable development and environmental  stewardship  has been recognized globally. We are fortunate that past investments in environmental conservation are reaping climate dividends. Our 72.6 per cent forest cover not only serves as a carbon sink for greenhouse-gas emissions, it also provides valuable ecosystem services such as clean water for drinking, agriculture and hydropower generation. Bhutan remains committed to upholding its 2009 commitment to remaining carbon-neutral and reaffirms its pledge to fulfil its commitments to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nAlthough Bhutan is a small developing country, with a population of little more than half a million, since becoming a Member in 1971 we have always worked constructively with other Member States to realize the noble objectives of the United Nations. Among other things, Bhutan remains fully committed to the cause of international peace and security, one of the key mandates and objectives of the United Nations. Bhutan joined the fraternity of troop- and police-contributing countries in 2014 so as to be able to play a meaningful role in maintaining international peace and security, in testimony to our commitment to sharing that burden with other Member States. Since then, Bhutan has been working to gradually broaden and deepen its engagement in United Nations peacekeeping operations. I am happy to inform the Assembly that Bhutan became the first country to sign the Rapid Deployment Level agreement with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in December 2017. We have also pledged to provide an integrated formed police unit, and we stand ready to deploy a contingent whenever the United Nations calls on us to do so.\nIn 2008, Bhutan transitioned from a benevolent absolute monarchy to a democratic constitutional monarchy through a meaningful, deliberate and purposeful progression. The democratic changes in Bhutan evolved through an internal process, without external pressure or revolution. With the adoption of\nthe Constitution in 2008, our monarchs have devolved the responsibilities of safeguarding our sovereignty and security to the Bhutanese people. Since then we have witnessed two elected Governments. The second Government\u2019s term ended in August  and  the  third set of parliamentary elections are now under  way.  The primary round  of  elections  just  concluded  on 15 September, and the general round will be held on  18 October. We expect to have the next Government in place by early November.\nIn the past decade, our monarchs and our people have established a strong foundation for a functional, vibrant and intelligent democracy within the tapestry of constitutionalism and the rule of law. As we look to the future, Bhutan will continue working with Member States to ensure that  the  United  Nations  continues to play a key role in promoting peace, security and solidarity. In that regard, I would like to conclude with a quote from our beloved King, His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.\n\u201cThere cannot be enduring peace, prosperity, equality and brotherhood in this world if our aims are so separate and divergent; if we do not accept that, in the end, we are people, all alike, sharing the Earth among ourselves and also with other sentient beings, all of whom have an equal role and stake in the state of this planet and its players\u201d.\nI wish the General Assembly every success at its seventy-third session.\n"

        "file_text": "In 1945, we established the United Nations. We pledged to save future generations from the scourge of war, to work together to promote economic and social advancement, and to uphold and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. Our job is not done. Challenges remain, but progress can and must be made.\nOur common global interests are also national interests. We can achieve more when we act together. Both our prosperity and many of our challenges are the result of global trends. Trade conflicts, violent extremism, climate change and instability at the global level directly affect us at home, but so do also the benefits of world trade, the global fight against infectious diseases and the rule of law.\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals recognize that global challenges are national challenges and that they are closely interlinked. The Goals require us to take both national and international action. We must deal with the challenges of globalization, while at the same time maximizing the benefits to our citizens. Our job as leaders is to deliver security, jobs, education and\nhealth care. Working together has enabled us all to do far more than we could have done alone.\nNorway has taken national and international action through our national policy to promote sustainable livelihoods, through our Nordic and European partnerships on economic and civic integration, and through global action to promote peace and security, the sound management of the oceans, fair and regulated trade, education for all and global health measures. Together, we have achieved impressive results, because international cooperation works. Extreme poverty has been halved, people live longer, child mortality rates are falling and more girls attend school than ever before. Global political cooperation, global trade and international law have been crucial to that progress.\nWe have to recognize that globalization has not been equally beneficial to all. That is a very real challenge. Exclusion can spur radicalization. It can undermine confidence in international institutions and cooperation. Eventually, it could weaken respect for international law, human rights and even our security architecture. To counter that, we must secure the future welfare of a rapidly growing population. That requires both the protection and reform of fundamental trade norms. We cannot afford to let protectionism, discrimination and economic rivalry define our future. The World Trade Organization is essential for Norway and our interaction with the world. I believe that rules- based trade is just as important for our partners. Free trade creates winners. Protectionism does not.\nIn order to benefit all, rights, rules and responsibilities must be modernized to fit our current global economy. That is vital if we are to build a world where people\u2019s potential, creativity and hopes for the future can be realized through cooperation, the exchange of knowledge and trade. Increased protectionism forces us to reflect on what less international cooperation would entail.\nAs we agreed in 1945, all nations must unite in a commitment to maintaining international peace and security. The consequences of instability  affect  us all. Global security threats require global responses. The Security Council must be able to act, and so must we, as nations and as regional organizations. Areas of conflict and instability are breeding grounds for violent extremism and international terrorism.\nThe conflict in Syria is but one example. Many different actors, State and non-State alike, are involved.\n \nBanned weapons of mass destruction have reappeared. Humanitarian access is obstructed. Respect for human rights and international law is  undermined. On my own continent, Europe, fundamental rules and principles of international law are now in jeopardy. Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders must be restored. Violent extremism, conflict and instability lead to humanitarian crises and violations of human rights. Those in turn are some of the main drivers of both regular and irregular migration. Terrorism and violent extremism affect us all and are not limited to any single ideology, religion or belief.\nNorway is standing up against violent extremism and terrorism, not in response to individual incidents but as a long-term foreign policy  commitment.  We are one of 79 members of the Global Coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. By working together, we have achieved significant results on the ground. Still, in the continued fight against violent extremism, we must apply a whole-of-society approach. We must address the root causes, in the Middle East and elsewhere, including in our own countries and on our own continents. We must bring individual perpetrators to justice and prevent impunity.\nNorway believes that those responsible for grave violations of international humanitarian law must be held accountable. We remain a staunch supporter of the International Criminal Court as an independent institution. At the same time, security is closely linked to sustainable development. We must boost trade and job creation, build capacity for generating domestic revenue, strengthen public service delivery and combat corruption. Corruption fuels inequality, crime, instability and violence.\nConflict can reverse years of social and economic progress. Conflict  prevention, peacekeeping and disarmament are all vital if we are to achieve the Sustainable  Development  Goals.  We  should heed the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a surge in peace diplomacy. Norway is doing its part. Since the end of the Cold War, conflict mediation and resolution have been a cornerstone of our foreign policy. For more than 25 years, we have been engaged in efforts to resolve conflicts around the world \u2014 from the first Oslo Accord in 1993, to the ongoing work in Colombia and the Philippines, and back to the Middle East.\nWe have learned an important lesson from our efforts. Negotiating a peace agreement is always difficult, but implementing the agreement is even harder. In fact, conflict recurrence is more common than the onset of new conflicts. That means that the best way to prevent conflict is to ensure that peace is sustainable. Norway remains committed in Colombia, the Philippines and elsewhere, just as we remain committed to helping to achieve a negotiated two-State solution between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), demonstrated  the unique  value  of  the United Nations. We have agreed on a universal development agenda \u2014 a road map to the world we want. The SDGs are closely interlinked. Achieving Goal 16 on peace, the rule of law and strong institutions is crucial to ensuring that funds are not lost to corruption, and achieving the SDGs related to economic conditions will make funding available that can be used to make progress on other Goals. But we have no time to lose. Sustainable change cannot be brought about overnight. National ownership  is  critical,  but  civil   society, the private sector, trade unions and the scientific community all have a catalytic role to play.\nHealth is an area where it is easy to see that the SDGs apply to us all. Health is both a human right in itself and a prerequisite  for  development.  Investing in national health systems is expensive, but failing to do so can prove even more costly. The World Health Organization is working to create a global action plan for a simpler health architecture. That is a response to an initiative launched by Ghana, Germany and Norway. The action plan will be presented in Berlin in October.\nPrevention saves lives, reduces human suffering and enhances economic and social development. Norway is proud to be hosting the first replenishment conference of the Global Financing Facility in Oslo on 6 November, and will contribute substantially. Progress on one SDG will stimulate progress on others. For example, child mortality rates fall when mothers have an education.\nHowever, there are still more boys than girls who get an education. We have  to put  girls at  the centre  of our  education  efforts.  But  just  going  to  school is not enough. That is why Norway has focused on teaching quality and learning outcomes. Ensuring quality education requires continued international\n \nfinancing, and the financing gap is considerable. It is therefore important to mobilize domestic resources and private funding, alongside official development assistance. Norway is doing its part. So far this year, we have allocated approximately $440 million to global education, and we will now increase our support to education efforts targeting girls, to nearly $40 million for the period 2018-2019.\nClean and healthy oceans that are sustainably harvested are a prerequisite for reaching the SDGs. Fifty per cent of the world\u2019s oxygen comes from the oceans. Thirty per cent of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed by the oceans. Our oceans offer us enormous renewable resources and represent a source of great promise and economic potential. Almost half of the world\u2019s population already depends on the oceans for nutrition and employment, but in order to ensure a sustainable ocean economy, we must produce more from the oceans.\nHowever, the sustainability of our oceans is threatened. By 2050, they could contain more plastic than fish. Marine litter is one of the fastest growing environmental concerns. Since I started speaking, a further 200 tons of plastic have ended up in the sea. The United Nations Environment Assembly has taken a bold step and adopted a vision of zero discharge of plastic litter into the ocean. Now we must translate that into action. Managing our oceans sustainably is crucial. Increased global funding is imperative and Norway will dig deep to contribute. We have no time to lose.\nThat is why, earlier this week, I established the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, made up of Heads of  State  and  Government  from  all continents. We aim to promote science-based decision-making in the fields of ocean economy and ocean management. We will cooperate closely with the United Nations Special Envoy for the Ocean and other ocean initiatives. We aim to present our report in 2020.\nFor seven decades, Norway has been a consistent supporter of the United Nations and the rules-based multilateral order. We are one of the largest financial contributors to the United Nations. We consistently allocate 1  per  cent  of  our  gross  national  income  to development aid. There is broad support for the United Nations and for our engagement in sustainable development and peace across the political spectrum.\nIn 2021 it will have been 20 years since Norway previously held a seat on the Security Council. We\nare ready to serve again. If we are elected, we will work to make the Security Council more transparent, efficient and representative. We will work with other Member States, regardless of their size, wealth or geographical location, to find common solutions. We will draw on our experience in peace and reconciliation processes. As women\u2019s rights and participation are crucial to lasting peace and stability, we will  keep that issue high on our agenda. Together with partners from many regions, Norway will support initiatives for sustainable oceans and forests. We will highlight the consequences of climate change and the links between security and sustainable development. We will promote reform of the Council to make it more transparent, representative and better equipped to deal with current global realities. Norway will continue to be a consistent partner of the United Nations. We will continue to seek common solutions to the challenges that we face in our shared future."

        "file_text": "At the outset, it gives me pleasure to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s and her friendly country, Ecuador, on her election as President of the General Assembly at the current session. I wish her success in that noble task. I also want to express my appreciation to Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k and his friendly country, Slovakia, for his successful leadership of the previous session.\nI would be remiss not to express my appreciation for the efforts of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to promote the role of the Organization in achieving security, peace and development throughout the world, and our appreciation and support for the reforms and initiatives that he has undertaken since assuming office.\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our sincere condolences to the family of the late Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, and to the African continent, recalling his invaluable work in the service of international peace and security while supporting human rights and contributing effectively to the Organization\u2019s development and reform.\nThe theme of this session \u2014 \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and\n \nsustainable societies\u201d \u2014 reflects our shared aspirations for a global organization capable of effectively addressing current challenges. It also underscores our joint desire to enhance the Organization\u2019s role in the service of peace and security, while building more equitable and effective international relations and strengthening sustainable development efforts.\nWe believe that tackling those challenges is a matter of joint responsibility, calling for intense and concerted efforts to eradicate hotbeds of tension, armed conflicts and disputes, as well as the unprecedented human suffering they inflict. Those hotbeds also exacerbate the phenomenon of terrorism and violent extremism, as well as all forms of organized crime, in addition to a decline in growth rates and increases in poverty and marginalization, together with economic recession in many parts of the world.\nIn that regard, Tunisia reaffirms the responsibility of the international community, as  represented  in  our Organization, to pursue the  political  settlement of ongoing disputes, resolve conflicts by peaceful means, achieve security and stability and promote human rights for the sake of safe and sustainable societies. While we are pleased  with the  results of  the negotiations on the  major  reforms  initiated  by the Secretary-General, particularly in reviewing the international system pertaining to security and peace and promoting development on a regular basis, we hope that those reforms will be supported by effective contributions from all States Members of the United Nations in accordance with a comprehensive vision that entrenches the principles of partnership and equality in international relations, as well as equitable representation on the Security Council, while enabling the General Assembly to take on its full responsibilities in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. True to the firm principles of our foreign policy, Tunisia will spare no effort in working to effectively contribute to the efforts to realize those noble objectives.\nTunisia continues to steadfastly enhance democratic governance and a State based on law and institutions through a consensual and participatory approach across the political spectrum and every sector of Tunisian society. Over the past year,  we  have taken further steps to strengthen constitutional institutions and fight corruption while enhancing good governance. We held democratic municipal elections in May to operationalize the very important constitutional principle of participatory democracy and decentralized\nlocal governance. Through that principle, we hope to promote local development programmes and reduce disparities between entities.\nLike the presidential and legislative elections held in 2014, those municipal elections resulted in a high level of representation of young people and women, reflecting an awareness in Tunisian society of the importance of including women and young people in decision-making at the local and national levels.\nBased on our belief in human rights and fundamental freedoms as two of the pillars of democracy, and in accordance with our international commitments and the provisions of the 2014  Constitution,  President  B\u00e9ji Cai\u0308d Essebsi of Tunisia has launched a reform initiative to enhance equality and the status of women, with a dedicated committee established to that end. That initiative is currently subject to a comprehensive dialogue engaging participants from across Tunisian society. As such, it is a natural extension of Tunisia\u2019s pioneering experiment in reforms aimed at establishing a progressive society that respects individual rights and collective freedoms, empowers women and achieves full equality between men and women.\nWe are aware that enhancing and sustaining the emerging sustainable democratic experience in Tunisia are contingent on achieving economic recovery, addressing our current difficulties and strengthening social harmony. Those are priority objectives for our Government, in line with our 2016-2020 national development plan and in the context of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nTunisia remains committed to pursuing major reform to improve growth rates and other human development indicators, in particular by creating work opportunities for young people and promoting internal and external investment. Despite major security and development challenges, including the destabilization of the regional and international situations and its direct effect on Tunisia\u2019s security, growth and economic interests, we recently recorded positive and encouraging results \u2014 rising growth, falling unemployment and trade deficits, and recovery in the tourism sector, with an increase in investment indicators. We believe that those positive indicators enhance Tunisia\u2019s status as an attractive environment for regional and international investment.\nTunisia depends not only on its own national capabilities but also on strong relations of cooperation\n \nand partnership with regional and international partners. We would like to affirm our appreciation for the support that the Tunisian experiment has received from our long-standing friends and partners the world over and to stress our interest in further expanding such cooperative partnerships to serve our shared interests and strengthen security and stability nationally and internationally.\nTerrorism represents one of the most prominent challenges to our countries, with no exceptions. It is also one of the gravest challenges to international peace and security. Terrorist organizations seek to destabilize countries, spread chaos and obstruct development. To confront that threat, we underscore the central role played by the United Nations in supporting Member States in eliminating terrorism and violent extremism. In that regard, we consider the establishment of the Office of Counter-Terrorism an important step for better coordinating and enhancing multilateral cooperation in that area.\nWhile national, regional  and international  efforts to combat terrorist activities  are  important, we believe it is an equally important  priority  to tackle extremist ideologies and protect our societies, particularly young people, against secrecy and extreme violence. We also stress the importance of supporting international cooperation mechanisms for the exchange of information, expertise and judicial assistance and providing support to countries at the forefront of combating that scourge.\nTunisia has made significant progress in implementing its comprehensive  national  strategy  to combat terrorism and violent extremism,  which  has helped us to realize security gains in terms of tackling that dangerous scourge, thwarting terrorist plots, bringing terrorists to justice and safeguarding democracy while respecting the rule of law\nIn recent years, the world has witnessed an unprecedented upsurge in flows of refugees and migrants resulting from protracted crises, worsening armed conflicts  and related human suffering, disrupted security, hampered development and a lack of the conditions necessary for a decent life. Despite its  increase in recent years, migration remains one   of the principal manifestations of interaction and communication among human societies. Throughout history, it has contributed to rapprochement among cultures and civilizations. We believe that tackling\nmigration and refugee flows requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that takes into account the root causes of the two issues and prioritizes the importance of providing a dignified life for refugees and migrants, respecting their rights and human dignity and protecting them from criminal networks and all forms of exploitation.\nWe must mobilize international efforts to address the underlying causes of migration, including the inadequate sustainable development in many countries of origin. There is also a need to address exacerbated conflicts and wars, as well as the international community\u2019s failure to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries.\nTunisia hopes that the two United Nations global compacts on migration and refugees will pave the way to the international consensus needed on this issue. We underscore the importance of promoting cooperation among all components of the international community in order to settle disputes and support the development efforts of Member States, as well as of promoting avenues for organized migration. While we understand the apprehension of some States, we emphasize the need to put a stop to hostile activities and practices against migrants and refugees and all forms of extremism, including in political discourse and media campaigns, when addressing the issue.\nContinued conflicts and regional and international crises unquestionably result  in  increased  tension and a lack of stability and security. In that respect, achieving the desired just, comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question is an urgent priority. It would enable us to restore peace and stability to the Middle East region, thereby allowing our brother Palestinian people to recover their legitimate rights and establish an independent State of Palestine on their territory, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with resolutions of international legitimacy, the Arab Peace Initiative and a two-State solution.\nTunisia calls on the international community to shoulder its responsibility to provide the necessary protection for the Palestinian people  and  preserve  the legal and historical status of the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif, as well as all other occupied Palestinian territories. Tunisia has spared no effort within its own abilities to provide support to the Palestinian people and implores the international community to redouble its efforts in order to put an end to Palestinians\u2019\n \nhumanitarian suffering. That includes supporting the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East so that it can continue to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees.\nTunisia is deeply concerned about the developments in Libya and the serious deterioration of the security situation in its capital, Tripoli. Tunisia renews its commitment to undertaking efforts \u2014 at the initiative of President Essebsi, and in full cooperation with our brother countries of Egypt and Algeria \u2014 to assist  our Libyan brothers in overcoming their differences. Precedence should be given to Libya\u2019s interests so that the desired political settlement can be achieved through dialogue and reconciliation on the basis of the Libyan Political Agreement, facilitated by the United Nations.\nIn that regard, Tunisia underscores its support for the United Nations Action Plan for Libya and calls for uniting all efforts to address the Libyan crisis, without interfering in Libyan internal affairs and avoiding military options, in order to achieve peace and security, lessen the suffering of the Libyan people and accelerate the implementation of the Action Plan.\nWe also call for regional and international efforts to be redoubled in order to arrive at a comprehensive political solution to the crisis in Syria as soon as possible, in a way that preserves the unity and territorial integrity of that brotherly country and puts an end to the suffering of the Syrian people while achieving their aspirations for security, stability and democracy.\nWe also hope that the international community will be able to help the parties in Yemen begin a dialogue in order to arrive at a political solution that supports legitimacy while preserving the unity of that brotherly country, as well as its territorial integrity. We hope that such a solution will end the suffering of the Yemeni people and guarantee the safety, security and stability of the Arab Gulf region.\nGiven our joint responsibility to ensure a universal system for the promotion of human rights for all, including the right to security and life, we call for accelerating the efforts to address the issue of Rohingya Muslims while ensuring the safe and voluntary return of refugees and working to tackle the underlying causes of the crisis.\nConsidering the importance with which we view being part of the African continent, which represents our strategic depth, Tunisia supports joint African efforts.\nWe are committed to the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 development plan and are ready to actively engage in advancing the continent\u2019s prospects. We would also like to appeal to the international community to assist in promoting peace and security on the continent so that the peoples of Africa can achieve their aspirations for sustainable development and economic integration.\nIn  that  context,   Tunisia   greatly   appreciates the agreement between the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea to end the long-standing dispute between the two countries. It has given new impetus to bilateral cooperation in the interests of the two neighbouring peoples on a path to achieving security, stability and development. Tunisia also hopes that that historic reconciliation between the two countries can be a first step towards ending all differences in the Horn of Africa region and setting an example to be followed in terms of eliminating tensions and settling disputes on the entire African continent.\nWith regard to the situation in the Korean peninsula, we are pleased with the results of the recent summits between the President of South Korea and the leader of North Korea, as well as the summit between the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea. We note the historic transformation of the Korean peninsula and the commitment of the two Koreas to cooperating in the future.  We  hope  that the international community will make  every effort  to assist both countries in ending tensions on the Korean peninsula and restoring trust between them by denuclearizing the peninsula and ridding it of weapons of mass destruction in order to achieve peace.\nWith Arab and African support, Tunisia is ready to join the Security Council once again as a non-permanent member for the period from 2020 to 2021. It is a goal that we hope to achieve with the support of all our friends and partners in the international community. If elected, Tunisia will work throughout its membership of the Council to ensure its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations, as well as its readiness to promote consultations. We would emphasize the importance of arriving at acceptable solutions to all the items on our agenda in the service of world peace and security.\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Tunisia\u2019s commitment to continue to make every possible effort to cooperate with all sisterly and friendly countries in order to achieve the noble objectives of the United Nations in\n \nthe service of humankind in order to uphold those lofty universal values.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to be here for the opening of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would like to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her recent assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly and to thank Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his exceptional work as our outgoing President.\nThe theme chosen for this year\u2019s debate \u2014 \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people\u201d \u2014 is deeply resonant for this representative of a small island developing State (SIDS). It is so self-evident that it borders on clich\u00e9 to state that some communities have not benefited from the current global economic system. Yet it bears repeating again and again lest those places be forgotten entirely. The Republic of Nauru is one such place, and it is to the United Nations that we look for assistance. However, to be responsive to the needs of my country and many others like it, we must address a systemic bias within the United Nations and start thinking small.\nThe population of Nauru is a little over 10,000.  Let me try to capture some of the challenges we encounter in accessing the support available from the United Nations by sharing a story from my days as the country\u2019s Director of Education. Eager to participate in an education-data tracking programme offered by UNESCO, I logged onto its website and began to input the required information for registering my country. The first question was straightforward: number of primary schools. I typed in the number 6 \u2014 not 600,\nnot 6,000, but \u201c6\u201d \u2014 and the response read \u201cerror\u201d. I moved on to the second question: number of teachers. I typed in 59 \u2014 \u201cerror\u201d again. I was not able to register for that promising education programme. But I did learn an important lesson that day. It is not easy to gain access to support from the United Nations system when one is representing a small country.\nOur unique challenges as SIDS are widely recognized. Some are inherent in the geophysical nature of the islands we inhabit, such as a small land mass, limited natural resources, geographic isolation and vulnerability to natural disasters. No less important are the challenges imposed on us by the global economic system, which was not  designed with our countries   in mind. Our small populations and production base do not yield the economies of scale sought by private investors. Volatility in commodity markets has an outsize impact on our fiscal planning. The negative externalities of consumption-based economic growth have destroyed the health of our oceans and the safety of our climate.\nMeanwhile, corporate consolidation and a liberalized global financial system translate into  fewer and fewer opportunities for small enterprises to develop domestically. That leaves us with extremely underdeveloped economies, overly reliant on one or two key sectors that are often highly vulnerable to changing global market trends or shifts in the political priorities of our development partners. SIDS typically score extremely high on economic vulnerability indices for that reason, and Nauru is no different. While today we may be considered a middle-income country under certain metrics, our economic situation could change dramatically for the worse overnight owing to forces that are completely out of our hands.\nThose observations are not new. We have been grappling with such challenges for decades. But in the face of climate change, developing effective strategies for dealing with them has become much more urgent. I think it is fair to say that the logic of the entire global economic system is driven by a relentless pursuit of larger and larger scale. In the name of efficiency, private enterprises expand operations in places with large pools of cheap labour or vast reserves of resources. They merge with competitors to increase market share. They seek out the greatest profit centres and abandon those that underperform. Talk to any newly minted graduate with a master\u2019s degree in business administration about a new business idea, and the first question he or she\n \nwill ask is \u201cDoes it scale?\u201d I dare say that that logic has permeated the United Nations system. Why design a programme to help a country of 10,000 people when one can theoretically help 10 million? Why wade through all the loan paperwork to replace a small diesel generator when the same number of documents can mobilize funding to transform a much larger energy system? If my country is too small to even warrant inclusion in a simple online database, where does that leave us?\nFor the smallest countries, the micro-States, conventional pathways to development are not available to us. We simply cannot offer the profit potential that private investors seek. We must therefore look to public institutions \u2014 to the United Nations \u2014 to create an environment in which the rest of us can grow and prosper. The Republic of Nauru cannot be treated as an \u201cerror\u201d. When viewed through the lens of conventional economics, our lack of scale is our problem. If we are to address the challenges of small islands, therefore, we have to abandon the conventional wisdom. We have to think about scale differently. Once we take that leap, our small size can become our greatest advantage.\nEarlier this month, Nauru had the honour to host the forty-ninth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting. The theme of the meeting \u2014 \u201cBuilding a strong Pacific: our people, our  islands,  our  will\u201d  \u2014  was  chosen  to highlight the uniqueness of our region and the imperative that we chart our own course to sustainable development. Traditional and new partners alike joined us at the Pacific region\u2019s first round table on Sustainable Development Goal 17 to announce new initiatives in the areas of energy, health care and protection of the oceans. The event was successful because our partners recognized the opportunities in our small  islands. The countries that demonstrated no respect for the sovereignty of the small and vulnerable or for the leaders of the Pacific and the regional process were respectfully asked to yield the floor to those that did.\nSmall can be nimble. Small means that modest resources can have a transformative impact.  When our sustainability metrics are aggregated with those of the rest of the world, we become nothing more than a rounding error. But when joined by partners that are prepared to understand our constraints, we can become living proof that a better, more  sustainable  way  of life is possible. With regard to renewable energy, for example, a few small islands have made enormous progress in the past few years and are looking to achieve 100 per cent renewable-energy systems within\na decade, a tremendous achievement. That is a much more difficult undertaking in large countries, which must serve population centres spread across a much wider geographical area, navigate a minefield of politically powerful incumbents and bear much higher financial costs.\nWe can see some of our Pacific island neighbours racing to the front, with the rest of us clamouring to follow their lead. We are ready to seize the opportunity presented by cheap solar energy and free ourselves from the expensive burden of fossil fuels. Capacity and resource constraints are the only things holding us back. My Government\u2019s own analysis puts the cost of moving Nauru to 100 per cent renewable energy at\n$63 million. For a modest investment, the world would have visible evidence that the future we want \u2014 a clean, zero-carbon society \u2014 is well within our grasp. That transformation would also dramatically improve our fiscal outlook, providing a much stronger foundation for progress in other areas of sustainable development.\nJust because the  task is  smaller  does  not  mean it is easy. But there are simple steps to be taken that would dramatically improve our situation. Financial and capacity-building resources need to be made more accessible for our capacity-constrained countries. Streamlined and harmonized application and reporting procedures would significantly alleviate one of our largest hurdles. In addition, new funding approaches, such as direct-access modalities and direct budgetary support, seem to yield much better results in small countries. Adequate financing must be available for basic infrastructure, not just for the development fads of the moment. The Pacific region\u2019s partnership with the Government of Italy has been a resounding success because it has been structured with those issues in mind. The model works because it regards the Pacific islands as the primary drivers of their own development. When working with the Government of Italy we know that the tremendous respect that they have shown us has nothing to do with the size of our countries.\nBuilding a more inclusive United Nations also requires addressing the most urgent global challenges, which include the security implications of climate change. In that regard, I would like to reiterate the call I made in July in the Security Council for the appointment of a special representative of the Secretary- General on climate and security (see S/PV.8307). We are already seeing dangerous effects on our countries and communities, with the most vulnerable among us\n \nbearing the greatest burden. A special representative, supported by a well-resourced staff, is needed to help us start managing climate risks more effectively. That is a critical gap in the United Nations system that must be filled immediately.\nMaking the United Nations relevant to all people must include the people of Taiwan. The treatment of the people of Taiwan should be equal to that of other nations. The United Nations should resolve the serious issue of the exclusion of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people from the United Nations system. The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations clearly states that the Organization\u2019s mission is\n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\u201d.\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the Governments of Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Japan, India, the Russian Federation, Italy, Israel and Cuba, as well as the European Union for their assistance to Nauru. We value their friendship very much and look forward to our continued collaboration.\nWe applaud the President for choosing to promote a theme of inclusion in this debate. In the pursuit of scale, it is easy to forget that many of  the smallest  and most vulnerable often fall through  the  cracks. My Government stands ready to work with her during the seventy-third session of the General Assembly to build a United Nations that brings peace and equitable and sustainable societies to all people. God bless the Republic of Nauru. God bless the United Nations. God bless us all.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, where we have come to renew our commitment to creating an enabling environment for all humankind.\nThe theme of this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to  all  people:  global  leadership  and shared responsibilities for peaceful,  equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, has great resonance with resolution 72/279, adopted on 31 May, which aims at the repositioning of the United Nations development system to better support countries in their achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under strong national leadership and with international cooperation.\nWhen the United Nations was established in 1945, its main purpose was to reduce tensions and avert another conflict following the Second World War. Since then, we have converged as a family at the General Assembly to renew this commitment and analyse how we address challenges affecting the world. It is a time to assess whether we are still living up to the ethos of the founders, who sought to ensure that the world would never again endure another world war, but rather find peaceful solutions to resolving possible conflicts.\nWe are all aware of the pockets of tension existing in different regions of the world, which require that States Members of the United Nations speak with one voice when offering possible peaceful solutions. Since a fragmented approach would render peaceful solutions elusive for affected countries, it  is  imperative  that we engage and resolve issues together as the United Nations family in order to ensure that we end up with lasting solutions.\nWe appeal to the countries experiencing conflict situations to come up with home-grown solutions to address their differences. We urge these nations to\n \navoid the use of force in an attempt to impose change. Where they do not see eye to eye, they need to adopt dialogue as the best way to find lasting solutions. Where there is no loss of blood, unity prevails, whereas violence begets instability.\nThose who have lost lives and property in conflicts do not forget, and their bitterness makes nation-building efforts much harder to achieve. States Members of the United Nations are strongly urged to avoid fuelling tensions in troubled countries with a divided approach to intervention, as that defeats the purpose of the establishment of the United Nations. Our approach should always be, for the greater good of humankind, to search for and find an amicable way forward to address all the challenges we face.\nAnother great concern is the imbalance between rich and poor, which continues to deepen by the day despite our efforts to implement the Sustainable Development Goals, which were designed to bridge that divide. As the United Nations family, we  need    to pay serious attention to those imbalances, as they contribute to terrorism and social strife in the world.\nThe African Union has also set out to improve lives with the goal of realizing a well-developed Africa for all by 2063. It is important to support such programmes, which are similar to initiatives undertaken in other regions of the world, some of which have shown great progress in  that  regard.  We  urge successful  blocs to meaningfully support developing countries that have adopted good programmes to transform their economies but lack the means to do so. The slow process of development in such countries adds to the burden resulting from their failure to provide for  the needs   of our people and our society. We need to find ways and solutions to speed up the process of developing sustainable economies by removing the stumbling blocks to development, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.\nIt is perhaps time that we engage researchers to find out what developing countries need in order to fast-track economic growth and identify high-turnover capital projects that would be best suited to catalyse such an endeavour. No country deserves to go for a whole year without any investment. There are numerous successful countries that can share their experiences of success. Their insights could assist developing countries in ensuring that no country is left behind as we strive to achieve our development objectives.\nThe African continent remains challenged by various diseases, including Ebola, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and many others, each of which requires large amounts of funding if they are to be overcome. Africa has resolved to eliminate those diseases in a short amount of time. However, without funding, that will remain a challenge. Some of those health issues require further analysis given that, in some cases where we have had success, we subsequently had to deal with their re-emergence in a more virulent form.\nIt would be remiss of us not to thank and commend the support lent by members of the United Nations family to countries in need, especially for health issues in Africa. We need to ensure that every citizen has access to basic services, such as clean water, health care and free primary education. We commend those countries that have reached the level of being able to provide free education. It is only by investing in education that nations may produce the highly qualified citizenry that enables them to realize their full development potential.\nReducing unemployment is a global challenge, so too is caring for the elderly, a group that has contributed immensely to the development of each country. They deserve to be cared for once they have done their part. Addressing those issues is becoming increasingly challenging given the decline in donor funding, which means more hardship for our people. We should therefore seek alternative means of fundraising so as to avoid the undesirable situation in which people have to resort to self-help in order to cope with the global challenges. Such an approach threatens peace, as it could lead to the diversion of resources from efforts  in place to address already existing challenges, such as diseases.\nIt is unfortunate  that the African continent continues to attract more United Nations peacekeeping missions than any other region in the world, which qualifies Africa for proper representation in  the peace and security arena and makes it  a  key  player  in discussions on issues of peace and security in all structures of the United Nations. We therefore make the appeal for Africa not to be left behind. Its voice must be heard and featured prominently and permanently at the United Nations.\nAs negotiations of reform of the Security Council progress, the Kingdom of Eswatini calls for the favourable consideration of the African common position, as well as the support of those countries that\n \nare not members of the Security Council. Africa calls for the allocation of no less than two permanent seats on the Security Council, with all of the prerogatives and privileges of permanent membership \u2014 including the veto power \u2014 and five non-permanent seats.\nWe remain confident that the SDGs and Agenda 2063 of  the  African  Union  will  continue  to  give  us the proper guidance and impetus needed to eradicate poverty and create inclusive and sustainable development for all. The Kingdom of Eswatini has made significant strides in adapting  the  SDGs  at  the local level and integrating them into its national planning processes. We have finalized a  review  of our 1997-2022 national development strategy and will soon be launching a revised national strategy with the theme \u201cDevelopment strategy for Eswatini: promoting sustainable development and inclusive growth\u201d. The strategy is expected to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs in the Kingdom.\nIn a bid to facilitate research and development, the Kingdom of Eswatini is fully committed to working towards a knowledge-based economy through the development of science, technology and innovation infrastructure. The Royal Science and Technology Park continues to be a key entity aimed at advancing research in the scientific and related fields. We would like to express our profound gratitude to the friends of the Kingdom who are supporting us in our endeavour to develop those fundamental initiatives. However, as innovation, research and development are constantly evolving, such efforts are a work in progress. The Kingdom therefore continues to seek additional support so as to further strengthen initiatives that contribute to attaining our national Vision 2022 and the Sustainable Development Goals.\nOnly a few days ago, the people of the Kingdom of Eswatini held a very peaceful national election that was free and fair. We are glad that international observers were in attendance to monitor the elections and that their conclusions were in line with our expectations. During the elections, the people nominated candidates in their chiefdoms to compete at the constituency level, using a system we call Tinkhundla. The system ensures direct participation and promotes participatory democracy among our people. It is home grown, part of our customs and traditions, and enshrined in our Constitution.\nWe fully support the participation of women in political decision-making positions and have recently\nenacted the Election of Women Members to the House of Assembly Act in order to ensure their representation in Parliament. We have also successfully enacted the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act, a legal framework to protect women from domestic violence and sexual assault. That legislation will give effect to the relevant international legal instruments, including, inter alia, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\nWe are pleased to inform the General Assembly that, earlier this year, our Kingdom celebrated 50 years of independence. We are grateful that the country has been able to champion its development agenda as a free nation for 50 years. During the celebration, the nation decided to revert to its original name, Eswatini. Since time immemorial, the name of the Kingdom has always been Eswatini.\nI would like to emphasize that the call of the United Nations to leave no one behind requires identifying them, knowing where they are and  understanding  how they live, as well as determining how they can be assisted and brought to par with the rest of the world. Answering those questions will go a long way towards making the United Nations more relevant to all peoples of the world.\nWe would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the negative impact that being categorized as a middle-income country has had on our access to external resources. Our designation as a middle-income country has come at a time when we need even more resources to be able to inject innovation into the development programmes that we have undertaken pursuant to the SDGs. We sincerely hope that the commendable reform efforts of the Secretary-General will help to support and strengthen our efforts aimed at gaining access to external resources and securing sustainable funding mechanisms so as to enable us to move towards fully realizing the SDGs by 2030.\nThe Kingdom of Eswatini reiterates its unwavering stance as it calls  on  the  United  Nations  to  afford the people of the Republic of China, Taiwan, the opportunity to contribute to and partake in the United Nations development system. Taiwan\u2019s experience in fields that are vital to various dimensions of sustainable development would go a long way towards contributing to the work and well-being of the membership of the\n \nUnited Nations. We wish to make a strong appeal for the people of Taiwan not to be left behind, with a view to keeping the United Nations relevant to all people, in line with the spirit of universality.\nIn conclusion, I would like to extend my congratulations to the President of the General Assembly on her election to preside at the seventy-third session of the Assembly. We commend the General Assembly for having such confidence in her as to choose her to serve as only the fourth woman President of the General Assembly in its 73 years of existence. I would like to assure her of my Kingdom\u2019s full support as she executes her duties and responsibilities during her term of office. We further appreciate the Secretary- General and all his staff for their continued support and hard work to improve the working mechanisms and relevance of the United Nations system for all Member States. We hope to come out of this session with meaningful goals that will chart a better future for our respective countries.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first join all the other speakers in congratulating and wishing success to President Espinosa Garc\u00e9s. Albania wishes to assure her of our full support in her tasks and mission.\nThe theme of this general debate, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all  people\u201d,  takes  us  to the heart of multilateralism, the kind that our nations have built through global leadership and shared responsibilities for the benefit of peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. While we  share the belief  in the need for the constant pursuit of reform, we remain faithful to the fundamental principles of the Organization. We continue to see the United Nations\n \nas a multilateral instrument through which peaceful international order is safeguarded.\nThe United Nations was created in a concert of sovereign wills that produced a corpus of rules and good practices to guide our efforts to find global solutions to global problems. The United Nations has no life of its own outside the will of its Members, nor is it immune to evolving changes and developments. The United Nations has grown as the world has become more global. The issues of democracy, human rights, security, development, technological advances  and the worldwide web, the environment and many more increasingly feature on the United Nations agenda, just as they dominate our domestic policies.\nAlbania takes seriously its responsibility to be active in this debate and thereby add relevance to our part of the world. It is in that spirit that we fully support the vision of Secretary-General Guterres for reform and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals at the national, regional and international levels. We strongly believe that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is universal, because it is relevant and applicable to all the countries of the world. Albania has taken a clear stance through a unanimous resolution adopted by the Albanian Parliament that  expresses our firm commitment to implementing and achieving those Goals.\nAlbania presented its national voluntary report in July, incorporating a combination of its European agenda objectives with those of sustainable development. I would like to emphasize that those strategic documents\nare fully compatible and in line with our national strategic project for European integration. Albania\u2019s national strategy for development and integration enshrines the same strategic vision and objectives for development \u2014 good governance, the rule of law, a competitive and sustainable economy and the promotion of, and respect for, human rights and fundamental freedoms. As we look forward to a future decision to open accession negotiations with the European Union (EU), we remain committed to progress, with domestic reforms in key areas.\nWe also consider the EU prerogative of open regional cooperation to be an indispensable policy. With ongoing processes aimed at maintaining peace and integration in the Balkans, we believe that every bilateral achievement among our countries contributes directly to greater peace, security, stability and economic development. We consider that the recently reached agreement between Greece and Macedonia has the opportunity to become a historic achievement. We have called on all political actors in Macedonia, including local Albanian leaders, to be actively engaged in ensuring the success of the referendum to be held  on 30 September and to support a vote  in favour of the agreement.\nNATO\u2019s open-door policy towards the Western Balkans remains vital and will be decisive in anchoring the region to the NATO security umbrella and ensuring responsible local ownership. In that context, I strongly welcome the recent messages that our strategic partners sent to Macedonian citizens. Those messages echo their determination to uphold the immense investment over the past two decades in establishing stability and security in the Balkans. The combined commitment of both NATO and the EU is the best guarantor for all the countries and citizens in our region.\nThat positive momentum can also nurture further progress in the EU-led dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia. The dialogue has entered its final stage and   is expected to be concluded with a legally binding agreement on the comprehensive normalization of relations between the two States. It is of paramount importance that the expected agreement should embody positive energy while fostering the European values of inter-ethnic coexistence and harmony. It is extremely important that the agreement mark a breaking away from history and the past and improve the daily lives of the peoples in both States.\n \nLet us bear in mind that for  the  Balkans,  the  past is notoriously linked to border changes, ethnic cleansing and violent massive displacements. However, over  the past two decades, the region has undergone   a tremendous transformation, thanks to the support and involvement of the United Nations and the serious political, social and economic investments of the United States of America and the EU. We call on and welcome every effort on the part of the States Members of the United Nations to promote the international recognition of Kosovo and further support its membership in regional and international organizations. Based on the stability and positive developments in Kosovo, Albania supports a reduction in the number of meetings held  by the Security Council on the reports on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.\nAlbania fully supports a more effective United Nations agenda through a more integrated peace and security architecture, with peacekeeping  operations as vital instruments and a flagship activity of the United Nations. We support the recent Action for Peacekeeping initiative of the Secretary-General, and we have endorsed the declaration on that initiative. Albania fully supports Security Council resolution 2242 (2015) and the substantively similar resolutions that were adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on the review of the peacebuilding architecture (resolutions 70/262 and 2282 (2016)). We remain confident that Secretary-General Guterres  will keep up the momentum for a revitalized role for the United Nations, with a special focus on peace and security in the world. His platform for the revitalization of the United Nations is promising, and we support it. Allow me to note that more than 6,500 members of the Albanian armed forces and civilians have participated in international peacekeeping operations since 1996. They have contributed to operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chad, South Sudan, Afghanistan and other countries. We have pledged to continue our modest but steady contribution.\nAlbania has been aligned with all of the United Nations initiatives aimed at fighting terrorism and has ratified 12 of the 19 related United Nations conventions and protocols. Albania joined the immediate response as part of the global struggle against violent extremism and, notably,  the Global Coalition against Daesh. As a NATO member, we tripled our troop contribution to Afghanistan last year. Our contribution is a significant part of the collective efforts to fight illegal migration\nin the Mediterranean Sea. We are part of the NATO maritime mission in the Aegean Sea and assist the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in stopping migrant smuggling. Albania believes that the protection of civilians, women and children is of crucial importance in peacekeeping operations, because the life of every person is precious.\nWe welcome the  growing  attention  to  the  role of regional organizations in security issues. In that connection, we greatly appreciate and welcome the close cooperation between the United Nations  and  the European Union on the platform of the Common Security and Defence Policy. If we are to have a safer and more peaceful planet, concrete steps must be taken. In that regard, Albania hails the progress that  has been made under the leadership of the United  States of America on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and considers it a very positive step forward, not only for that region but the entire planet.\nAnother issue of serious concern threatening peace and security is the ongoing conflict in Syria. We support all the actions taken by the international actors to end the conflict and stop the use of chemical weapons. The humanitarian situation has worsened, and that tragedy has produced millions of displaced persons and war refugees, which also threatens the security of neighbouring countries and the European continent.\nThe situation in Libya also continues to seriously concern us, and we affirm our strong commitment to the unity and territorial integrity of Libya and emphasize the need to de-escalate the violence there and combat the spread of terrorism. We have supported the efforts of the international community to develop an inclusive political dialogue among all parties on the future of Libya as the only way to stop the conflict and resolve the Libyan crisis, which is a seriously threatening situation, and not only to its immediate neighbours.\nThe conflict between Israel and Palestine is still undermining peace and stability in the Middle East. A two-State solution will realistically enable both sides to fulfil their aspirations, put an end to the conflict and achieve a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians. We have always welcomed and supported the efforts of all sides and those of the international community to find a solution through negotiation.\nA few days ago, on behalf of Albania, I expressed, our full support for the principles and implementation of the declaration on the Global Call to Action on the\n \nWorld Drug Problem, initiated by the United States. We all need to take bold action and work together to eliminate drugs from the lives of our young people and children and save our societies and our national security and public health. For that reason, we must strengthen international cooperation and build a common basis  of understanding of the problem, including taking effective measures against it. In that context, I would also like to underline that Albania enjoys excellent cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\nAs a country with valuable contributions to the enforcement of peace, stability and progress, our respect for and strong desire to protect universal human rights and our strong faith in multilateralism, Albania seeks to serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period from 2022 to 2023. To that end, we stand ready to engage constructively in conflict prevention and various peace operations, both in the United Nations and in other regional security organizations, in order to implement sustainable development policies and contribute to universal respect for human rights. Albania is committed to protecting and promoting all human rights and supports the integration of the human rights dimension into the agenda of United Nations.\nFinally, I would like to address the issue of climate change, which affects every country and continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, at a high cost to peoples, communities and countries. The historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change of 2015, which is based on the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, provides a legally binding international commitment to engaging with concrete action. Albania has adopted corresponding strategies and action plans and is taking the necessary measures to protect the  environment and reduce gas emissions. It is quite clear that the consequences of climate change are moving faster than we are. We must prevent climate change in order to ensure the existence of the planet and save future generations. Collective efforts are needed to address collective challenges.\n"

        "file_text": "I join others in congratulating Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. She may rest assured that Indonesia will give her its full support for the success of her presidency. I also wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k on his success in guiding the Assembly at its seventy- second session.\nLet me also express our deepest sympathy and condolences on the passing of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The world has lost a great peacemaker and true humanist. We will always remember his legacy.\nThe world continues to face complex global challenges, where instabilities and conflicts are still rampant. Extreme poverty and inequalities linger. Zero-sum thinking and narrow nationalism often prevail. Furthermore, violations of human rights and democratic values remain day-to-day  problems  in our lives. at  times like these, we  often look  in vain  to leadership to show great strength, indeed to wield superhero-like powers.\nHowever, the world does not need to look for superheroes; we do not  need to call on  the strength  of the Avengers or that of the Justice League. We in this Hall are global leaders.  Collectively,  we  have  the strength of superheroes. What we must do now is harness our own individual wills, courage, strength, compassion, selflessness and humility. This is the very essence of the United Nations, where we all believe in the strength and power of the mantra contained in the\n \nCharter of the United Nations, \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d.\nAs global leaders \u2014 young and old, women and men \u2014 we  must work  together to encourage others  to achieve the goals and objectives of the United Nations. The theme of this year\u2019s general debate captures precisely what needs to be  done  by  all  of  us as a community of nations and a community of leaders. The message is loud and clear. Pursuing peace, equality and sustainability for our peoples requires global leadership and shared responsibility. There is no effective leadership without genuine responsibility and vice versa.\nThe first point I wish to make today  is  that  global leadership and responsibility will  determine the outcome of our quest for lasting peace. Peace is  not merely the absence of war. It is also a question of the commitment to peace. Our continuous efforts to maintain stability and prevent conflict must underpin our pursuit of happiness. But this must start with genuine leadership. It is at home, in our surroundings and in our respective regions, that we must start working to create ecosystems of peace, stability and prosperity. Indonesia will always believe in that way of thinking.\nWe cannot do so alone, which is why, as an elected non-permanent member of Security Council  next year, Indonesia will need the membership\u2019s continued support. We are grateful for the General Assembly\u2019s trust and confidence, and we will do our best to become its true partner for peace.\nFor the past five decades, we  have  enjoyed  a  long peace dividend in the Asia-Pacific region. Since geopolitical and geostrategic landscapes are changing so fast, Indonesia sees the opportunity to extend the peace dividend to the larger Indo-Pacific region. Along with other countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we are promoting an outlook that sees the Indian and Pacific regions as a single geostrategic theatre and a region of cooperation, not competition, with a view to supporting a greater global ecosystem of peace.\nThe commitment to and responsibility for peace must be replicated across all  regions,  including  in the Middle East. Central to peace and stability in the Middle East is the long-standing question of Palestine. If we cannot resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, our commitment to peace will be called into question. Setbacks persist as we speak in the form of the imminent\nthreat to the status quo of Jerusalem, the precarious lives of millions of Palestinian refugees that are at stake and the humanitarian situation, which is getting worse every day. Not only does the current situation harm the peace process, it destroys the hopes of the Palestinian people \u2014 the hopes of all of us \u2014 for an independent Palestinian State. The international community can no longer remain at a standstill on these issues. We must call for immediate negotiations that can make the two- State solution a reality. Indonesia will continue to stand with the people of Palestine until the day Palestine is truly independent.\nAt the global level, Indonesia is honoured to have contributed to United Nations peacekeeping. To date, Indonesia has contributed more than 3,500 personnel in nine United Nations missions and is the eighth-largest troop- and police-contributing country. We will not stop there. We are ready to contribute 4,000 peacekeepers by 2019, with an increasing proportion of female peacekeepers. Beyond numbers, we believe that United Nations peacekeeping operations should continue to be the Organization\u2019s flagship enterprise. But that can be achieved only if we strengthen its capacity to deliver on its mandate. That is why we have endorsed the Action for Peacekeeping declaration.\nI will begin my second point with a question: after peace has been achieved, will that peace be enough? Peace should not be seen as an end in and of itself. It must create an environment conducive to development. Peace and development must go hand  in  hand,  as they are mutually reinforcing. Only then can peace bring benefits to our peoples. It is for that reason that development goals and commitments have been agreed upon. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are but two obvious examples.\nAnother milestone was also reached in December, namely, the first-ever global instrument on migration, which was adopted in Marrakech. These agreements represent global leadership and a shared responsibility for a better future where no one is left behind. That applies to all countries, be they large or small, from the North or the South, developed or developing. In short, those agreements show our collective compassion and selflessness, which are the badges of global leadership at its finest. The next question is how we are going to live up to those commitments. The answer is that global leadership needs to create environments conducive to\n \nthe fulfilment of these commitments, which is very simple on paper but not so straightforward in practice.\nThree years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, many success stories have been told. However, results and progress may vary in various parts of the world. Lingering conflicts,  instability,  protectionism  and an uncertain global economic outlook continue to hamper our common efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Regrettably, time is not on our side. Some of us are running behind schedule in our efforts to hit the SDG targets. To overcome that fact, the pace of implementation must be accelerated. Decisive actions must be taken to improve access to financing, capacity-building and technology. Global leadership and partnership must be pursued in future to achieve win-win solutions.\nAs part of our global leadership and responsibility, Indonesia has taken concrete steps to implement its commitments. Through South-South and triangular cooperation, Indonesia has offered more than 500 capacity-building programmes to more than 6,000 participants across the globe, from Asia to Africa, from the South Pacific to the Caribbean. We will soon launch the Indonesia Aid for Development programme to reinforce the delivery of our international assistance. Moreover, earlier this year, Indonesia hosted the first- ever Indonesia-Africa Forum, which is a testament to our strong commitment to promote win-win cooperation with the African continent. Furthermore, as a follow- up, we will convene an Indonesia-Africa Infrastructure Dialogue next year, which will focus on infrastructure, in order to accelerate development in Africa.\nAs the largest archipelagic country in the world, we are fully aware of the adverse impact of climate change, as the countries that have to face this issue most acutely have been the small island developing States. We are convening an archipelagic and island States conference at the margins of the Our Ocean Conference next month as proof of our firm leadership and commitment to addressing this matter.\nPeace and development can be sustained only if we have an equitable society, which leads me to my third point today: the importance of creating a society that is just, inclusive, democratic and respectful of human rights. An equitable, tolerant, and moderate society is key to addressing the major challenges of violent extremism and radicalism. Injustice, exclusiveness, extreme poverty, illiteracy and massive youth unemployment\nmust be eliminated. Hard- and soft-power approaches must be improved. For that reason, we have amended our national law and strengthened our soft approach in order to adapt to new evolving challenges. The recent horrific terrorist attack in Surabaya, Indonesia, showed that the use of violence by terrorists knows no bounds. Using children as weapons can never be right. But that attack will only strengthen our determination to work more closely with the international community.\nIn order to create peaceful, sustainable and equitable societies, all countries must respect international law and the principles of  the United Nations, including  the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries. In that regard, Indonesia strongly deplores the attempts of one country to support or, even worse, become part of separatist movements. Such acts of hostility have no place in the United Nations system, especially since they are acts in clear violation of United Nations principles. Indonesia has long chosen to build friendly relations with that particular country, including in showing our solidarity and sympathy during difficult times. But when such hostile acts continue, Indonesia will not remain silent. Indonesia will not let any country undermine its territorial integrity. Like any other sovereign country, Indonesia will firmly defend its territorial integrity. I repeat: Indonesia will firmly defend its territorial integrity.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies require a more responsive, responsible and credible United Nations. We at the United Nations must show  leadership,  which is why United Nations reform is unavoidable. Otherwise, the United Nations will become obsolete and unable to respond to the needs and challenges of today and tomorrow.\nThe goal of the United Nations reform is crystal-clear. The Organization needs to be better positioned to help countries sustain peace and achieve the SDGs. Each one of us has a role to play in keeping the United Nations relevant and in ensuring that the United Nations delivers. Indonesia stands ready to contribute to that noble goal for the sake of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on her recent election to her important post.\nThe men, women and children of every continent in the world throughout our shared home, planet Earth, hope that our deliberations will bring concrete improvements to their lives. The world sees its leaders meet once a year and continues to hope that we will collaborate in complying fully with our mandate to build a more just society for all. When the United Nations was created, after the Second World War, it established clear purposes that now serve as a measure of our triumphs, failures, threats and opportunities. We sought to maintain international peace, security and justice, prevent and eliminate threats and suppress acts of aggression. We sought to resolve our disagreements by peaceful means and to foster friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples.\nThe theme of the general debate this year \u2014 \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d \u2014 allows me to cite a practical provision of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which is that Member States\n\u201cshall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered\u201d.\nI am referring here to the  proceedings that  Bolivia has brought before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, whose decision will be  announced  next week. The  case  deals  with  Chile\u2019s  obligation to negotiate with Bolivia in an effective and timely manner on sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. It tests the shared responsibility of two States to agree on just solutions within the framework of international\n \nlaw. The Court asserted its jurisdiction to hear and resolve that international disagreement in 2015,  whose hemispheric interest was recognized by the Organization of American States because it involves two neighbours and undermines efforts  to  achieve the regional integration of peoples. Bolivia\u2019s goal is the good-faith achievement, together with Chile, of a durable, sustainable and mutually satisfactory solution to a 100-year conflict that has put two neighbouring countries at odds.\nIts worst consequence  is  that  Bolivia  has  been a landlocked country, with its people and the State deprived of access to the Pacific Ocean, a state of affairs that has severely affected our human and economic development and continues to do so. Bolivia\u2019s maritime suit is related to its understanding of diplomacy as working for the people, their life and their right to access to the sea and its vast resources, the largest setting for life on the planet and the shared heritage of humankind and its peoples. Human beings are supported by the sea. Life on Earth is not possible without water, and it is  not possible to think about the lives of people without access to the sea. Not only is it a door to trade, markets and modern transactions, it is also a window on other peoples and on life itself.\nWe hope that the legal proceedings that have been brought before the International Court of Justice will be recognized and will help to bring the parties closer to the start of productive negotiations. We also hope that to the extent possible, with the support of the international community, it will help us to reach a genuine agreement that honestly outlines the causes and effects of the conflict that has driven us apart for more than a century. The agreement should also critically examine the inadequacy of the agreements and attempts to overcome Bolivia\u2019s landlocked status, while validating and illustrating the reciprocal advantages of timely and effective agreements in the context of the principles  of regional and global integration and reconciling two peoples engaged in an absurd conflict, often for reasons that are alien to their values of brotherly coexistence.\nThe conflict between Bolivia and Chile over access to the Pacific Ocean is not the result of a recent or passing political or electoral issue. It goes back to the very origins of our territorial dispute at the end of the nineteenth century, when the interests of foreign corporations seeking to exploit the natural resources of the Atacama area, such as guano, potassium nitrate, silver and copper, launched a hostile, asymmetric and\nexpansionist campaign in the region. The landlocked status imposed on Bolivia could not be remedied through treaties that proved insufficient or through attempted agreements and failed commitments.\nThe Bolivian people\u2019s ongoing claim is more than a century old, both at the regional level and in multilateral organizations. Bolivia is certain that whatever the International Court of Justice decides, it will mark a new era in the relationship between Bolivia and Chile so that we  can face the future with righteousness and a determination to explore mutually acceptable and lasting solutions. Our peoples and their leaders must unite their desire for peace and their political will in a single voice if they are to identify feasible, functional solutions that make them feel that they have won rather than lost. Practical solutions, forged by creative and effective diplomacy, have been found to even the oldest and most complex controversies in the world.\nThe Governments and the  peoples  of  Bolivia and Chile must wait patiently for a  legal  decision  that, beyond its formal  aspects,  can  open  the  door to a new era of peace, justice and brotherhood. Such an opportunity deserves the attention of the States Members of the United Nations, since the decision of the Organization\u2019s main legal body to assume jurisdiction over, hear and adjudicate a dispute, and, in this case, to suggest parameters for a  possible  solution,  will  set a precedent for fairer societies that are willing to share the responsibility for resolving their differences. That would be a contrast to the past, when domination by winning wars was all that counted. That is the significance of our case in the context of the theme of the seventy-third session of the General Assembly.\nWe have frequently warned the Assembly about the many crises facing humankind and life as a whole on our planet. Unfortunately, every year we attend this event to confirm that,  despite  many  praiseworthy  efforts, a number of those crises have not only continued but worsened. I want to take this opportunity to talk about the three biggest threats we face. The first is climate change. Every year is warmer than the one before. Every year more severe weather events occur. Every year more people and other living creatures are irreversibly affected by hurricanes, floods, droughts and pollution. While we consider global efforts such as the Paris Agreement important, if we do not tackle the underlying structural causes of climate change, we will not be able to stop it, all the more so when the biggest polluter in the history of humankind, the United States,\n \nturns its back on science, multilateralism and thereby on humankind. Climate change is an inseparable consequence of capitalism, overproduction and patterns of consumption. The planet is exhausted and so is life along with it.\nThe second major threat is the arms race, the culture of war and the possibility of a nuclear disaster. Many leaders of countries, especially those that have the most weapons, come to this forum to talk about peace. Military spending is growing, with an increase of 1.1 per cent in 2017 over spending in 2016, and has now reached the extraordinary sum of $1.739 trillion, or\n2.2 per cent of the global gross domestic product. The world cannot live at the expense of those who believe that they have the right to produce and use weapons capable of totally destroying life on our planet. In addition, the arms industry feeds off war, and as its weapons are proved to be effective at killing children, the value of their shares increases in the stock market. That criminal logic must end. That threat also comes at the hand of those who are willing to invade countries and change Governments in order to expropriate their peoples\u2019 natural resources. They install military bases with the aim of controlling the entire planet.\nThe third great threat is inequality. Every year our wealth is concentrated in fewer hands. In 2017, 82 per cent of the world\u2019s increase in wealth ended up in the hands of the richest 1 per cent of the population, while half of humankind saw no increase at  all. According to data from Credit Suisse, 42 people are now worth the same as 3.7 billion others taken all  together.  Those figures are shameful, and we should all be ashamed, because they represent a model of wealth accumulation and poverty distribution rather than one of wealth distribution.\nBolivia condemns in the clearest and strongest terms the illegal, inhuman and criminal economic and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States. The United States has the obligation to make financial reparations for the damage done to the heroic Cuban people and should comply with the relevant General Assembly resolutions by immediately lifting the blockade. It should also restore Guantanamo to Cuban sovereignty and refrain from any interference or intervention in its internal affairs.\nFrom our seat on the Security Council, we have closely followed the progress and difficulties in the implementation of the peace agreement signed between\nthe Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo. We are hopeful that the new Government of Colombia will promote the processes for the social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants and will protect the lives of human rights defenders and community leaders, thereby once again affirming that Latin America and the Caribbean is a zone of peace.\nOur brother country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is suffering shameless aggression at the hands of the United States and its allies. Latin America firmly rejects any attempts to intervene militarily in Venezuela. Venezuelan issues must be solved by the Venezuelans, and the United States  must  abandon  the illegal and unilateral measures that are one of the causes of Venezuela\u2019s economic problems.\nWe also want to take this opportunity to condemn the criminal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the United States Government\u2019s unilateral and illegal decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel, which jeopardizes any possibility of reaching a just and lasting peace. We also reiterate our support for a two- State solution, with a free, independent and sovereign Palestinian State based on the pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nWe deeply regret the fact that the war  in Syria  has caused more than half a million  deaths  in  the past eight years, a consequence of policies of regime change, interference in internal affairs and efforts to expropriate natural resources. Bolivia repudiates the violations of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity directly or indirectly perpetrated by different States, including the United States, and we hope that the efforts of the United Nations to reach a political agreement by and for the Syrians will soon bear fruit. We welcome the efforts of Russia, Iran, Turkey and Kazakhstan to prevent any more suffering by the Syrian people.\nIn conclusion, it is my duty to inform the Assembly about the situation in Bolivia. As is well known, we have liberated ourselves from the bonds of United States military bases, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Agency for International Development, and from the demands of the International Monetary Fund as well as other types of taxation. Bolivia is now an example to the region and the world. We have one of the fastest-growing economies in the region. In the past decade we have reduced\n \nextreme poverty from 37 per cent to 17 per cent. We have increased life expectancy by eight years, lowered infant mortality by 56 per cent and reduced chronic child malnutrition by 50 per cent. Bolivia invests more money than any other country in the world in renewable energies in relation to gross domestic product. We are building a more just society. We also want to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that, as part of an initiative to fight corruption, our President and Vice President have renounced bank secrecy. We call on all Heads of State to pursue such a measure with a view to governing as transparently as possible.\nThose achievements have been made possible thanks to the unity of the Bolivian people, the defence of our sovereignty, the recovery of our natural resources and strategic enterprises, the pluralistic economic model and the redistribution of wealth. We reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism. It is imperative that we work together to build a society with equal opportunities for all. We must take care of this planet, our only home. We must make this a world where justice is possible and peace a reality.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, it is indeed a great honour for me to address the Assembly on behalf of the Republic of Serbia. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on the assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I wish to assure the President that Serbia is deeply committed to advancing, in practice, the topics on this session\u2019s agenda, namely, peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. Having said that, I must also say that it is indeed a pleasure to see that a fellow stateswoman is presiding over this important institution.\nMy congratulations are also due to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his stewardship of the General Assembly at its  seventy-second  session,  as  well  as to His Excellency Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary- General, for his engagement and commitment to promoting important reform processes within the United Nations system.\nI would not be saying anything new or original if  I were to say that the world of today \u2014 be it Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa or Australia \u2014 faces significant and increasing challenges. We are already feeling the grave consequences of climate change, migration and terrorism, the rise of populism and the divisions between us at a time when we need greater convergence. We have all heard that throughout our discussions and from more than one leader during the General Assembly debate.\nI will, however, say this. In looking for our way out of this troubled situation and in striving to build a better world for all of us, we all need to start with ourselves and the things we must do ourselves, first and foremost as individuals, then in our countries, in our regions, in our continents and then in the united world that we are. We must once again start bringing the nations of the world together, as we did 70 or so years ago.\nSerbia is on the way to rethinking itself as a prosperous, dynamic, creative, innovative, open society within a united Europe that is whole, free and at peace. I am often asked \u2014 when others are leaving European Union (EU), when so many express doubts regarding the prospect of a united Europe \u2014 why would joining the EU be the principal strategic goal?\nI have  often asked myself  the same thing. In life, I believe that when we are not sure of the answer, we must go back to basics, clear our heads of the daily clutter, forget political misconceptions and spins, and think of basic values. That, I believe, is where we find our answers. The basic value of the European Union, much like the basic value of the United Nations, is peace. It is not the economy, nor trade, nor a bigger\n \nmarket. It is peace. All of the other things and much, much more came, and will always come, as a spill-over effect of peace.\nThe European Union was a peace project, and it is a successful one. We want and we need to be part of  it, so that there is sustainable peace and, consequently, stability and prosperity in the Balkans \u2014 that troubled region of the world that used to be known as the \u201cpowder keg\u201d of Europe.\nI am extremely proud of what Serbia has been  able to achieve in the past four years. We have built macroeconomic stability and proved ourselves to be a responsible and reliable partner. Our economic activity has intensified, unemployment has more than halved compared to just four years ago, and we are seeing speedy recovery. Today, Serbia is one of the countries experiencing the highest economic growth in Europe, characterized by a substantial and ever-greater influx of foreign investment.\nWe have embarked on a comprehensive public administration reform with one simple goal: greater focus on citizens. We remind our Administration \u2014 all of us \u2014 on a daily basis that we are there to serve, not to be served. We are also working on strengthening the rule of law through judicial reforms, working with the media, establishing honest dialogue with civil-society organizations, building institutions to fight organized crime and corruption and ensuring fairness and justice for all. What we are doing is not easy, and I must say that we are far from always being successful, but it is a path to which we are fully committed.\nWhen talking about things that are not easy to deal with, but for which one needs to take responsibility in order to build peace and prosperity in one\u2019s region, one\u2019s continent and one\u2019s world, I cannot emphasize enough how important regional cooperation and stability is  for Serbia. Here, we are talking about a region which has never, ever  been stable or very predictable. Nor  is it a part of the world known for peace, reason and pragmatism \u2014 on the contrary. We have always been known for \u2014 but have always been proud of \u2014 our excessive emotions, sacrifices, poetic struggles and traditional animosities.\nToday, Serbia is trying very hard to leave that behind and grow and become more reasonable, instead of more emotional; more pragmatic, instead of immersed in myths, a country that is proud of its victories, not  of its losses, and a country that is building unexpected friendships in place of traditional animosities. I am proud to say that our President led the way in this internal struggle of ours to grow and mature, to leave the past behind and turn towards a very different future.\nFirst and foremost, I  will address here the issue of our Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, which split even the United Nations down the middle. Fewer than half of States Members of the United Nations have recognized the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo, while more than half \u2014 that is, more than 5 billion people across the world \u2014 refuse to recognize the illegal secession of Kosovo.\nWhat Serbia has been trying to do in the past year is essentially to close Pandora\u2019s box, not reopen it, following the events of 10 years ago when the unilateral declaration of independence was proclaimed by the authorities in Pristina. A number of countries in the world rushed to recognize that unilateral declaration of independence, regardless of international law and standards, regardless of the fact that the declaration was issued only four years after Serbian churches and monasteries \u2014 I remind the Assembly that these are World Heritage sites \u2014 were looted and burned, and regardless of the fact that the international community has always stated \u201cstandards before status\u201d as their mantra. When everyone saw that standards were not on Pristina\u2019s agenda, they decided to break their own mantra and simply decide on its status.\nToday\u2019s Serbia is committed to peace and, if  I may say so, to behaving like an adult. We signed the Brussels Agreement more than five years ago and we have implemented it. Pristina signed it but, even five years on, has still not implemented a single word. We will continue insisting on the full implementation of the Brussels Agreement and the establishment of the Community of Serbian Municipalities, but we will remain tolerant and patient.\nHowever difficult, challenging and sometimes hopeless and wasteful the dialogue with Pristina might be, we will stay committed to finding a compromise that will ensure sustainable peace, prosperity and a brighter future for all people in the region. Serbia will continue demonstrating its readiness to compromise, which is far from easy in that we need a counterpart that is politically bold, responsible, committed and trustworthy. That\n \nhas not been the case so far. I am therefore asking the international community to continue supporting the efforts that Serbia has initiated. To achieve progress  in the dialogue, we need the undiluted and consistent support of the international community.\nSerbia is committed to working with other nations across the globe to take our common destiny, as many at the United Nations refer to it, into our own hands. We want to claim our accountability towards future generations. We want them to hold us accountable. That is why we are investing so much in peace, understanding and reconciliation in the region. On the other hand, we are equally investing in the future. The key priorities of my Government are youth and education. We need to start teaching our youth how to think, not what to think.\nAll of us, not just Serbia, need to start investing more than ever before in education to create more innovative, braver, freer-thinking individuals who  will then, in turn, create a world that is freer, fairer, and \u2014 to be honest \u2014 much  more  fun. The world will value people for who they are and for the values and beliefs they stand for, rather than for where they are from, the colour of their skin or whom they love. Serbia is very fortunate because we have a lot of people \u2014 especially young people \u2014 who are amongst the best in the world at creative  thinking,  video- game design, genome research, digital agriculture, animation, physics, machine engineering, mathematics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, biology, software development and programming.\nOur absolutely key priority is to support them and to make sure that we create a system and institutions able to ensure that more of them can realize their full potential. Not only will that be the basis for the future growth of Serbia, but, perhaps more importantly, we hope to be able to empower them so that they will, together with others from all over the world, build a better world for all of us. Without any doubt, our future is digital. As Secretary-General Guterres said at the opening of the general debate, \u201ctechnology is our ally\u201d (A/73/PV.6, p. 3).\nI believe that Serbia, although  small,  can  and will play an important role in digital development in the future. That will help us deal with climate change, by far the biggest challenge ahead of us. We must also alleviate hunger by increasing efficiency and by making agriculture smarter, and reduce poverty by ensuring\neasy access to finance, even for the poorest and most disadvantaged \u2014 those whom we cannot leave behind.\nThis is how Serbia sees its path towards more peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies in our world. This is us \u2014 Serbia \u2014doing our bit for  a  better world.\n"

        "file_text": "On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the Republic of Equatorial  Guinea\u2019s  independence,  on 12 October, I would like to extend a greeting of peace and freedom to all the nations of the world as an expression of the gratitude of the people of Equatorial Guinea for the most resounding success of the United Nations since its creation in 1945, the liberation of all colonized peoples. Indeed, the well-being of humankind, a fundamental objective of the United Nations, could not be achieved if the freedom and dignity of peoples and nations were constrained by the subjugation of some peoples by others through the colonial system. For that reason, my delegation would like to to once again raise its voice in this global setting to call for the end of strongholds of colonialism, wherever they may be and whatever form they take.\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea wholeheartedly congratulates Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, as a reflection of both the gender equality the Organization seeks to uphold and the political pragmatism of her country, the Republic of Ecuador, in its scrupulous respect for the purposes and principles of the United\nNations. We believe that under her leadership the United Nations will achieve the successes it desires.\nWe also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, the outgoing President, on his indisputable successes and outstanding work in leading the General Assembly at its  seventy-second  session.  By  the same token, the work of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, deserves our praise for the dynamism with which he has been leading all the bodies of the United Nations with a view to making them less bureaucratic and bringing their efforts closer to Member States.\nThe topics selected for discussion during this session represent the greatest concerns of the international community. Economically speaking, despite the numerous resolutions and recommendations adopted by the United Nations for promoting nations\u2019 sustainable growth and economic development, an insurmountable gap between developed and developing countries continues making it more difficult to maintain peace and stability in poor countries. That compels us to set aside our ambitions and pride and support the achievement of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 with all the means available to us.\nA supposedly globalized world in which imbalance, marginalization and instability reign would be difficult on every front, political, economic, social and moral. In that regard, the current problems of mass and uncontrolled immigration of populations from South to North, the internal instabilities of developing countries and rebel and terrorist movements throughout the world are clear reactions to the problems of poverty and underdevelopment suffered by developing countries as a result of behaviour that shows injustice and a  lack  of solidarity. We cannot guarantee international peace and security while those pockets of violence remain, jeopardizing the lives of populations.\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, as a non-permanent member of the Security  Council,  will always support and give priority to preventive diplomacy to avoid conflicts and foster dialogue, agreements, negotiation and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Above all, we ask for scrupulous observance of the principles of international law, particularly with regard to respect for the independence and sovereignty of each State, non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations, every country\u2019s right to use its own\n \nnatural resources and the promotion of fair and equitable cooperation with reciprocal benefits among States.\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea also praises and commends the peace processes undertaken \u2014 through dialogue, compromise and tolerance among the  parties \u2014 between the Federal Republic of Ethiopia and Somalia, and between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America with respect to the Korean peninsula. Equatorial Guinea calls for similar resolutions of other conflicts in the world, such as those in Djibouti, Somalia, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, Yemen, the Middle East, Libya, South Sudan, Central Africa, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea-Bissau.\nFor Equatorial Guinea, coercive decisions such as Security Council sanctions have never resolved any conflict in the history of the United Nations. Neither have armed interventions resolved substantive issues. On the contrary, they are opposed to the principles of State independence and sovereignty that endow States with responsibilities. We therefore insist on the value of negotiation as a political and moral tool that is capable of satisfying the parties to a conflict. Contrary to their claims, obligatory condemnations trigger defensive behaviour from the State in question, whether out of pride or in self-defence. Worst of all, such decisions usually result in depriving the affected peoples of their most fundamental rights.\nAs a matter of international justice, Equatorial Guinea believes in the need to reform the Security Council to make it more democratic, representative and capable of guaranteeing the interests that shape the current global framework. The Council\u2019s structure, adopted in 1945, is obsolete, since our world is no longer governed by the political criteria of  the time.  In that regard, the African continent is the future of humankind today and should not remain marginalized from major decisions that may affect the whole world. The Security Council, which is partly to blame for Africa\u2019s marginalization, must also feel responsible for the recent conflicts in the Sahel region and the ongoing unbridled immigration from Africa to Europe.\nWith regard to my country\u2019s domestic development, despite the significant oil crisis affecting Equatorial Guinea, socioeconomic development is evolving positively, thanks to the prevailing  peace. We can therefore expect to see the country recover\neconomically relatively soon. And our transition programme towards a multiparty system, initiated in 1992, has been characterized by an inclusive democratic openness and permanent dialogue open to all. In its first year we recognized 14 political parties, a number that has now risen to 18 in a country with fewer than\n1.5 million inhabitants.\nOver that period we have held six rounds of inclusive dialogue with opposition political parties, which has resulted not only in the recognition of new political parties, but has  also  produced  reform  of  the Constitution and of other laws regulating public freedoms. As a result, Heads of State are now limited to two successive terms, whereas before they could hold office indefinitely. Several control bodies for managing public affairs have also been created.\nThe socioeconomic development plan adopted following our second national economic conference,  in 2000, envisaged economic recovery by 2020. Its most significant results have been the construction of basic economic infrastructure such as roads, ports, airports, environmental sanitation facilities, modern hospitals, vocational and university training centres, drinking water systems, telecommunications and power infrastructure and, more recently, the transformation of densely populated rural hubs throughout the country into small modern cities.\nHuman capacity-building has achieved such levels that citizens are able to responsibly manage national development, which   has   created   an   atmosphere of trust between national political forces and the people, who feel empowered to realize their own objectives. In its the effects of the economic crisis, the Government is planning a third phase of the national economic conference with a view to purposefully spearheading the socioeconomic development plan initially set for 2020. We call for the cooperation of friendly countries and for multilateral assistance to support the Government\u2019s efforts, which are currently geared to the diversification of production sources, industrialization and the development of the national economy\u2019s production sector, as well as capitalizing on existing infrastructure.\nThe United Nations should serve as a forum for cooperative exchanges that promote the development of humankind as well as a forum for dialogue.\nFinally, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea believes that the United Nations is the highest body of\n \nmultilateral diplomacy within which, if we all adhere equally to the general principles of international law, we can not only guarantee world peace and stability but also build more developed societies that guarantee the rights of all the peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate you, Madam President, and your country, Ecuador, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. I wish you every success. I would also like to thank your predecessor for his role in steering the work of the Assembly during the previous session. I thank as well the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his efforts pursuant to the Charter.\nEvery year we come to this important international forum carrying hopes and wishes that every place in this world will have become more secure, stable and prosperous. Today, our hope is greater than ever, as we are confident that the will of the people will eventually triumph. Our hope and confidence are the result of more\n \nthan seven years of hardship during which our people have suffered from the scourge of terrorism. However, Syrians have refused to compromise and succumb to terrorist groups and their external supporters. They have stood their ground and remained defiant, fully convinced that their struggle is a battle for their existence, their history and their future, from which they will ultimately emerge victorious.\nTo the disappointment of some, we are here today, more than seven years into the dirty war against my country, to announce to the world that the situation on the ground has become more secure and stable, and that our battle against terrorism is almost over. That  is true thanks to the heroism, resolve and unity of the Syrian people and the army, and to the support of our allies and friends. Despite those achievements, we are determined to continue the sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories of terrorist groups, regardless of their names, and any illegal foreign presence. We will pay no heed to any aggression or external pressure on us, or to any lies or allegations that seek to discourage us. That is our duty and a non-negotiable right that we have exercised as we eradicated terrorism from most of the Syrian territories.\nThe Governments of certain countries have denied us our right under international law and our national duty to combat terrorism and protect our people on  our land and within our own borders. At the same time, those Governments have founded an illegitimate international coalition led by the United States under the pretext of combating terrorism in Syria. However, that coalition has done everything but fight terrorism. It has even proved that the coalition\u2019s goals were in line with those of terrorist groups, namely, spreading chaos, killing and destruction. The coalition destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa,  destroyed  infrastructure and public services in targeted areas and massacred civilians, including children and women, all of which constitute war crimes under international law.\nOn the other hand, the coalition has provided direct military support to terrorists on multiple occasions as they fought against the Syrian army. It should have been more aptly named the coalition to support terrorists and commit war crimes.\nThe situation and its dimensions in Syria cannot be divorced from the conflict raging between  two axes on the world stage. One axis promotes peace, stability and prosperity across the world, advocates\nfor a culture of dialogue and mutual understanding, respects international law and upholds the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. The other axis tries to spread chaos in international relations and insists on employing colonization and hegemony as tools to further its  narrow  interests, even if that means resorting to dirty methods such as supporting terrorism and imposing economic blockades in order to subjugate peoples and Governments that reject external dictates and insist on making their own independent national decisions.\nWhat happened in Syria should have been a lesson to those countries, but they refuse to learn. That  is why we, the Members of this Organization, must make clear and unequivocal choices. Are we going to defend international law and the Charter of the United Nations and be on the side of justice? Or are we going to succumb to hegemonic tendencies and the law of the jungle that some are trying to impose on this Organization and the world?\nToday, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism. The Syrian Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists and restore normal life. All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods. It is true that thousands of Syrian refugees living abroad have started to return home. From this rostrum, I would like to stress that the return of each and every Syrian refugee is a priority for the Syrian State. Doors are wide open for all Syrians abroad to return voluntarily and safely. I underline that what applies to Syrians inside Syria also applies to Syrians abroad. Everyone is under the law.\nThanks to the help from the Government of the Russian Federation, the Syrian Government will spare no effort to facilitate the return of those refugees and meet their basic needs. Therefore, a special coordination body has been established  to  coordinate  the  return of refugees to their places of origin in Syria and to enable them to rebuild their normal lives. Although  we have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of refugees, some Western countries \u2014 as a complement to the dirty role  they have  played since the start of  the war in Syria \u2014 continue to  obstruct the  return   of those Syrian refugees to their country. They are\n \nspreading fears among refugees under false pretexts and politicizing that purely humanitarian issue, using it as a bargaining chip to serve their political agenda and linking the return of refugees to the political process.\nToday, as we are about to close the last chapter of the Syrian crisis, Syrians are determined to come together, erase the traces of that terrorist war and rebuild their country with their own hands and experience. That applies to those who stayed in Syria and to those who were forced to leave as a result of terrorist acts. We welcome all of the initiatives of States and parties that did not engage in the aggression against Syria and were clear and explicit in rejecting terrorism to help the Syrian Government in the reconstruction process. We underscore once again that the friendly countries that stood by our side against terrorism have priority in participating in the reconstruction programmes. As for the countries that offer only conditional assistance to engage in the reconstruction process or continue to support terrorism, they are basically neither invited nor welcome.\nIn parallel with achieving progress against terrorism, as well as in reconstruction and the return of refugees, we are keen to advance the political process while maintaining our constant principles, namely, to preserve the sovereignty, independence and unity of the territory and people of the Syrian Arab Republic. The Syrian people have the exclusive right to determine the future of their country without any external interference and free of terrorism in the Syrian territories.\nBased on those constant principles, we have expressed time and again our readiness to respond to any initiative that could help Syrians to end the crisis. We have engaged positively and openly in the Geneva talks, the Astana process and the intra-Syrian national dialogue in Sochi. However, it has always been the other parties that have set obstacles, rejected dialogue and resorted to terrorism and foreign interference.\nNevertheless, we continue to adopt a positive attitude towards the outcomes of the Syrian national dialogue in Sochi on the formation of a committee to review the current constitution. We have presented a practical and comprehensive vision on the composition, prerogatives and working methods of that committee, and submitted a list of representatives on  behalf of  the Syrian State. We stress that the mandate of the committee is limited to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution through a Syrian-led and Syrian-\nowned process that may be facilitated by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria.\nWe also stress that no preconditions or foregone conclusions should be imposed on  the  committee  and its recommendations. The committee must be independent, given that the Constitution and anything relating to it is a Syrian matter to be decided by Syrians themselves. We will not, therefore, accept any proposal that constitutes interference in the internal affairs of Syria or might lead to such  interference.  We underscore that the Syrian people must have the final word regarding any constitutional or other matter relating to sovereignty. We also reaffirm our readiness to work actively with countries friendly to the Syrian Government to launch the work of the committee along the bases and parameters that I have just mentioned.\nIn conjunction with the international initiatives that I have referred to, local national reconciliation is well under way. Reconciliation agreements have stopped the bloodshed and prevented destruction in many Syrian areas. They have restored stability and normal life to those areas, allowing their people to return to the homes that they were forced to leave because of terrorism. Reconciliation will therefore remain our priority and our focus.\nThe battle we have fought in Syria against terrorism has not only been a military one; it has also been a battle between the culture of destruction, extremism and death and the culture of construction, tolerance and life. I therefore appeal from this rostrum to the international community to fight the ideology of terrorism and violent extremism and prevent it from getting support and financial resources, and to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions, notably resolution 2253 (2015). The military battle against terrorism, while important, is not enough. Terrorism is like an epidemic: it will return, break out and threaten everyone without exception.\nWe fully condemn and reject the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, wherever or whenever it occurs and regardless of the target. That  is why Syria completely eliminated its chemical programme and fulfilled all its commitments to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), as confirmed by numerous OPCW reports.\n \nAlthough some Western countries are constantly trying to politicize that organization\u2019s work, we have always cooperated with the OPCW to the fullest  extent possible. Unfortunately, every time we express our readiness to receive objective and professional investigative teams to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons, those countries have blocked such efforts because they know that the conclusions of the investigations would not satisfy them given the ill intentions they harbour against Syria. Those countries have ready-made accusations and scenarios to justify aggression against Syria. That was the case when the United States, France and Britain launched a wanton tripartite aggression on Syria last April, claiming that chemical weapons had been used, but without any investigation or evidence and in flagrant violation of Syria\u2019s sovereignty, international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nMeanwhile, those same countries have disregarded all of the reliable information that we have  provided on chemical weapons in the possession of terrorist groups that were used by them on multiple occasions with a view to casting blame on the Syrian Government and justifying a predetermined attack against it. The terrorist organization known as the White Helmets was the main tool used to mislead public opinion, fabricate accusations and come up with lies regarding the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The White Helmets organization was created by British intelligence under a humanitarian cover. It has been proved, however, that that organization is part of the Al-Nusra Front, which is affiliated with Al-Qaida. Despite all those allegations, we remain determined to liberate every inch of our territory without concern for the black banners of terrorists or the theatrics of the White Helmets.\nIn another episode of the terrorist war on Syria since 2011, brutal suicide bombings in July orchestrated by Da\u2019esh rocked the province of Al-Suwayda in southern Syria. It is worth noting that the terrorists behind that attack came from the Al-Tanf area, where United States forces are present. That area has become a safe haven for remnant groups of Da\u2019esh gunmen, who are now hiding in the Rukban refugee camp on the border with Jordan under the protection and sponsorship of United States forces present in the area. In line with its investment in terrorism aimed at prolonging the crisis in Syria, the United States has also sought to release terrorists from Guantanamo prison and send them to Syria, where they\nhave become the effective leaders of the Al-Nusra Front\nand other terrorist groups.\nMeanwhile, the Turkish regime continues to support terrorists in Syria. Since day one of the  war on Syria, the Turkish regime has trained and armed terrorists, turning Turkey into a hub and a corridor for terrorists on their way to Syria. When those terrorists failed to serve its agenda, the Turkish regime resorted to direct aggression by attacking many cities and towns in northern Syria. However, all actions that seek to undermine Syria\u2019s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and that violate international law will not stop us from exercising our right and duty to recover all our land and purge it of terrorists, whether through military action or local reconciliation agreements.\nBased on the aforementioned, we have always welcomed any initiative that prevents further Syrian bloodshed and restores security and safety to areas affected by terrorism. That is why we welcomed the agreement on Idlib reached in Sochi on 17 September. That agreement was the result of intensive consultations and full coordination  between  Syria  and  Russia. We underscore that that  agreement  is  time-bound and includes specific deadlines. It complements the agreements previously reached in Astana on the de-escalation zones. We hope that, when the agreement is implemented, the Al-Nusra Front and other terrorist groups will be eradicated, thereby eliminating the last remnants of terrorism on the Syrian territories.\nAny foreign presence on Syrian territories without the consent of the Syrian Government is illegal and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. It is an assault on our national sovereignty and undermines counter-terrorism efforts and threatens  regional peace  and  security. We therefore consider that any forces operating on Syrian territories without a request from the Syrian Government  \u2014  including  United  States,  French and Turkish forces \u2014 are occupying forces,  which will be dealt with accordingly. They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally.\nIsrael continues to occupy a cherished part of our land in the Syrian Golan, and our people there continue to suffer because of Israel\u2019s oppressive and aggressive policies. Israel has even supported terrorist groups that have operated in southern Syria, protecting them through direct military intervention and launching repeated attacks on Syrian land. However, just as\n \nwe liberated southern Syria from terrorists, we are determined to fully restore the occupied Syrian Golan along the lines of 4 June 1967. Syria demands that the international community effectively put an end to all such Israeli practices and compel Israel to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions, notably resolution 497 (1981), on the occupied Syrian Golan.\nThe international community must also help the Palestinian people to establish their own independent State, with Jerusalem as its capital, and facilitate the return of Palestinian refugees to their land, pursuant to resolutions of international legitimacy. Any actions that undermine those rights are null and void and can only be rejected, as they threaten regional peace and security, especially the racist Israeli law  known  as the Nation-State Law and the decision of the United States Administration to move the American embassy to Jerusalem and to stop funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\nSyria strongly condemns the decision of the United States Administration to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran, which proves once again that Administration\u2019s disregard for and  non-commitment to international treaties and conventions. We reiterate our full solidarity with the leaders and the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and trust that they will overcome the effects of that irresponsible decision on the part of the United States Administration.\nIn the same context, we also stand with the Government and the people of Venezuela against the attempts by the United States to interfere in their internal affairs. We call once again for the lifting of the unilateral economic measures imposed on the Syrian people and all other independent peoples around the world, especially those of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Cuba and Belarus.\nIn conclusion, I would like everyone to know that Syria, with the help of its allies and friends, will defeat terrorism. We must be treated accordingly. It is high time for some people to detach themselves from their state of separation from reality, abandon their illusions and come to understand that they will not achieve politically what they failed to achieve by war. We have never compromised on our national principles, even when the war was at its peak. We will surely not do so today.\nAt the same time, we want peace for the peoples of the world \u2014 that is the message we are sending \u2014 because we want peace for our people. We have never attacked others; we have never interfered in the affairs of others; and we have never exported terrorism to other parts  of the world. We have always maintained the best relations with other countries. Today, as we seek to defeat terrorism, we continue to advocate dialogue and understanding, which serves the interests of our people and helps to achieve security, stability and prosperity for all."

        "file_text": "The statements delivered during this session\u2019s general debate confirm that international relations are now being conducted in a complex and controversial period of history.\nToday, we are all witnessing two opposing trends collide. On the one hand, we  see the strengthening    of polycentric principles of world order, the steady development of new centres of economic growth and peoples\u2019 aspirations to preserve their sovereignty and choose development models that are consistent with their national, cultural and religious identities. On the other hand, we see the desire of a number of Western States to retain their self-proclaimed status as world leaders and slow the irreversible and objective process of establishing multipolarity. To that  end,  they  do not hesitate to use every possible method, including political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force.\nSuch illegal actions  devalue the  international law that underpins the post-war world order. We hear statements trumpeted that not only call into question the legal validity of international treaties, but also prioritize self-serving unilateral approaches over decisions made within the United Nations. We are seeing an assault  by belligerent revisionism on the modern system of international law. There have been attacks on the basic principles of the Middle East peace process, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear programme, commitments under the framework of  the World Trade Organization, the multilateral Paris Agreement on Climate Change and many more.\nAt the same time, our Western colleagues continue to seek to replace the supremacy of law in world affairs with some kind of so-called rules-based order. Those\n \nrules themselves are invented depending on whatever is politically expedient and are a reflection of double standards. Baseless accusations of interference in the internal affairs of various countries are being made alongside overt attempts to undermine and topple democratically elected Governments. Efforts are being made to draw some countries into military alliances that are designed to further specific agendas against the will of the peoples of those countries, while other States are threatened with punishment for their free choice of partners and allies. It is telling that aggressive attacks on international institutions are being accompanied by attempts to privatize their secretariat structures and grant them the rights of intergovernmental bodies in the hope of manipulating them later.\nThe shrinking space for constructive international cooperation, escalating confrontations, a growing overall lack of predictability, and a substantially higher risk of spontaneous conflicts all affect the work of this global Organization. The international  community has to pay a high price for the parochial, self-serving ambitions of a small group of countries. The collective mechanisms for responding to common security challenges have stalled. Diplomacy and a culture of negotiation and compromise are increasingly replaced by dictates and unilateral extraterritorial restrictions effected without the consent of the Security Council. Such measures, which have already been applied to dozens of countries, are ineffective as well as illegal, as demonstrated by the more  than  half-century  of the United States blockade of Cuba, which has been condemned by the entire international community.\nOnce again, however, the lessons are not being drawn from history. The number of those who  want  to hand down verdicts without bothering with charges or trials is not getting any smaller. Today assumptions in the spirit of the notorious \u201chighly likely\u201d approach seem to provide sufficient grounds for some of our Western colleagues to make accusations against anyone they want to. We have already been through that, and we well remember how often spurious pretexts have been used to justify interventions and unleash wars, as was the case in Yugoslavia in 1999, Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. The same methods are being used in Syria today. On 14 April, missile strikes were launched against Syria on a completely invented pretext, just hours before international inspectors were expected to arrive at the site of an incident that had been staged. This is a warning against any further provocations\nby terrorists and their patrons involving the use of chemical weapons, which would be unacceptable.\nThe conflict in Syria has already lasted seven years. The failed attempt to effect regime change, which was orchestrated from outside and relied on extremists, nearly resulted in the country\u2019s disintegration and the emergence of a terrorist caliphate in its place. Russia\u2019s energetic action, in response to the request of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and supported by diplomatic efforts in the context of the Astana process, helped prevent that devastating  scenario. The Syrian National Dialogue Congress, initiated by Russia, Iran and Turkey in Sochi in January, established the conditions for a political settlement in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and the basis for the intra-Syrian constitutional committee now being established in Geneva. Its agenda includes the restoration of ruined infrastructure in order to facilitate the return of millions of refugees to their homes. Assistance in addressing those issues in the interest of all Syrians, without double standards, must become a priority for international efforts and the activities of United Nations agencies.\nDespite the complexity of the situation in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, we  must  not  lose  sight  of the long-standing Palestinian question. A just and equitable solution to that issue is crucial to improving the situation throughout the Middle East. I want to warn against any unilateral  approaches  in  this area or attempts to monopolize this peace process. Today, as never before, the international community should consolidate its efforts with the aim of restarting talks on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. Russia will continue to do its utmost to facilitate the process, including within the Middle East Quartet and in cooperation with the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Mutually acceptable agreements must ensure the peaceful and safe coexistence of the two States of Israel and Palestine.\nHere at the United Nations, which was created on the basis of lessons learned from the Second World War, we must all think about a future in which the repetition of past mistakes should have no place. This year marks the eightieth anniversary of the notorious Munich agreement crowning the criminal policy of appeasement of the Third Reich, a sad example of the catastrophic consequences that can result from national\n \negotism, disregard for international law and attempts to solve problems at others\u2019 expense.\nRegrettably, in a number of countries today not only has the vaccine against the Nazi plague been weakened, but a rising campaign to rewrite history and whitewash war criminals and their associates is  emerging.  In our view, the campaigns being waged in a number of countries to demolish monuments to the liberators of Europe are an outrage. We call on the Assembly to support the draft of this year\u2019s versin of the annual resolution on the inadmissibility of glorification of the Nazis.\nThe growth of radical nationalism and neo-fascism in Ukraine, where criminals who fought under Waffen- SS banners have been declared heroes, is one of the main factors in the protracted intra-Ukrainian conflict. The only way to settle that conflict is to ensure the comprehensive and consistent implementation in good faith of the Minsk package of measures, approved unanimously by the Security Council in its resolution 2202 (2015). We support the activities of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and are ready to provide its monitors with United Nations protection.\nHowever, instead of implementing the Minsk agreements and engaging in dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk, Kyiv continues to harbour the illusion that it may be able to put occupying forces in Donbas with the support of the West and is increasingly threatening to resort to military options. The sponsors of the current Kyiv authorities must bring their clients to their senses, make them lift the blockade of Donbas and end discrimination against ethnic minorities throughout Ukraine.\nIn Kosovo, the international military presence authorized by the Security Council is being transformed into a United States military base, and Kosovo armed forces are being created. The agreements between Belgrade and Pristina brokered by the European Union are not being implemented. Russia calls on the parties to engage in dialogue in accordance with the principles of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and will support a decision that would be acceptable for Serbia. In general, we urge that the Balkans not be once again transformed into an arena for confrontation or declared to be someone\u2019s particular patrimony. The peoples of the Balkans must not be forced to face a false choice,\nand we must prevent new dividing lines from emerging in the region.\nWe need to shape an architecture of equal and indivisible security elsewhere in the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. We welcome the positive developments on the Korean peninsula following the logic of the Russian-Chinese road map. It is important to encourage that process, which should be based on continuing the rapprochement between the  parties and on promoting the practical implementation of the important arrangements arrived at by Pyongyang and Seoul through the Security Council. We will continue to work to launch a multilateral process aimed at establishing a robust mechanism for peace and security in North-East Asia as soon as possible.\nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is among the tasks before the international community in the key security area of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Regrettably, serious obstacles to that track continue to pile up. The unilateral withdrawal by the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in violation of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), and despite Iran\u2019s full compliance with its obligations, came on top of the lack of progress in the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. We will do everything possible to preserve the deal approved by the Security Council.\nWe are seeing increasingly negative  trends  in  the activities of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whereby the West is attempting to transform the Technical Secretariat into an instrument for punishing undesirable Governments, which risks compromising the OPCW\u2019s independent professional status, the universality of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the  exclusive  prerogatives of the Security Council. Those and other problems in the area of non-proliferation were discussed in detail in the Security Council on 26 September (see S/PV.8362), convened at a very timely moment by the United States presidency.\nWe firmly believe that any problems or concerns that arise in international relations should be addressed through a substantive dialogue. If there are any bones of contention, we should come together around the negotiating table, engage in talks, present facts, heed\n \nthe our partners\u2019 counterarguments and seek a balance of interests.\nIn the past couple of years, the debate on abuses in cyberspace has become more intense. I would like to draw attention to the fact that it was Russia that initiated discussion of international information-security issues at the United Nations 20 years ago. Against the backdrop of recent developments, it is becoming ever more urgent that under the auspices of the United Nations we should develop global rules for the responsible behaviour of States in cyberspace, including the principles of the non-use of force, non-interference in internal affairs and respect for State sovereignty. We intend to introduce a draft resolution to that effect in the First Committee. We also believe that it is important to start work on a convention on cybercrime, and we envisage holding the relevant discussions in the Third Committee.\nIt is more essential than ever to seek mutually acceptable agreements and the mutual consideration of interests in the areas of global trade and economic relations, which today are being subjected to an unprecedented degree of politicization. The values of free trade are being held hostage to trade wars and other forms of unfair competition.\nRussia has consistently  promoted  a  philosophy of shared economic development,  as  enshrined  in  the Greater Eurasian Partnership initiative launched by President Vladimir Putin, a large-scale project open to all Asian and European States regardless of their membership in other integration associations. If consistently implemented, it could help to develop a the space for extensive economic cooperation in Eurasia. In the long term, it could lay the foundations for a renewed continental security architecture fit for the realities of the twenty-first century.\nRussia will continue to do its utmost to build a world based on law, truth and justice, and we are not alone in that aspiration. Together with us, our allies and partners in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) group and an overwhelming majority of other countries are advocating for the democratization of all aspects of international affairs and in the interests of all States, without exception. The West should also heed that voice, which is becoming\nmore and more evident in the activities of the Group  of 20.\nIn today\u2019s turbulent circumstances, the growing relevance of the United Nations \u2014 the only existing forum for overcoming differences and coordinating the activities of the international community \u2014 is an objective reality. Cooperation, with a view to arriving at broadly acceptable solutions, was a priority built into the foundations of the United Nations from the very start. Today we must not fail to live up to the high goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and its dedication by the drafters to future generations.\nWe should recall the art of negotiation in order to be worthy of their legacy. Many of today\u2019s problems can be solved only on a basis of equality and mutual respect. Dictates and coercion, hallmarks of the era of colonialism, should once and for all be filed away in the archives or, better yet, consigned to the dustbin of history.\nSome great statesmen of the past have bequeathed to us many words of wisdom that have come to be aphorisms. Let me quote just one, from President Harry Truman: \u201cThe responsibility of the great States is to serve and not to dominate the world\u201d.\nI hope that a culture of mutually respectful dialogue will finally prevail. Russia will do everything it can to achieve that.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to offer our warm congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. Her many exceptional qualities bolster our deep conviction that she will successfully carry out her mission in the service of the nations of the world. Djibouti welcomes her election as President of the Assembly at this session in more ways than one. She  is the fourth woman to hold this position in 73 years. We assure her of my country\u2019s support in carrying out her mandate.\nI would also like to commend the dynamism, faith and commitment of her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k. I also congratulate Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on his many initiatives to advance the Organization\u2019s agenda and the ambitious United Nations reform plan designed and developed with the support of Member States. Even if there is a consensus on the general need for reforms to make our Organization more effective, it has not always been easy to convince Members and overcome the resistance and burdens often faced by this type of major undertaking.\nDespite improvements in a number of indicators, such as life expectancy, living standards and a drastic reduction in  the global  rate  of  extreme  poverty,  the observation we made last year in the General Assembly (see A/72/PV.19) remains valid. Even if some parts of the world are experiencing growth, the risks of diminished prospects loom large. Prospects for economic expansion exacerbate the risk of increased tensions and trade disputes. Gross inequalities persist, and the  major  geopolitical  upheavals   under  way are generating growing uncertainty. Similarly, the persistence and increased complexity of some conflicts is a major concern.\nThe number of people leaving their country because their lives are in danger is on the rise. More and more people are leaving in search of a better life and taking to the sea, sometimes risking their lives in the process. That  migratory  flow  has  unwittingly  contributed  to the emergence of a bitter political debate in many northern countries. Such fierce debates, if seen without\na dose of critical distance, could challenge the feeling of belonging to a common humanity bound by the common responsibility to build a better world together.\nThe crisis of multilateralism that we are witnessing, the protectionist tendencies that we are observing, the palpable temptation of retreating into nationalism and sometimes even autism are the consequences of this emerging ideology. It posits that we  must rely  only on ourselves, that we can only rely on ourselves, thus contradicting the philosophical wisdom of Rimbaud: \u201cI is another\u201d. Hence the importance of this session\u2019s theme, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, as an instrument to guide our collective reflection. All of our proposals and contributions could be compiled into a manifesto to renew and restore the faith and confidence that our peoples have in the United Nations system and its ability to respond to their problems.\nDjibouti welcomes the fact that in response to each of the perils mentioned above, the international community has mobilized and formulated responses and developed action plans through particularly well- conducted intergovernmental processes. Among those successes, I note the adoption of the reforms undertaken by the Secretary-General in some key areas \u2014 the repositioning of the United Nations development system in the implementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for humankind; management reform; and the reform of the peace and security architecture.\nWe also note the finalization of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration through an open, transparent and inclusive process. It is set to be adopted in Marrakesh in December.\nSimilarly, the finalization of the global compact on refugees, which will be submitted to the General Assembly for its  consideration  during  this  session, is a major development. Refugees are particularly vulnerable. Since the United Nations is unable to address, in a sustainable manner, the causes of the conflicts that led to their exile, it must provide an adequate response to their needs.\nEfforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  encourage  and  motivate us. The current momentum to  adopt  and  integrate the Sustainable Development Goals into national planning and institutional initiatives should continue with renewed energy. The aim should be to deepen\n \nreflection and exchanges, and to establish participatory frameworks and new partnership models. We must redirect investments to the improvement of data collection on sustainable development and  statistics on gender, health, education and the environment. Djibouti is pleased to be able to present its first voluntary review soon and considers this opportunity for introspection beneficial.\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s strategy to mobilize increased resources for financing the  2030 Agenda. In that regard, let me  stress again that  it will be necessary both to think about innovative financing strategies aimed at ensuring an increase in foreign direct investment and to honour development aid commitments.\nThe greatest threat to the implementation of the transformative agenda that is Agenda 2030 is undoubtedly conflict and violence. Conflicts in several parts of the world continue to increase the death toll, and the nature of the specific challenges they pose will require the sustained attention of the international community. The expansion of terrorism and international organized crime further complicates already fragile situations and requires different responses than those proposed by conventional peace operations. It also sorely tests the diplomatic negotiation tools at our disposal, which we must urgently and thoroughly review.\nIn contrast to that gloomy picture, the Horn of Africa has seen a series of historic positive  developments that are likely to generate peace dividends and lead  to reconciliation and economic development. We welcome the rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which ended two decades of neither war nor peace and inaugurated a new era of peace, friendship and cooperation between the two countries. The positive repercussions for other inter-State conflicts in the countries of the region have been rapid and, we hope, substantial.\nIn that regard, I would like to inform the Assembly that  the  Presidents  of  Djibouti  and  Eritrea  met  on\n17 September in Jeddah, under the auspices of His Majesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia, and agreed to open a new chapter in relations between the two brotherly countries. At the end of the meeting and thanks to the tireless efforts of the King of Saudi Arabia and the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, the Presidents agreed to continue the dialogue with a view to finding a peaceful solution to\nthe outstanding issues, including the border dispute and the prisoners of war.\nWe also welcome the Peace Agreement signed between President Salva Kiir of South Sudan and the head of the rebellion on 12 September in Addis Ababa under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. We hope that it can be fully and unconditionally implemented. The South Sudanese people have suffered too much. They deserves peace and the opportunity to build a better future.\nWe are encouraged by the tremendous progress made by Somalia in building strong institutions and restoring peace, stability and economic growth. Although we recognize the significant progress made, we must work together to identify and combat the actors who seek to block political normalization, particularly the Al-Shabaab terrorist groups, and do all we can to build greater coherence and unity of action between the federal Government and other federal units. We take this opportunity to pay tribute to the troops of the African Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), whose crucial role has been amply demonstrated on the ground. AMISOM\u2019s support of Somali forces is crucial to ensuring that the transfer of security responsibilities can be carried out under the best possible conditions.\nThe question of Palestine must continue to mobilize the international community. There is no alternative  to the two-State solution. Moreover, the issue of Palestinian refugees must also be of concern to us all.\nI would be remiss if I did not make mention of the suffering of the Rohingya people, who today are being threatened with ethnic cleansing, as the international community has witnessed. We must pressure the Government of Myanmar to allow the return of the Rohingyan refugees.\nThe United Nations has made a significant contribution to the efforts to maintain international peace and security. It has played a crucial role in promoting international cooperation among States. It is the responsibility of us all to strengthen its role and to make it a global force.\nDjibouti is ready to work alongside the other nations of the world for the creation of a safer, more united and more prosperous world. The stakes are high, and the call is urgent. Long live the nations of the world! Long live the United Nations!\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of the President, the Government and the people of the Republic of Guinea, I would like to convey our sincere condolences on the death of Mr. Kofi Annan, a great son of Africa and former Secretary- General of the United Nations, who dedicated his life to promoting peace, international humanitarian law and multilateralism.\nMy delegation would like to congratulate the President on her election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-third session and to assure her of its support for the success of her  term. Guinea would  like to pay a well-deserved tribute to her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Lajc\u00e1k, for his inclusive presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, during a crucial period of reform of our Organization.\nMy delegation also warmly congratulates Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on his  vision  and the commendable  efforts  he  has  taken  to  give a new impetus to the United Nations, which is beset by political, economic and social challenges in an ever-changing international context. It is  clear  that, in addressing those challenges, we must give priority to new, more pragmatic, effective and coordinated approaches to achieving the objectives set out in the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe seventy-third session, under this year\u2019s theme of \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable  societies\u201d,  calls on us to urgently strengthen the global leadership of the United Nations with respect to the  requirements of reform and the aspirations contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We must recall that the United Nations was created in the aftermath of one of humankind\u2019s most devastating wars, suffered the stigma of the Cold War and was shaken by the turbulences linked to the end of that same Cold War. However, it has resisted all attempts to weaken it by making it ineffective at managing certain crises that threaten peace and stability throughout the world.\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, the United Nations is the only multilateral platform capable of adopting a global and concerted approach in seeking solutions to the many challenges it faces. During a period of deep crisis for the Organization, Secretary- General Kofi Annan recalled the following:\n\u201c[A] group of far-sighted leaders... saw that the human race had only one world to live in, and that unless it managed its affairs prudently, all human beings might perish. So they drew up rules to govern international behaviour and founded a network of institutions, with the United Nations at its centre, in which the peoples of the world could work together for the common good.\u201d (A/58/PV.7, p.3)\nToday, the  purposes  and  principles  contained  in the Charter of the United Nations remain more relevant than ever. The universality of the United Nations in maintaining international peace, security and prosperity in the world is confirmed on a daily basis. The multiple fields of action make it possible to assist Member States in their development processes. That is why we must remain determined and resolutely committed to implementing the reforms that are crucial for our Organization.\nThe Republic of Guinea supports that ongoing reform   process,   initiated   by   Secretary-General, in particular in the pillars of peace, security and sustainable development. Guinea cannot insist enough on the need for Security Council reform. It is time to take into account Africa\u2019s demographic, political and economic importance in order to give it the role it can and must play on the international stage and to redress the injustice the continent has suffered by  granting    it two permanent seats and as many non-permanent seats. The results of the reform must  ultimately lead to the establishment of  a  fair and  equitable system  of international cooperation based on solidarity and shared responsibility.\nThe seventy-third session of the General Assembly coincides this year with the sixtieth anniversary of the Republic of Guinea\u2019s independence, on 2 October 1958. In the same year, it joined the Organization as the eighty- second State Member of the United Nations. As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of our independence, we will be flying the flag of pan-Africanism. It is clear that the United Nations has been and remains for Guinea a multilateral forum that has enabled it to realize the ideals for it has struggled so much, including its pan-African vision of independence, the fight against apartheid, the promotion of peace and security, and the socioeconomic development of the continent.\nToday, under the dynamic leadership of the President of the Republic of Guinea, His Excellency Mr. Alpha Cond\u00e9, our country has made significant\n \nprogress in the economic and social fields, which can guarantee a better future for the people of Guinea.  The megaprojects carried out in the energy and agriculture sectors and the creation of infrastructure that is crucial to development have been welcomed by the Guinean people because they are convinced that those achievements will certainly lead to Guinea\u2019s development by 2040.\nBased on the priorities of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 2063 Agenda of the African Union, Guinea has focused on the ownership and implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, our country, at the third High- level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, presented its first voluntary national review \u2014 for 2018 \u2014 on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. That was a timely opportunity for my country to share with other Member States its experience in the process of implementing its sustainable development programme by 2040.\nThe Government\u2019s determination to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals was supported by the 2016-2020 national economic and social development plan, guided by the forward- looking \u201cGuinea Vision 2040\u201d plan, which aims to make development planning the appropriate instrument for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In this regard, Guinea is counting on the support of the United Nations and other partners.\nThe Government strongly appreciates the new climate of dialogue for the promotion of sustainable peace in Africa, as peace and security are essential conditions for inclusive development. The tangible progress achieved in the strategic partnerships between the United Nations and African peace missions, as well as the significant progress in crisis management in Guinea-Bissau, South Sudan, Somalia and in the disputes between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between Eritrea and Djibouti, confirm  once  again  the  need to continue to focus on political solutions to create a peaceful environment conducive to development.\nWe are convinced  that  substantial  investments in conflict prevention and the quest for political solutions will save humankind countless lives and the destruction of infrastructure. However, these positive developments that have been made here and there should not distract us from our common struggle against international terrorism and violent extremism. That is\nwhy my delegation strongly condemns the barbaric acts committed against innocent people in Africa and throughout the world. It urges the major Powers to support Africa in its fight against these scourges and to support the Group of Five for the Sahel in confronting the atrocities committed by terrorist groups so as to restore lasting peace in the Sahel region.\nGuinea welcomes the implementation of the United Nations Support Plan for the Sahel, entitled \u201cSahel, Land of Opportunities\u201d, which targets 10 countries, including Guinea. The plan focuses on six key areas: cross-border cooperation, prevention, peacekeeping, inclusive growth, climate and renewable energy. Partnerships with Member States, regional economic communities, civil society and donors will facilitate the implementation of various development projects, help to fight extreme poverty, improve the humanitarian situation, strengthen resilience to change and reduce the scourge of food insecurity.\nIf there is another situation where the role of the United Nations remains indisputable, it is the conflict in the Middle East, which remains a major  concern for the international community. Guinea has always unambiguously expressed its unconditional solidarity with the just cause of the Palestinian people. We remain convinced that any viable and sustainable solution in the Middle East necessarily means respecting and implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions that call for the creation of two States living side by side in security and within safe and internationally recognized borders.\nConflicts    \u2014    in    particular    protracted crises \u2014 environmental degradation and human rights violations continue to increase humanitarian needs, which are currently estimated at nearly $22.5 billion. However, the mobilization of funds is hampered not only by a lack of solidarity but also the drastic cuts to the United Nations budget. That is why the management of generated funds must be transparent and inclusive.\nOf all the humanitarian challenges, the issue of human mobility is the most consequential for us and therefore requires greater solidarity and the sharing of responsibilities. That is why we welcome the advent of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which is a source of hope for more than 258 million international migrants, composed largely of women and children. This important document, which the Republic of Guinea will adopt in December in Marrakech,\n \nwill strike a balance between State sovereignty and fundamental rights. The compact is fundamentally aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, while providing an important monitoring mechanism.\nThe achievement of social well-being through the Sustainable Development Goals can be made possible only if we succeed in ridding our world of recurring diseases. It is therefore important to strengthen our solidarity in the fight against communicable and non-communicable diseases, which continue to decimate a large part of the world\u2019s population. My delegation welcomes the steps taken and the progress made in effectively eradicating tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other diseases. We wholeheartedly support the United Nations project for universal health coverage.\nThe creation of an inclusive  society  underpins the elimination of inequalities and social barriers that prevent the participation of young people and women in economic and political activities. Gender equality and the promotion and empowerment of young people and women are fundamental to achieving sustainable development and must be taken into account in development policies.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary- General, who has been working since his inauguration for the achievement of  parity through appointments  to the higher bodies of the United Nations. We have a responsibility to perpetuate that good practice within the United Nations and other international and national institutions, as it is in line with the agreements on gender and women\u2019s rights.\nI would like to conclude by emphasizing that the United Nations remains the only institution that can maintain global balance and ensure our collective security and shared prosperity. Any withdrawal into ourselves would be detrimental to peace and stability around the world. Multilateralism therefore remains the only way forward to effectively achieve the goals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate the President on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I wish to assure her and members of the Assembly of my delegation\u2019s support.  I commend Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who continues to guide the Organization through a process of reform that is vital for the continued relevance of our\n \nOrganization. I also pay tribute to the late Kofi Annan for the immense contribution he made to the United Nations and the global community.\nThis year, as we mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, it is fitting that the theme for this seventy-third session is \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. One of the painful lessons learned from the two world wars was the necessity for nations to work together to minimize conflicts and promote economic and social development. The relevance of the United Nations to the global community is without question. That is not to say that we ought not to strive to achieve more \u2014 it is imperative that we do.\nAs nations, we must intensify our deliberations and commitments to addressing climate change. Climate change is a clear and present danger to us all, but in particular to low-lying coastal nations like the Bahamas. We see that in the rising sea levels, the loss of coral reefs and the increased volume of acid in our oceans, as well as the more severe and  frequent hurricanes and typhoons. This time last year, the Bahamas, along with many countries in the Caribbean and  parts of  the United States of America, faced the onslaught of hurricanes of category 4 or higher. As Hurricane Irma hurtled towards the Bahamas, my Government took the difficult decision to evacuate residents from the southern islands in order to prevent injury and the loss of life. We fortunately escaped without loss of life, but our southern neighbours were not as fortunate. As such, I fully support the Secretary-General\u2019s plan to call a climate summit next September to mobilize action and financial support.\nAs part of such discussions, we must dedicate considerably more energy and resources to building the resilience and sustainability of our island and coastal nations. Like our neighbours, the Bahamas is trying to rebuild its islands. However, the accumulated damage of a series of major hurricanes has made that very difficult. As an archipelago of many islands stretching approximately 600 miles from north to south, we are required to replicate infrastructure many times over with already limited resources.\nWhile the delivery of humanitarian aid is essential, it is equally important to focus on prevention and the strengthening of capacity-building. Such a focus must be grounded in a comprehensive approach to sustainable\ndevelopment that addresses, in an integrated manner, the range of issues that are critical to the Bahamas, from disaster-risk reduction to the sustainable use of the world\u2019s seas and oceans, in order to ensure their viability for generations to come. Tourism is the world\u2019s largest industry. It is also the lifeblood of the Bahamian economy. Millions of tourists travel to the Bahamas annually because of our beautiful turquoise waters and biodiversity. In that context, the Bahamas has committed to banning single-use plastics by 2020.\nThe Bahamas looks forward to the successful outcomes of the review of the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway, the international framework that seeks to advance those and other sustainable development priorities for small island developing States. The Bahamas will also advocate for a strong outcome at the intergovernmental conference on an international, legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nEarlier this week, I participated in the Bloomberg round table on building resilient economies and preservingmarineecosystemsincoastal Commonwealth nations. I commend such dialogues. However, I must stress that the Bahamas and our neighbours are being punished twice for circumstances that are not of our own making. It is not our island nations that are primarily responsible for the climate change  that has resulted  in the recent scourges of hurricanes and other natural disasters that ravage our islands. However, when we respond to national needs by borrowing internationally, seeking to restore basic human infrastructure, our debt to gross domestic product  ratio  rises,  risking the possibility of a rating downgrade. That limits our ability to provide for ourselves, but we are burdened with a price tag too heavy to be borne.\nA relevant United Nations should urgently facilitate a meaningful dialogue on the international stage to establish a workable solution. Furthermore, the adverse impact of global financial inequity is seen in the use of the distorted matrix of the per capita gross domestic product as a measure of national wealth and viability. That is done without due regard being given to a country\u2019s vulnerabilities and the weight that should be accorded to local circumstances. We remain concerned and disappointed that the application of that matrix causes the Bahamas to be assessed as being economically stronger than the threshold level for contributions from\n \ninternational financial organizations and for receiving grants and international assistance when disasters strike. The United Nations must devote greater focus and action to that inequitable issue.\nWe also reaffirm our support for  Cuba\u2019s  ability to access resources for development to rebuild after disasters.  Similarly, notwithstanding  the  strong  and unwavering commitment to the integrity of our financial-services industry, the Bahamas, like other jurisdictions, is fighting an uphill battle to avoid being blacklisted as a non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes. The goalposts for cooperation are constantly being moved. They are being inequitably applied with unfair advantages to some and disadvantages to others. The Bahamas remains committed  to  international tax transparency and cooperation, the exchange of information and international regulatory standards, as well as to conducting business in a fair, transparent and competitive manner.\nThe  Bahamas  comprehensively  seeks   to provide greater opportunities to our disadvantaged urban centres through revitalization, economic empowerment and poverty-alleviation initiatives. Those initiatives have been designed to be consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). My Government is committed to achieving the SDGs and will continue to work with the United Nations and our other international partners and domestic stakeholders towards their implementation.\nThe Bahamas is dedicated to serving as a productive presence and committed member of the Council of the International Maritime Organization. We have presented our candidature for re-election in category C in the 2019 elections. The Bahamas intends to continue its efforts to make positive and innovative contributions towards ensuring the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by maritime vessels.\nThe Bahamas remains committed to the protection and promotion of human rights and gender equality. The geographical location of the Bahamas has made us particularly vulnerable to illegal migration. We have been embattled by that problem for decades. However, we are firmly resolved to fight illegal  migration and to do so in a manner that prioritizes the safety and security of the Bahamas, while adhering to human rights principles. The Bahamas is committed to the use of information communication technology to\nsupport development. We have offered ourselves  as the smart choice with our candidature for the Council of  the International   Telecommunication   Union. The Bahamas has been endorsed by our Caribbean Community neighbours.\nThe world continues to make progress in myriad areas of economic, political and social development. But progress requires the eternal vigilance of each generation, a recommitment to upholding the dignity and equality of all people and unrelenting international cooperation. I wish to reaffirm the commitment of the Bahamas to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to join others in paying tribute to the memory of the late Kofi Annan, a true world leader and a firm believer in the strength of this Organization.\nSeventy years ago, the General Assembly adopted the first global human rights charter, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It codified the most basic principles of human dignity, emphasizing that we are all equal. We committed to an international order in which rights and freedoms could be fully realized.\nSeventy years ago, we knew that international cooperation was the only way to protect our populations, and through this Organization, we have delivered remarkable results.\nStill, the foundation on which this Organization is built has perhaps never been under more pressure than it is today. The very principle of multilateralism is being questioned. Doubt is being cast on the frameworks that protect human rights, ensure free trade and promote global development. Insufficient action is being taken on global problems such as climate change, poverty, migration, terrorism and violent extremism.\nTo Denmark, the path forward is clear. Global challenges require global solutions. To that end, we need a strong United Nations, with its unique legitimacy and its universal membership, a United Nations that delivers on its full potential.\nDenmark remains committed to the Secretary- General\u2019s reform agenda. This year we open the General Assembly with three agreed tracks for reform. Together with Algeria, Denmark had the honour to facilitate the negotiations on reform of the development system. We are proud of the result, and we  will continue to play    a constructive role in the important implementation ahead. For instance, Denmark intends to contribute more than $10 million to support the establishment of\n \nthe new Resident Coordinator system, and we encourage others to follow suit.\nMember States have clearly voiced their support. Now the reforms must be turned into reality. The world expects a new and more streamlined United Nations to emerge. Every entity of the United Nations must embrace this opportunity to change and make real improvements for the benefit of our peoples.\nAs Member States,  we  must  also  reinvest  in  the United  Nations  and  take  responsibility   for   our multilateral cooperation and the rules-based international order. That is why Denmark has presented its candidature for membership of the Human Rights Council for the 2019-2021 term. If elected, we will promote the rights and equal opportunities of women, continue our long-standing fight  against  torture, work to protect the rights of indigenous peoples and encourage freedom of religion and belief. That must be done without discrimination on any ground, including sexual orientation and gender identity. That is the Danish DNA and the DNA of the United Nations.\nIn several parts of the world, gender equality is but a distant hope. Women\u2019s rights are under increasing pressure. We cannot accept that; we must stand up and challenge it. Every woman must be able  to unleash  her potential \u2014 without question \u2014 to the benefit of all. We must ensure that she is the one making the decisions concerning her. Gender equality and equal opportunities are not only fundamental human rights but preconditions for development, peace and prosperity in any country, anywhere in the world.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change set out a strong global vision for achieving a more sustainable planet. Denmark is committed to that common vision. For more than 40 consecutive years, we have proudly delivered on the United Nations target of providing\n0.7 per cent of our gross national income as official development assistance (ODA). Sadly, we are in a group that has far too few members. While ODA is crucial for ensuring global development, we need the involvement of all actors, especially the private sector, civil society and local authorities.\nWe must give young  people  a  seat  at  the  table in order to ensure that development is  pursued not  just for young people but with and by them. That is why Denmark was the first country to announce a contribution to the Secretary-General\u2019s new Youth\n2030 strategy. We congratulate the United Nations and all young people on that strategy and look forward to seeing it in action.\nMember States and the United Nations system have to adapt to the world around us and embrace and use new technologies. We need the innovative ideas, the finance and the expertise that only the private sector can bring to the table. In short, in order to attain the Sustainable Development Goals over the next 12 years, we must rethink the way we do business here. The clock is ticking. That is one of the reasons that Denmark, together with its partners, launched  the  Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) initiative. Through the P4G network, we bring together major companies, cities, civil society, think tanks and Governments to boost and create partnerships for a greener tomorrow. In October, Denmark will host a high-level P4G summit in Copenhagen to forge and accelerate such partnerships.\nEducation provides the foundations for knowledge and for harnessing the technologies and opportunities of tomorrow. When it comes to education, we can and must do better, much better. Globally, 130 million girls do not go to school. In crisis situations, girls are two and a half times less likely to be at school than boys. Girls are at much greater risk than boys of being victims of sexual abuse or exploitation, and much more likely to be affected by child marriage or childbirth. Just think. In some parts of the world, girls as young as nine years old are being forced to marry adult men. That is not acceptable. We must let girls be girls, not brides.\nEducation is a beacon of hope for those  girls.  That is why Denmark is now the largest contributor to Education Cannot Wait, and why we will spend almost\n$70 million next year on education in developing countries, because Denmark wants to ensure that no girl will be left behind.\nDisplacement and unsafe and irregular migration pose a significant global challenge that requires determined efforts at all levels. In July, Denmark welcomed the finalization of the negotiations on a global compact on migration. The compact establishes a global framework for common action and a much- needed path for managing irregular migration in  a safe and orderly manner and for curbing irregular migration, including through the facilitation of return, with respect for human rights and the principle of State sovereignty at its core.\n \nWe also welcome the agreement on the global compact on refugees. Denmark is, per capita, one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian donors. A key focus of ours is helping refugees and internally displaced persons in their efforts to attain a life of safety and dignity. By ensuring close coordination between our humanitarian and development aid,  Denmark  helps to build the foundation for lasting solutions and safe return when the time is right.\nThe horrors in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere tell the grim story of why humanitarian efforts are so desperately needed. The conflict in Syria rages into its eighth year. So many have already experienced unspeakable suffering, evil and atrocities. Three million people have been on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib. The tragedy in Syria cannot continue.\nEarlier this week, Member States honoured Nelson Mandela. In a fitting celebration of an iconic proponent of peace, leaders from across the world underscored the importance of our joint commitment to building a peaceful and prosperous world.\nAs we push for reforms and strengthen our multilateral institutions, we must acknowledge the interconnectedness  of  today\u2019s  global   challenges. We need integrated and shared approaches to stabilization, peacebuilding and conflict prevention. That is why Denmark has been a strong supporter of the Peacebuilding Fund. We are proud to step up our commitment with a new contribution to the Fund of\n$15 million over the next three years.\nThe world is witnessing armed conflicts that could have been prevented or stopped years ago. Too many States are failing in their responsibility to protect their own populations against the most horrific crimes.\nDenmark will continue to insist on accountability for the most appalling crimes. Such crimes  must  never go unpunished, and the victims deserve justice. This year we mark the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the International Criminal Court, a landmark achievement aimed at ensuring accountability and justice.\nThe recent report of the United Nations Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (A/HRC/39/64) clearly underlines the need for accountability in relation to the Rohingya crisis. At the same time, we must not forget the enormous need for humanitarian assistance and development aid. I am happy to announce\nthat Denmark will provide another $7 million as an extraordinary humanitarian response to that crisis. That is in addition to the $46 million we have already provided since 2017. Denmark also provides support  to the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary- General on Myanmar.\nThe situation on the Korean peninsula is a strong reminder of what is at stake. Denmark fully supports the continuing efforts by South Korea and the United States to seek a diplomatic solution with the North Korean regime. North Korea must now take concrete steps towards complete, verifiable and irreversible\n \ndenuclearization. Until then, sanctions and international pressure must remain firmly in place.\nThe problems facing the world are dire. We will be successful only if we act together. Multilateralism and cooperation must be the foundation. The task may seem impossible, but we have done it before. With the United Nations, we have fostered an international order, a strong set of common values, rules and goals. People around the world demand solutions. The United Nations cannot let them down. Now is the time for us to reform and rebuild this institution.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to join others in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I am confident that with her wisdom and vast experience, this session will achieve the objectives of its theme. I  assure her of Malaysia\u2019s full support and cooperation towards achieving those noble goals.\nAllow me to also pay tribute to her predecessor, Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his dedication and stewardship in successfully completing the work of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly. I also commend the Secretary-General and the United Nations staff for their tireless efforts in steering and managing the Organization\u2019s activities globally.\nI particularly want to pay tribute to the late Kofi Annan, who served as the Organization\u2019s seventh Secretary-General from 1997 to 2006 and, sadly, passed away in August. Malaysia enjoyed a positive and active engagement with the United Nations during his tenure.\nThe theme of this seventy-third session of the General Assembly, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, remains true to the aspirations of our founding fathers. The theme is most relevant and timely and is especially pertinent in the context of the new Malaysia. The new Government of Malaysia, recently empowered with a strong mandate from its people, is committed to ensuring that every Malaysian has an equitable share in the prosperity and wealth of the nation.\nA new Malaysia emerged after the fourteenth general election, in May this year, in which Malaysians decided to change their Government, which had been in power for 61 years, that is, since independence. We did that because the previous Administration indulged in a politics of hatred, racial and  religious  bigotry and widespread corruption. The process of  change was achieved democratically, without violence or loss of life.\nMalaysians want a new Malaysia that upholds the principles of fairness, good governance, integrity and the rule of law. They want a Malaysia that is a friend to all and an enemy to none, a Malaysia that remains neutral and non-aligned, a Malaysia that detests and abhors war and violence. They also want a Malaysia that will speak its mind on what is right and wrong, without fear or favour; a new Malaysia that believes in cooperation based on mutual respect and mutual gain; a new Malaysia that offers a partnership based on our \u201cprosper-thy-neighbour\u201d philosophy. We believe in  the goodness of cooperation and that prosperous and stable neighbours contribute to our own  prosperity and stability.\nThe new Malaysia will firmly espouse the principles promoted by the United Nations in our international engagements. Those include the principles of truth, human rights, the rule of law, justice, fairness, responsibility and accountability, as well as sustainability. It is within that context that the new Government of Malaysia has pledged to ratify all remaining core United Nations instruments related to the protection of human rights. It will not be easy for us\n \nto do because Malaysia is multi-ethnic, multireligious, multicultural and multilingual. We will provide the space and time for all to deliberate and to decide freely based on the principles of democracy.\nWhen I last spoke here, in 2003 (see A/58/PV.11), I lamented how the world had lost its way. I bemoaned the fact that small countries continued to be at the mercy of the powerful. I argued for the need for the developing world to push for reform, enhance capacity-building and diversify the economy. We needed to maintain control of our destiny.\nToday, 15 years later, the world has not changed very much. If anything, the world is far worse. Today, the world is in a state of turmoil economically, socially and politically. There is a trade war between the two most powerful nations, and the rest of the world is feeling the pain. Socially, new values are acting to undermine the stability of nations and their people. Freedom has led to the negation of the concept of marriage and families, moral codes and respect for one another.\nBut the worst turmoil is in the political arena. We see acts of terror everywhere. People are tying bombs to their bodies and blowing themselves up in crowded places. Trucks are driven into holiday crowds. Wars are fought, and people beheaded with short knives. Acts of brutality are broadcast live to the world. Masses of people risk their lives to migrate, only to be denied asylum while being forced to sleep in the open and freeze to death. Thousands starve, and tens of thousands die in cholera epidemics. No one, no country is safe. Security checks inconvenience travellers. There can be no liquids on planes. The slightest suspicion leads to detention and unpleasant questioning.\nIn order to fight the terrorists, all kinds of security measures, gadgets and equipment are deployed. Big brother is watching, but acts of terror continue. Malaysia fought the bandits and terrorists for independence and defeated them. We used the military, to be sure, but alongside it \u2014 and more importantly \u2014 we campaigned to win the hearts and minds of the people. The present war against the terrorists will not end until the root causes are found and removed and hearts and minds are won.\nWhat are the root causes? In 1948, Palestinian land was seized to form the State of Israel. The Palestinians were massacred and forced to leave their land. Their homes and farms were seized. They tried to fight a conventional war with help from sympathetic\nneighbours; the friends of Israel ensured that that attempt failed. More Palestinian land was seized, and Israeli settlements were built on more and more Palestinian land. The Palestinians themselves are denied access  to the settlements built on their land. The Palestinians initially tried to fight with catapults and stones. They were fired on with live bullets and arrested. Thousands are incarcerated. Frustrated and angry, unable to fight a conventional war, the Palestinians resort to what we call terrorism.\nThe world does not care, even when Israel breaks international laws, seizing ships carrying medicine, food and building materials in international waters. The Palestinians fired ineffective rockets that hurt no one. Massive retaliations were mounted by Israel, rocketing and bombing hospitals, schools and other buildings and killing innocent civilians, including schoolchildren and hospital patients, among others. The world has rewarded Israel, deliberately provoking Palestine by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\nIt is the anger and frustration of the Palestinians and their sympathizers that cause them to resort to what we call terrorism, but it is important to acknowledge that any act that terrifies people also constitutes terrorism. States dropping bombs or launching rockets that maim and kill innocent people also terrify people \u2014 they are also acts of terrorism.\nMalaysia hates terrorism. We will fight it, but we believe that the only way to fight terrorism is to remove the cause. Let the Palestinians return to reclaim their land. Let there be a State of Palestine. Let there be justice and the rule of law. Warring against them will not stop terrorism, nor will out-terrorizing them succeed.\nWe need to remind ourselves that the United Nations, like the League of Nations before it, was conceived for the noble purpose of ending wars between nations. Wars are about killing people. Modern wars are about mass killings and total destruction countrywide. Civilized nations claim that they abhor killing for any reason. When a man kills, he commits the crime of murder, and the punishment for that may be death.\nBut wars, as we all know, encourage and legitimize killing. Indeed, such killings are regarded as noble, and the killers are hailed as heroes. They have medals pinned to their chests and statues erected in their honour, with their names mentioned in the history books. There is something wrong with our way of thinking and with\n \nour value system. Kill one man and it is murder; kill a million and they become a hero.\nHowever, we persist in believing that conflict between nations can be resolved with war, and because we do so, we must prepare for war. The old adage says, \u201cif you want peace, prepare for war\u201d. We are forever preparing for war, inventing more and more destructive weapons. We now have nuclear bombs that are capable of destroying whole cities, but we also now know that the radiation emanating from the explosion will affect even the country that uses the bomb. A nuclear war would destroy the world.\nThat fear has caused the countries of Europe and North America to maintain peace for over 70 years. However, that is not the case for other countries. Wars in the other countries can help test the new weapons being invented, and so the arms exporters sell them to warring countries. We see their arms in wars fought between smaller nations. Those are not world wars, but they are no less destructive. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, whole countries devastated, and nations bankrupted because of fantastic new weapons.\nSuch wars give handsome dividends to the arms manufacturers and traders. The  arms  business  is now the largest business in the world. They profit shamelessly from the deaths and destruction that they cause. Indeed, so-called peace-loving countries often promote that shameful business. Today\u2019s weapons cost millions. Fighter jets cost about $100 million each, and maintaining them can cost tens of millions. Yet poorer countries are persuaded to buy them, even if they cannot afford them. They are told that their neighbours or their enemies have them. It is therefore imperative that they, too, have such weapons. While their people starve and suffer from all kinds of deprivation, a huge percentage of the budget of many countries is allocated to the purchase of modern arms. The fact that their buyers may never have to use them does not bother the purveyors at all.\nIn Myanmar, Muslims in Rakhine state are being murdered and their homes torched. Millions of refugees have been forced to flee, to drown in the high seas or live in makeshift huts without water or food and with the most primitive sanitation. Yet the authorities of Myanmar, including a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, deny that that is happening. I believe in non-interference in the internal affairs of nations, but is the world supposed to watch massacres being carried out and do nothing?\nNations are independent, but does that independence mean they have a right to massacre their own people?\nOn the other hand, in terms of trade, nations are no longer independent. Free trade means that there is no protection for the infant industries in small countries. They must abandon tariff restrictions and open their countries to invasion by the products of the rich and powerful. Yet the simple products of the poor are subjected to clever barriers so that they cannot penetrate the market of the rich. Malaysian palm oil is labelled as harmful to health, and it is claimed that the palm oil estates are destroying animal habitats. Food products of the rich are declared to be free of palm oil. Now palm diesel is also condemned because the producers decimate virgin jungles. The caring people making those claims forget that their boycott deprives hundreds of thousands of people of jobs and a decent life. We in Malaysia care for the environment. Some 48 per cent of our country remains virgin jungle. Can our detractors claim the same about their own countries?\nMalaysia is committed to sustainable development. We have taken steps, for example by improving production methods, in order to ensure that our palm oil production is sustainable. By December 2019, the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil standard will become mandatory. That will ensure that every drop of palm oil produced in Malaysia will be certified as sustainable by 2020.\nAll around the world, we observe a dangerous trend towards inward-looking nationalism. We see Governments pandering to populism, retreating from international collaboration and closing their borders  to the free movement of people, goods and services, even as they talk of a borderless world and free trade. While globalization has indeed brought us some benefits, the effects have been proven to threaten the independence of small nations. We cannot even talk or move around without having our voices and movements recorded and often used against us. Data on everyone is being captured and traded by powerful nations and their corporations.\nMalaysia lauds the United Nations for its endeavours to end poverty and protect our planet and for its efforts to try to ensure that everyone enjoys peace and prosperity. However, I would like to mention the need for reform in the Organization. Five countries, on the basis of their victories in wars fought more than 70 years ago, must not be allowed to claim to have a\n \nright to hold the world to ransom forever. They cannot take the moral high ground, preaching democracy and regime change in the countries of the world while they deny democracy in this Organization.\nI have suggested that the vetoing of a draft resolution in the Security Council should require that at least two permanent members, supported by three non-permanent members of the Council, vote against it. The General Assembly should then uphold the decision with a simple majority. I will not say any more.\nI must admit that the world without the United Nations would be disastrous. We need the United Nations, and we need to sustain it with sufficient funds. No one should threaten it with financial deprivation.\nAfter 15 years\u2019 absence and at 93  years  old,  I now return to this rostrum with the burdensome task of bringing the voice and hopes of the new Malaysia  to the world stage. The people of Malaysia, proud of their recent democratic achievement, have high hopes that around the world we will see peace, progress and prosperity. For that, we look to the United Nations to hear our plea.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour and privilege to be here today to convey the warm greetings of His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam to all gathered here in this Hall.\nI express my congratulations to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s and the people of Ecuador on her assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I also convey my appreciation to Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his hard work in the service of the international community. I also do not want to forget his staff, which continues its work throughout the year, not just on a Saturday afternoon.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to join others in expressing our condolences to the family of the late former Secretary-General Kofi Atta Annan, whose remarkable service to the Organization and many valuable contributions to advancing global peace, humanity and development serve as an inspiration to us all.\nWe are currently living in a world with ever- increasing geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainties. The foundations and principles of the international order that usually guide our expectations are in some cases being called into question and in others being ignored. For a small country such as Brunei Darussalam, such unpredictability can be daunting and runs counter to regional and international efforts to build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\nIn order for us to achieve our goals of maintaining peace and promoting prosperity and sustainable development, we greatly depend on the consistency and stability underpinned by our adherence to international obligations and the rule of law. It is crucial that we all commit to an effective multilateralism that addresses\nglobal challenges, ranging from conflict prevention to economic uncertainty and environmental degradation. In doing so, we have to work together in order to ensure the relevance of the United Nations to all, and everybody needs to play their part in honouring the international frameworks and agreements that we have worked so hard to develop together.\nOne such agreement is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which helps us realize our vision of improving people\u2019s lives without leaving anyone behind. We are fully committed to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the Agenda, which we hope will safeguard the welfare of our citizens for generations to come. In our efforts to achieve the SDGs, it is imperative to understand and respect the right of each country to choose its own development path, including the adoption of legislation that is suited to its own national circumstances.\nA challenge for many developing countries in pursuing sustained economic development is posed by the uneven growth prospects amid many risks, including volatility in energy prices. Brunei Darussalam is no exception. To meet that challenge, we are concentrating on diversifying our economy. Underlying those efforts is our commitment to free trade and the rules-based multilateral trading system. It is critical, especially during these times of increasing trade tensions, that all can benefit from it.\nOur stand on that matter is evident through our participation in various platforms such as the World Trade Organization and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which support efforts to facilitate trade and investment. Our involvement in various bilateral and multilateral free-trade agreements is also a testament to that commitment. Such agreements help ensure market access and strengthen trade links with our partners within and outside the region. They are particularly beneficial to small developing countries because they also spur other forms of cooperation, including human resources development and technical assistance. All of these are vital as we prepare ourselves to take advantage of the potential opportunities brought about by the fourth industrial revolution.\nThat being said, we also need to remain mindful of the fact that efforts to increase economic growth should be aligned with our shared responsibilities to ensure a safe and healthy environment for our future. Climate change poses a clear and serious threat to humankind,\n \nand the Paris Agreement on Climate Change remains our greatest hope in addressing that global challenge together. Our  progress  in  meeting  the  economic and environmental goals under the 2030 Agenda is determined by our ability to maintain durable peace and stability. The work of the United Nations in preventive diplomacy, mediation and peacekeeping is key to the prevention and resolution of conflict and violence.\nIn that regard, we appreciate the Secretary- General\u2019s efforts to strengthen peacekeeping operations through his Action for Peacekeeping initiative, which will enhance global support for peacekeeping missions with a view to contributing towards sustainable peace. We truly value the selfless work and  sacrifice that  our peacekeepers show in securing a better world. Therefore, we are also pleased to join others in endorsing the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, as it underscores our collective investment in the success and performance of our peacekeepers.\nLastly, in building a more  peaceful,  equitable and sustainable world, it is important that the United Nations continue to promote the rule of law. On that note, we are particularly concerned over the unresolved question of Palestine. For more than half a century, Palestinians have been denied peace, justice and freedom. In solidarity with the Palestinian people, we strongly condemn actions and measures that blatantly violate their rights and dignity. Those violations run counter to international law, including the Charter of the United Nations.\nLike many countries, we have been alarmed by the developments in Jerusalem and the continued violence in the occupied Palestinian territory. We remain firm in supporting the call to protect the Palestinian population and to assist in the creation of a fully independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as  its  capital. It is Brunei Darussalam\u2019s greatest hope for Palestine that all States Members of the United Nations and other organizations will work together to realize the vision of a two-State solution, in full conformity with international law, the Charter of the United Nations and all relevant United Nations resolutions.\nOur unwavering commitment to international norms and multilateral partnerships is central to our efforts to advance our mutual aspirations of living together in peace and harmony. A significant part of that commitment is our continued support for the United\nNations. For more than 70 years, the United Nations has been the epicentre of our rules-based multilateral system, where its work, from advocating values of mutual respect to promoting development, has made an impact on people all over the globe. In spite of that, it still faces its fair share of criticism. The United Nations might not be perfect, but it is the best hope that we have for achieving the future that we want together.\nThe late Kofi Annan once said that we need to keep hope alive and strive to do better. For our part, Brunei Darussalam will continue to be a reliable partner and  a friend to all for the betterment of the United Nations and the world at large."

        "file_text": "Let me congratulate the President on her election as the fourth female President of the General Assembly during its 73 years of history. I wish to assure her of my delegation\u2019s full support in upholding her commitment to the United Nations.\nI   also   congratulate    Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on his firm and courageous leadership in promoting global peace, security and sustainable development.\nThe theme chosen for this year\u2019s session brings back some personal memories for me. Forty-four years ago, my father, the father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, stood at this rostrum and said\n\u201cPeace is an imperative for the survival of mankind. It represents the deepest aspirations of men and women throughout the world.\u201d (A/PV.2243, para.15).\nThe United Nations remains the centre of hope for the future of all people in this world of sadness, misery and conflict. My father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, devoted his life to the socioeconomic development of the people of Bangladesh. He did so at a time when 90 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line. Following 24 years of struggle culminating in the victory of our Liberation War, Bangladesh gained independence under his leadership in 1971. During that long period of struggle, he spent almost 14 years in prison. There were plots to assassinate him time and again.\nFollowing independence, Bangabandhu directed his strength to rebuilding a  war-ravaged  country with a ruined economy. The people had a great need for relief. Bangladesh set out on its journey as a least developed country (LDC). Yet, misfortune befell our people. Bangabandhu would lead the country for only three and a half years. He was brutally gunned down by assassins on 15 August 1975. Along with him, 18 members of my family, among them my mother Begum Fazilatunnesa, three brothers, the youngest only 10 years of age, and two newly wed sisters-in-law, were also killed. My sister Sheikh Rehana and I happened to\n \nbe abroad at the time and survived the mayhem. But we were barred from returning to the country. The military dictator who seized power at the time promulgated the Indemnity Ordinance, which blocked the possibility of bringing the killers to justice. We were denied the right to seek justice for the gruesome murders.\nI feel the pain and suffering of countless people around the world, like the Rohingya, persecuted and expelled from their homes. It is impossible to build peaceful, just and sustainable societies by ignoring such situations. The Myanmar situation repeatedly reminds us of the genocide committed by the Pakistani occupation forces against our people in 1971. During the nine months of our Liberation War, Pakistanis killed\n3 million innocent Bengalis. Two hundred thousand women had to suffer heinous torture and abuse. Ten million people had to flee their homes and take refuge in India. My father was arrested and taken to Pakistan. I was also taken prisoner along with my mother, two younger brothers and a sister. I was expecting my first child at  the time. He  was born in captivity. We  had  to spend our days in a damp, unhealthy environment. We are appalled by what we have seen in United Nations reports about atrocities committed against the Rohingya, who have now taken shelter in Bangladesh. Such atrocities are tantamount to  genocide  and crimes against humanity. We expect the international community, in particular the United Nations, to give due importance to the atrocities and injustice suffered by the Rohingya population in Myanmar.\nAs fellow human beings, we can neither ignore nor remain silent about the plight of the Rohingya. When my father and family members were killed, I was not allowed to return home for six years. My sister and I were compelled to live abroad as refugees. I can feel the misery of losing one\u2019s loved ones and of living in  a different land as a refugee. Therefore, I presented a five-point proposal at the General Assembly last year (see A/72/PV.14), with a view to  finding a  durable and peaceful solution to the suffering of the forcibly displaced and hapless Rohingya. We are disappointed that, despite our earnest efforts, we have not been able to begin Rohingya repatriation in a permanent and sustainable manner.\nMyanmar is one of our neighbours. From the outset, we have been trying to find a peaceful solution to the Rohingya crisis through bilateral consultations.  So far, three bilateral arrangements have been concluded between Bangladesh and Myanmar for Rohingya\nrepatriation. Despite their verbal commitment to take back the Rohingya, in reality the Myanmar authorities have yet to accept them back. The 1.1 million Rohingya hosted in Bangladesh are living in an uncertain situation. To the best of our ability, we have made arrangements for their food, clothing, health care, childcare and security. Many countries and organizations, including the United Nations, the Commonwealth and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, have shown solidarity with the Rohingya and extended support and assistance to them. I extend my appreciation and thanks to the international community\nAs long as the Rohingya are unable to return home, they should, as a temporary arrangement, be able to live in good and healthy conditions. With that in mind, we have started working on a new housing facility for them with all arrangements necessary for their education, health care and other needs. I call upon international organizations to join hands with us in that initiative. I also seek their assistance to help relocate the Rohingya to the facility. The Rohingya crisis had its origin in Myanmar. As such, its solution has to be found in Myanmar. We also wish to see an immediate and effective implementation of the agreement concluded between Myanmar and the United Nations. We want an early, peaceful solution to the Rohingya crisis.\nOver the past 30 years, Bangladesh has made its contribution to international peace by deploying more than 158,000 peacekeepers in 54 missions. A total of\n145 peacekeepers from Bangladesh have made their supreme sacrifice in the line of duty. Currently, more than 7,000 peacekeepers, including 144 women, are deployed in 10 different missions. Our peacekeepers have been acclaimed for their professionalism, courage and success. We pledged 23 contingents under the Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System.\nAs one of the original proponents, Bangladesh hoped to see a more robust and human rights-centric global compact on safe, regular and orderly migration. In the contemporary global context, the migration compact should be considered a positive step and should serve as a living document for protecting the rights of migrants.\nBangladesh stands firm against terrorism and all organized crime. We shall not allow our territory to be used for any terrorist acts against our neighbours or for any activity detrimental to their interests. Our zero- tolerance policy in countering terrorism will continue\n \nundiminished. Our whole-of-society approach has served us well in preventing violent extremism, human trafficking and the flow of illicit drugs. Bangladesh has aligned itself with the Global Call to Action on the World Drug Problem sponsored by the United States.\nSince 2009, we have been implementing inclusive and people-centric development policies. On  our  way to realizing Shonar Bangla or Golden Bengal, as envisioned by our father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, we remain committed to fulfilling our people\u2019s aspirations. The World Bank recognized Bangladesh as a middle-income country in 2015. Bangladesh is the forty-third largest economy in the world in terms of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). Our per capita income has increased from $543 in 2006 to $1,752 in 2018. We have achieved an average GDP growth of 7.86 per cent. Inflation has decreased by\n5.4 per cent. The poverty rate has dropped from 41.5 per\ncent in 2006 to 21.4 per cent in 2018. During the same period, extreme poverty has decreased from 24 per cent to 11.3 per cent. Our foreign-exchange reserves totalled\n$7.5 billion in the 2008/2009 fiscal year and increased to  $32.2  billion  in 2018.  Public  investment stood  at\n4.3 per cent of GDP  in 2009 and rose to 8.2 per cent  in 2018.\nPower-generation capacity has increased to 20,000 megawatts from 3,000 megawatts in 2009. We are building supercritical coal-based power-generation plants to ensure a sustainable power supply. In remote areas without transmission lines, the power supply is being ensured with the help of 5.5 million solar panels. Ninety per cent of our population now has access to electricity. With the launch of the work on the Rooppur nuclear power plant, we have moved a step ahead in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\nBangladesh is now recognized as a global development model. We have commenced our journey from being an LDC to acquiring the status of a developing country. The pathway for graduation is inextricably linked to our implementation strategy for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is integrated into our seventh five-year plan. We remain fully committed to implementing the SDGs.\nAgainst the backdrop of our current economic growth, there are now immense and large-scale business opportunities in Bangladesh. Foreign investors are being offered various financial incentives like tax holidays, double taxation agreements and duty-free exemptions.\nWe are setting up 100 special economic zones to help create 10 million job opportunities in Bangladesh.\nAs a follow-up to my role as a member of the High-level Panel on Water, we remain committed to implementing the outcome of the Panel, which was formed under the joint initiative of the Secretary- General and the World Bank President. I urge world leaders to take urgent actions on the proper appraisal and management of and investment in water. We shall be held responsible by future generations if we fail to do so. My Government remains committed to ensuring safe drinking water and sanitation for all through the achievement of SDG 6. As of now, 99 per cent of our people have access to sanitation and 88 per cent to safe drinking water.\nUnder our social safety-net programmes, 6.5 million elderly men and women, widows, destitute women and persons with disabilities receive regular allowances. Since 2010, students have received free textbooks from pre-primary up to secondary levels in school. A total of 354.92 million books have been distributed among\n43.76 million students this year. Vision-impaired students receive books in Braille. Children from ethnic minorities are given books in their mother tongues. Approximately 20.03 million students from the primary to the graduate level receive stipends. Stipend money for 14 million students is sent directly to their mothers through mobile phones. We have ensured 100 per cent enrolment at the primary level. The literacy rate has increased from 45 per cent to 72.9 per cent over the past nine and half years.\nOur home-grown, innovative socioeconomic development models have gained broad popular acceptance. Micro-savings programmes have been introduced for rural,  marginalized communities through the One House, One Farm project. The amount saved by beneficiaries in their individual accounts is matched by the Government. The Shelter Project is being implemented with the aim of ensuring that no one is homeless in Bangladesh. We are working to provide each of our villages with urban facilities.\nWomen\u2019s empowerment and participation have been a major factor in Bangladesh\u2019s outstanding development. We have promoted women\u2019s empowerment by enhancing their education opportunities and facilitating their political and economic emancipation. We have created opportunities for girls to pursue their education free of cost up to the twelfth grade in public\n \neducational institutions. At the secondary level, the ratio of girls to boys is 53 to 47. In early 2009, it was 35 to 65. Bangladesh is perhaps the only country in the world where in its national Parliament, the Speaker of the House, the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition are all women. In the present Parliament, there are 72 elected female members. Thirty-three per cent of seats are earmarked for women in local Government bodies in order to promote women\u2019s political empowerment at the grass-roots level. Approximately 20 million women are employed in the agricultural, service and industrial sectors. Women constitute 80 per cent of the 4.5 million workers engaged in the garment sector, which is our largest exports earner. Women entrepreneurs are offered collateral-free bank loans with a 5 per cent service charge. Ten per cent of the small entrepreneurs fund and 10 per cent of industrial plots are earmarked for women entrepreneurs.\nBangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. More than 160 million people now live in a land area of only 147,570 square kilometres. Despite our  resource  constraints,  we have made significant strides across a range of social indices. The maternal mortality  rate  has  decreased to 170 per 1,000, and the mortality rate of children under the age of five has decreased to 28 per 1,000. Life expectancy has increased to 72 years from 64 years in 2009. In the past fiscal year, we spent 5.9 per cent of our national budget in the public health sector. This year, investment in health has increased by 17 per cent. With approximately 18,000 community health clinics and union health centres operating, health care has reached our people\u2019s doorsteps. Thirty different types of medicines are being distributed free of cost. Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts have been intensified so as to reach the 2030 Agenda SDG target. As a result, tuberculosis-related deaths have decreased by 19 per cent in the past two years.\nBangladesh has also been playing a pioneering role in raising awareness about the needs of children affected by autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In order to further consolidate our efforts in that regard, a specialized cell is  being  created  in  the  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. A National Steering Committee and a National  Advisory  Committee have already been set up. Saima Hossain Wazed, the Chairperson of the Advisory Committee and a member of the World Health Organisation\u2019s Expert Advisory\nPanel on Mental Health, has been named a Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia on that issue.\nWe welcome the formation of the Secretary General\u2019s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation. The underlying premise of our vision for a digital Bangladesh is to promote people\u2019s well-being. The widespread introduction of Internet-based public- service delivery has led to a growth in job creation at the grass-roots level. The idea of a digital Bangladesh has taken shape. We have made our foray into the world of space technology by launching our own satellite, Bangabandhu I, making Bangladesh the fifty-seventh country in the world to have done so. It was in fact a dream of our Father of the Nation that we would one day reach outer space. The launching of that satellite helped us realize the aspiration he instilled in us when he set up the country\u2019s first satellite ground station on 14 June 1975.\nBangladesh is one of the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. Its topography, coupled  with its high population density, has made the country particularly vulnerable to climate-change risks. Bangladesh  remains  committed  to  implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We are spending over 1 per cent of our gross domestic product on addressing climate-change impacts. We are also promoting climate-resilient agriculture. Initiatives have been taken to increase tree coverage from 22 to 24 per cent in the next five years. A project worth $50 million is being implemented for the conservation of the Sundarbans, the world\u2019s  largest mangrove forest and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We have integrated our development programmes and our efforts to build capacity to combat climate change into a mega-project entitled Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. It is a water- centric, multi-sectoral, technoeconomic plan with a long-term time frame. It was developed bearing in mind the local geomorphology and global climate-change impact. Bangladesh is the only country in the world that has adopted such a long-term development plan \u2014 it spans 82 years.\nWe are shocked by the continued violation of the rights of the brotherly people of Palestine. That must come to an end. As Chair of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation\u2019s Council of Foreign Ministers, we shall continue to work with the international community to resolve the Palestinian question. There are three elements that play the most critical parts in advancing human civilization: peace, humanity and development.\n \nFor the well-being of human societies, we must continue to strive for humankind. Our main objective must be to serve the people and ensure their well-being. It is humanity and goodwill that can take us forward on the pathway to sustainable development. In a world faced with a myriad of challenges, our common interest, shared responsibility and sustainable partnership are our best bet for preserving human civilization.\nAll my life, I have been working to make a difference in the lives of my people. In the past nine and a half years, Bangladesh has achieved remarkable success  in various socioeconomic sectors. The Bangladesh that the world knew as a land plagued by disasters, floods, droughts and hunger has achieved wonders in maintaining international peace, managing disasters, empowering women and consolidating development gains. Bangladesh has now surpassed its neighbours in South Asia on a number of indicators. But our journey has not reached its end. It will continue until the day we can build a Bangladesh free of hunger, poverty, illiteracy and exploitation \u2014 the Shonar Bangladesh of our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu, may Bangladesh live forever!\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the Republic of Ecuador, and especially to Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, on her well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I can assure her of my country\u2019s full support for the fulfilment of her mandate. I would also like to commend Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his work and the remarkable results achieved during the seventy- second session, which have contributed significantly to strengthening cooperation among our States.\nI would also like to express my gratitude and reiterate our confidence in Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his ongoing commitment to peace and development in the world, and especially for the constant and multifaceted support for my country, the Central African Republic. I would also like to take this opportunity to pay a heartfelt tribute to the great African and world leader, Kofi Annan, who passed away on 18 August. I salute his memory and acknowledge his tireless efforts at the helm of the United Nations with a view to building a better world.\nThis seventy-third session is exploring an important theme. I  therefore  come  to  share  our  contribution in order to ensure that the United Nations remains relevant for all in the context of a global partnership and shared responsibilities for peaceful,  equitable and sustainable societies. In the twenty-first century, that goal requires structural reforms within our Organization, which for more than 70 years has made considerable gains that must be consolidated even if challenges and weaknesses still remain.\nThe aim of the current session is to promote reflection on how our common Organization should\naddress the new challenges facing the world and our societies today, such as terrorism, violent extremism, climate change, migration and poverty. The role  of  the United Nations through the combined efforts of Member States in multilateral action has led to major advances in global peace, security and development.\nThat was true yesterday for the emancipation of people through self-determination. It is still true today in the search for solutions to increasingly complex problems \u2014 violent extremism and international terrorism, the eradication of poverty, the persistence of conflicts in the world, lingering economic and social inequalities, the widening development gap among States and the massive violation of human rights. That is why my country, the Central African  Republic,  will continue to support the central role of the United Nations in preserving and maintaining peace and security in the world.\nThe global leadership embodied by the United Nations must be strengthened  and  equipped  with  the necessary tools to respond effectively to current challenges, while ensuring a better division of labour among Member States. My country supports the position of the African Union, which seeks Africa\u2019s full representation in all United Nations bodies, especially the Security Council, which is the main decision-making body of our common Organization in matters related to international peace and security.\nIt is high time to correct the historical inequality that continues to deprive Africa of a permanent seat on the Security Council with veto power. In the same vein, my country joins the African voice in supporting an increase in the number of members elected by the General Assembly to the Security Council. That will allow for a fairer and more balanced participation in that organ, which will ensure a more representative role in the promotion of international peace.\nThe rise of terrorism and violent extremism is a serious threat to international security. It seriously undermines social cohesion in our countries, exposes our populations to indiscriminate violence, generates a succession of humanitarian crises and thwarts development efforts.\nGiven that grim reality, Africa is showing its willingness to overcome regional divisions, pool resources and lay the foundations for a holistic and coherent approach that contributes to the development of a global doctrine against those prevailing asymmetric\n \nthreats. That is the best strategy for preventing and combating those scourges through specific responses adapted to our environment within the framework of the global peace and security architecture.\nAnother concern today is the problematic extent of the migration phenomenon. When well managed, migration can have a substantial positive impact on  the development of countries of origin and significant benefits for destination countries. When poorly managed, migration can have serious consequences for the well-being of countries and migrants, with a high probability of destabilizing national and regional security. That is why my country welcomes the holding in December of an intergovernmental conference on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration in Marrakech, Morocco, and hopes that the forum will lead to constructive proposals.\nOn an equally important note, our planet continues to suffer the effects of natural phenomena such as earthquakes, rainfall, drought, the rapid advance of the desert and global warming. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to encourage all States that are signatories to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to join efforts to preserve our shared environment and to ensure sustainable development for our planet.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to discuss the situation in my country, the Central African Republic. But first, I want to honour the memory of all those who have fallen in the exercise of their perilous and noble peace mission in the Central African Republic. I would like to convey the tremendous gratitude of the people of the Central African Republic to the entire international community for all its sacrifices to bring peace to my country.\nFor two and a half years, my Government has been working tirelessly to restore the fundamental values that underpin democracy, freedom and human rights. To that end, we are working to re-establish State authority by continuing to gradually deploy State administration and services in our provinces and to restore basic social services.\nOn the other hand, we deplore the continuing tragic and painful attacks perpetrated by the enemies of peace, who are driven by dark and selfish interests. They have been fuelling the bloody violence since the beginning of the year, both in the capital and in the interior of the\ncountry, with an increase in violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.\nNotwithstanding all those challenges, the Government has maintained the momentum of reforms in the security and defence sectors, where significant progress has been made, namely, the gradual deployment of the Central African internal defence and security forces and the implementation of the national disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programme.\nIn that regard, I welcome the commitment made by the European Union and our bilateral partners to supporting the training and bolstering of our defence and security forces, on the one hand, and to supporting the implementation of the national defence plan and the deployment of the Central African Armed Forces, with a view to setting up a garrison army and establishing control throughout the national  territory,  on  the other hand.\nWe are also eternally grateful to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), the United States of America, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Russian Federation and France for the material support provided to the Central African Armed Forces. Our ambition is to see them become truly operational and to contribute, alongside MINUSCA, to the immense effort to stabilize and restore lasting peace to the Central African Republic. But, in order to do so, allow me to reiterate from this rostrum our call for the total lifting of the arms embargo still weighing on our national army.\nThe reconstruction programme for the Central African Republic requires a coherent framework as embodied in the National Recovery and Peacebuilding Plan, which is being implemented and has already seen the Government and its international partners launch 21 projects regarding basic social services. That tangible progress is the fruit of the multifaceted, invaluable and commendable support of our strategic partners, such as the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Union and the French Development Agency.\nWe have also dedicated ourselves to the fight against impunity through substantial support for the rehabilitation of the national judicial system, which, among other things, has enabled  our  criminal court to hold two sessions this year to try common law cases. Moreover, the Special Criminal Court will soon begin its first investigations, while the Government\n \nhas established the framework for the Truth, Justice, Reparations and Reconciliation Commission.\nIn that context, one year since its operationalization in September 2017, the panel of facilitators of the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic has concluded two rounds of consultations and a meeting with armed groups to hear their demands for an inclusive dialogue. I am pleased to recall that the African Initiative is the one and only reference framework for all those willing to support the Central African people on the path to dialogue. In that regard, I continue to urge all the friends of the Central African Republic to generously assist us through robust support for the efforts of the panel of facilitators of  the African Initiative, whose accomplishments to date must be consolidated. My greatest wish is to enable my compatriots to resolve their differences once and for all in good faith and to strengthen the ancestral ties that bind them.\nToday, the Government and the people of the Central African Republic are firmly committed to strengthening the democratic process and the economic recovery in the country. Given the many challenges that beset our history, we will be patient but determined in our actions, vigilant and aware of the magnitude of the task that lies ahead.\nFor my part, I can affirm my determination to spare no effort to create the necessary conditions for the reconciliation and the reconstruction of my country in order to give back to the Central Africans, my people, the joy and the desire to live together. I extend our eternal gratitude to all our partners and to the entire international community for their ongoing concern for our well-being.\nIn conclusion, I hope that the international community will remain mobilized alongside the Central African people and work together with the Government for the recovery of my country. I wish our work every success.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my happy duty to address the General Assembly in this mythic and historic place, dedicated to peace around the world, on behalf of Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo, and his Government. We can never say it enough \u2014 there is no alternative to peace. It is our firm belief that peace is one of the most precious assets bestowed on us by God and our human intelligence. It is an invaluable treasure shared by all nations of the world, all peoples of the Earth and the entire community of States. We must never forget that it is peace that is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of this wonderful institution that is the United Nations. It is peace that is the essential motive for our regular and diligent meetings here.\nYet what do we see today when we take a panoramic look at our world and the new ideologies emerging in it? We see persistent and worsening tensions between States; a resurgence of nationalisms that we believed outdated; a normalization of sectarian discourse based on a fetishistic glorification of identity; the xenophobic contamination of certain social strata, ethnic and even racial intolerance and rejection of others, sometimes\n \naffecting entire populations; a questioning of the tremendous diversity of cultural expression that is canonized here at the United Nations and that constitutes the wealth of our world; the calling into question of multilateralism, despite the fact that it continues to provide a source of balance in international relations; and multiplying signs of rupture, particularly through the undermining of the founding and inalienable premise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the seventieth anniversary of  which  we  celebrate  this year.\nAt the same time, we see conflicts proliferating in various parts of the world, while senseless terrorism and violent extremism, often fuelled by religious proselytizing, have almost taken hostage vast territories that are then transformed into lawless areas, encouraged by the irrepressible vanity of individuals\u2019 selfish geostrategic calculations. As we can see, our world has entered a new period of uncertainty, perhaps even depravity. In some ways it brings back memories of the gloomy decade of the 1930s in the previous century. The proof is that the terrifying notion of wars between States based on identity has violently resurfaced in our vocabulary, even if it is masked for the time being by the euphemism of a trade war. That is all happening before our eyes, despite the fact that we all belong, without exception, to this divine and unique human race, despite the fact that we are all inhabitants with equal rights and an equal part to play on this shared and therefore crucial abode that is our planet.\nWhat can we say about the migration crisis and the horrifying toll of thousands of lives, often young lives, that have been claimed by the deep abyss of the Mediterranean Sea? How can we, the United Nations, gathered here in this peaceful and fraternal forum, peoples united in a community of destiny, stand idly by as our youth bleeds away on a scale unprecedented in history? How can we stand idle in the face of the tragic fate of a continent whose youth is being drained away before our eyes, depriving it of the vital forces of its valiant young people and the willing hands that are needed to build the future of its countries? How can we remain indifferent to such an enormous catastrophe, whose long-term consequences will one day catch up with us? How can we remain indifferent to so much suffering and grief? It is clear that we must act, and we must act together, resolutely and quickly, working to develop a United Nations that is relevant to all\npeoples, as the theme of the seventy-third session of the General Assembly states.\nIndividually and collectively, we must all work to build and preserve peace in the world, because conflicts everywhere, regardless of their nature, have the same consequences of destruction, frustration, injury and bruising. Conflicts are the result of public misery, and we must therefore work to resolve them. That is a moral requirement. It is precisely that moral requirement that has for years inspired President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo, on whose behalf I have the honour to speak today, in his tireless efforts for peace.\nIn seeking solutions to the serious crises that roil the heart of Africa, my country \u2014 which since last year has held the dual presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the Regional Oversight Mechanism of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region \u2014 has therefore in a way become the seat of the African debate, the place where summits of Heads of State and ministerial conferences, negotiations and consultations take place with a view to ensuring peace in the region and beyond. We issue strong recommendations to stakeholders and Governments to shoulder more responsibility so that the region can be permanently rid of armed violence and can focus on its own development.\nWith regard to the Central African region, the Republic of Congo would like to commend the latest political developments in our neighbour the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which will choose new leaders at the end of this year. We once again applaud the effective implementation of the electoral process in that country and call on all stakeholders in the process to prioritize dialogue, strengthen interaction and work to develop an appropriate balance so that all the elections can take place in peace. We are also deeply concerned about the upsurge in armed violence in the Central African Republic. We appeal to the rebel groups that remain reluctant to join the peace process being courageously led by President Touadera to engage resolutely and in good faith, while relying on the support of the panel of facilitators for the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation and other facilitating entities.\nWith regard to the crisis in Libya, in connection with which my country has received mandates from the African Union Ad Hoc High-level Committee on Libya to seek solutions, the Republic of the Congo encourages\n \ninitiatives that can contribute to the speedy restoration of peace in Libya and throughout the continent. We support the idea of holding elections in Libya as soon as possible \u2014 general, inclusive, free, transparent and credible elections \u2014 while we also consider it essential to create a context conducive to peacebuilding, including by organizing meetings for reconciliation and the disarmament of militias, so that the elections do not add further violence to violence.\nIn the Republic of the Congo itself, the Pool department, in the country\u2019s southern region, which until recently was gripped by a residual rebellion, has finally found the joy of peace. Thanks to the combined efforts of the State authorities at the highest level and international partners, a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities agreement was reached on 23 December 2017 and has gradually come into force. This is also the appropriate forum in which to commend the support of the United Nations, particularly because the Organization was able to quickly establish funding for our programmes for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants.\nFor the Republic of the Congo, the pursuit of the ideals of peace and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals for  the  benefit  of  humankind are essential commitments, including to  improving the integration of women and young people into decision-making processes and implementing actions aimed primarily at eradicating poverty in all its forms. It is obvious that we cannot hope to build prosperous and peaceful societies if women, who make up half of humankind, and young people, who are the builders of tomorrow\u2019s world, do not fully enjoy their legitimate rights. That is why today my Government is prioritizing those two sectors of the population, given that their dynamism constitutes one of the main drivers of our country\u2019s economic growth.\nA few days ago, from this very rostrum, the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called on the leaders of the world to delay  no longer in protecting our planet from the disastrous consequences of climate change. That call has particular resonance in my country, which, as the Assembly is aware, is located in the heart of the Congo basin forest. Our Government has been working for years to preserve the invaluable heritage of Central Africa\u2019s huge equatorial forests and the extraordinary biodiversity they contain.\nFrom this rostrum, I would also like to invite sponsors, donors, philanthropists, nature lovers, those brothers and sisters who have been favoured by fortune, all people of goodwill and all nations to join the peoples of the world and the Governments of the Central African countries in protecting the forests of the Congo basin in order to ensure clean and healthy air for our children, our descendants, all humankind and its offspring.\nFrom this rostrum and on behalf of my President,  I solemnly call on the conscience of  the  world  and  all in this Assembly to join in a sacred union, under the leadership of the United Nations, to give strength and vigour to the  valuable  instruments that  we  put in place following the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \u2014 the Congo Basin  Climate  Commission and the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin, which are designed to improve the preservation of the Congo basin forest, the world\u2019s second-largest lung, whose immense territory and exuberance are matched only by those of the Amazon. Those instruments are awaiting our generous contributions, which will serve the cause of humankind by protecting life on this beautiful and irreplaceable blue planet.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to congratulate the newly elected President of the General Assembly, Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, and to assure her of my Government\u2019s unwavering support in her mission to lead the Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the memory of the late former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, with his charismatic and measured approach, redefined the Organization and actively championed the ideals that characterized his ethos: peacemaking and peacekeeping, international cooperation and sustainable development.\nIn addition, by honouring the centenary of the birth of the great statesman and world leader, Nelson Mandela, we have expressed our great admiration and gratitude for his active promotion of the noble values of peace, justice and equality.\nCyprus fully endorses the theme chosen for this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. We fully subscribe to the theme, in line, of course, with the vast majority of States Members of the United Nations, since the essence of the theme reminds us of the founding principles of the Organization, in which millions of people and many countries have vested their hopes for a better future. The Organization emerged from the ashes of war for the purposes of maintaining international peace and security and respecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, irrespective of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief.\nThe order it proposes is based on multilateralism, collective action and international cooperation among States with sovereign equality. However, one might consider thinking that we have failed to uphold those values by asking how it is that we come back again and again, year after year, as a kind of ritual, to attest to the dismal lack of effectiveness for some and the attempts at embellishment of others for what is in fact our inability to fulfil the aims of the Charter of the United Nations. Why do the decisions of the Security Council in their\noverwhelming majority remain mere certificates that attest to violations? Why are international law and international agreements not implemented? Why do strategies and programmes aimed at creating better conditions for people who are suffering remain wishful thinking? When will we finally really take our destiny into our own hands, fully assuming our responsibilities towards our peoples and towards humankind as a whole?\nAs a leader of a small country that has suffered  for more than 44 years from blatant violations of international law, let me repeat the well-known causes that explain those unacceptable and disappointing results, registered at both the regional and global levels. I will dare to mention sad realities candidly  and honestly, in the hope that States and international organizations reconsider or make adjustments to their policies and actions with a view to upholding real hope for a better future.\nIn that effort and struggle we must ensure the cooperation of all, but more so of the States and the peoples who are the victims, those suffering from problems such as the primacy of a State\u2019s expansionist interests over the territorial integrity, peace and prosperity of other countries and peoples; investing in and promoting military industries and infrastructure by fomenting conflict for financial gain; standing by passively in the face of such violations of international law as the annexation of territories that fuels separatism and civil wars, so as not to poison relations and common interests among friendly countries; and some States\u2019 financing and promotion of terrorism in order to impose religious fundamentalism.\nWhile more than 20 million people in north-eastern Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen and Somalia face famine and are in need of urgent assistance, and while more than 820 million people, including 155 million children, suffer from chronic malnutrition, there are countries in which immense quantities of animal and plant products are destroyed for the sake of narrow and blind economic and commercial considerations. While child mortality and life-threatening diseases persist and the quality of health services is below acceptable levels, we continue to face inflexible policies and practices that emasculate the relevant authorities and prevent them from providing necessary medical care. Instead of tackling the root causes leading to the massive migratory flows of millions of people, we content ourselves with setting up immigration detention centres. While we have adopted\n \nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change to address that global challenge, specific interests hinder both the design and the implementation of domestic policies that could deliver on our pledge and commitments.\nAll of the those factors, in addition to an inability to effectively implement United Nations resolutions, have  led  to   unprecedented  crises  and   resulted  in a lack of credibility, trust  and  even  legitimacy  in our decision-making, bringing about the forcible displacement of millions of people, hunger and distress that intensify migration flows, create demographic changes and exert huge economic and social pressures on all countries or regions affected, human and drug trafficking, leading to millions of deaths, and the destruction of cultural heritage.\nDespite diverging aspirations and conflicting interests, we should rise to meet our shared responsibilities, reverse the policies of political expediency  that  I  have   already  mentioned,  adopt  a more proactive, targeted and results-oriented approach and address the  root  causes that have  led  to this unprecedented situation. We should intensify our efforts to make sustainable development a reality for all countries and regions in need, once  and  for  all, by establishing the political and socioeconomic conditions necessary for stability, economic growth and institution-building. At the same time, we should also work to confront the threats posed by ongoing conflicts efficiently, in order to achieve lasting and viable political solutions that promote regional peace, security and predictability and spare future generations from the plague of asymmetrical threats.\nCollective leadership, together with the primacy of multilateralism, is the only way to effectively eliminate threats to peace and security. We therefore need to strengthen our support and commitment to the United Nations and safeguard the  effective  implementation of its decisions and actions, based on justice and international law, which constitute the core and essence of the Organization.\nIn that context, we firmly support the ambitious vision   of   Secretary-General   Ant\u00f3nio    Guterres for reforming the Organization in a manner that corresponds to the needs of its Member States and meets the expectations of our peoples.  With  regard  to reforming the development pillar, we reiterate our full commitment to strengthening the capacity of the United Nations so that it can become more effective\nand transparent in its efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which represents an integral part of our efforts to help all people to live in dignity. In parallel,  we  must  take  further action to address States\u2019 vulnerability to climate change, particularly small island States, just as we  need to   put more emphasis on implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and accelerate efforts to that end.\nBearing in mind the ongoing unstable situations and conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Nigeria, Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Sahel, the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, of course, the still unresolved problem of the forcible division of my country, reforming the peace and security pillar is particularly important. We fully concur with the notion of the primacy of diplomacy in peacemaking and conflict resolution and the supportive yet catalytic role of peacekeeping operations. However, we must admit that the former is in jeopardy without the latter, and that in the absence of a negotiating process, the need for peacekeeping becomes much greater and, in many cases, indispensable. The  situation in my  country is  a meaningful example of that. Accordingly, while we remain deeply committed to adopting the necessary reforms related to this pillar, we strongly believe that each peacekeeping operation should be evaluated on its own merits, based on actual needs and threats on the ground. The risks involved are far too grave to allow for any experimentation in that regard.\nNotwithstanding Cyprus\u2019s membership in the European Union (EU), it is located at the epicentre of an area of extreme volatility and instability. Our quest is based on our vision and ambition of becoming a beacon of stability, predictability and synergy for the purposes of promoting shared prosperity and stability for all. To that end, and as a unanimously accepted honest broker with no hidden agenda, we  have  reinforced our historically close ties with the countries in our immediate neighbourhood, and, together with Greece, we have established trilateral partnerships with several of our neighbours, including Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. Those trilateral mechanisms constitute a fitting example of what can be achieved when countries with shared concerns and common interests join forces rather than isolating themselves. In short, they are a practical expression of effective multilateralism, fully in line  with  this year\u2019s  theme of shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. Accordingly, I want to emphasize\n \nthe partnerships are neither exclusionary nor directed against any third country. On the contrary, they institutionalize cooperation and dialogue in our region, particularly in areas in which there are comparative advantages, such as energy. In that regard, we warmly welcome the expansion of those trilateral formats to include additional partners in other specific fields for mutually beneficial collaboration.\nWhen talking about the importance of achieving peace and stability in our immediate neighbourhood and the means by  which that can be  accomplished,    I feel obliged to stress the significance and consequent multiple benefits that would result from a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem. First and foremost, a  viable and lasting settlement would  be in the best interests of the people of Cyprus, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, as it would fulfil their aspiration to live in a normal and prosperous European country, fully independent and free from any foreign dependency. At the same time, I remain convinced that resolving the Cyprus problem will undoubtedly have a very important collateral influence on achieving and maintaining a much-needed environment of stability and peace in the region. Last but not least, a resolution of this international problem, which has been on the agenda of the United  Nations  for  decades, will offer a beacon of hope and demonstrate that even the most intractable problems can be solved peacefully through the Organization. Unfortunately, as the peace process has remained at an impasse since the conference on Cyprus in July 2017, I am deeply concerned about the time that has elapsed and its consequences.\nTo state it clearly, only a viable and functional solution to the Cyprus problem, in line with the principles of our EU membership and the best practices of the democratic countries of the  United  Nations, can establish the conditions for achieving lasting peace, enabling my country to fully hit its stride and all Cypriots to live in a state of normalcy and work together for their prosperity and security. As I have said previously, I remain strongly and truly committed to achieving a solution on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the European Union acquis, and continuing the negotiations on the six-point framework that the Secretary-General has set as the basis for the way forward. The Secretary-General\u2019s  framework  and good-offices mission constitute the only path to    a solution.\nWe expect that Turkey, which has a key role to play in efforts to reach a settlement, will rise to the occasion, demonstrate the political will necessary for reaching a settlement and concretely contribute to regional stability. For our part, I want to repeat once again that we are determined to rise to the challenge of our historic responsibility and do our utmost to provide a peaceful future for  all  Cypriots and  the  region  as a whole.\nIn a fragmented and multipolar world, we have more than ever a moral, ethical and political duty to promote the essence of human civilization, unite our strength to maintain international peace and security and establish conditions that can bring prosperity and welfare to all. That perfectly matches the theme of this year\u2019s session, and I hope that by next year we will be in a position to be proud of ourselves because we have taken significant steps towards fulfilling that vision.\n"

        "file_text": "I am present here in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria. I extend my greetings to the President and the Vice-President of the General Assembly.\nI am the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria, but I would like to address the Assembly in Arabic. Why do I do so? For one thing, Arabic is one of the   six official languages of the United Nations. I studied Arabic at the United Nations Office in Vienna. Arabic is a important and beautiful language, as well as part of the important Arab civilization.\nI also learned in Lebanon during the years of war how people continue with their lives despite all odds and difficulties. That is the secret of life. There are men and women from Baghdad to Damascus who manage to just continue with their lives. I totally respect those people. All of us are the offspring of Adam. The offspring of Adam means humankind. In this Hall we have a voice, and we should use it to express the voice of those outside this Hall who are living in conflicts and wars, especially in the Middle East.\nAllow me to mention the German writer, Bertolt Brecht, who said that there are some in the darkness and others in the light. We see only those in the light; we do not see those in the darkness.\nI just quoted the German writer Bertolt Brecht, who spoke of those who are in the darkness and those who are in the light. We only see those in the light. Unfortunately, we diplomats often fail to make heard the voices of those who are in the shadows and in misery. Our diplomatic practices all too often favour fine declarations over real actions. I  even  dare  to  say that we indulge in a kind of dialogue of the deaf when we reduce ourselves to a ritual of reading out  our prefabricated notes. That state of mind reflects a loss of the sense of reality. We have lost the sense of any real exchange of views. When we speak, are we still discussing? Do we even know how to look in each other\u2019s eyes?\nAlbert Cohen, a connoisseur of the League of Nations, the organization that preceded the United Nations, wrote in Geneva his masterpiece Belle du Seigneur, whose main character is named Solal, a gentleman who works as the Assistant Secretary- General of that organization. Finally, that gentleman loses his post of Assistant Secretary-General at the League of Nations because he forgets his diplomatic restraint in the face of the persecution of  German Jews in the 1930s. Has anyone here ever experienced the feeling of losing face when confronted with injustice and indifference? The multilateralism we are celebrating here is a sophisticated form of diplomacy. We have a wide range of instruments: our contracts, our conventions and our declarations. But where is the effectiveness of that multilateralism?\nAllow me at this point to pay tribute to President Macron\u2019s statement to the Assembly earlier this week (see A/73/PV.6), which contains a very interesting reflection on multilateralism  and  the  rule  of  law. For the President of France, those two things are synonymous. However, multilateralism is often blurred in a merry-go-round of meetings of which certain well-to-do diplomats have made a comfortable, subtle, interminable game that is enriched with litanies and mantras.\nUnfortunately, we are content with this mantra when we talk about Syria and Yemen. We become intoxicated with words like \u201creconstruction\u201d, \u201cstabilization\u201d, \u201cconstitution\u201d, and so on. But faced with all that, the populations, the children, seek only to survive. They need bread, drinking water, a few hours of electricity and a minimum of security. That is why, beyond those fine phrases, Austria wishes to contribute, as other countries already do, to financing the demining of Syrian territory. And with regard to the greatest tragedy of our time \u2014 and here I speak of Yemen \u2014 Austria is ready to increase its humanitarian commitment.\nBut let us come back from the action on the ground to the beautiful Hall in which we find ourselves on  this beautiful Saturday. Multilateralism is based on a diplomatic approach to norms, and it is those norms that\n \nrequire us to condemn, in the name of universal values, the use of chemical weapons in Syria and elsewhere. They also demand the absolute rejection of biological weapons. In that vein, there is no reason why we should not categorically prohibit the production and use of nuclear weapons and explosives.\nDisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control are essential for global security. The fiftieth anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) reminds us of the key role of the rule of law. Despite some success, the NPT has suffered from inadequate implementation. Now, what is the law? It consists of binding rules of an enforceable nature. Like other international treaties, disarmament treaties are not of a moral but rather of a legal nature. We are convinced that if we wish to really move towards nuclear disarmament, the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is of paramount importance. My country, Austria, has been chosen as the seat of the organization responsible for the implementation of that treaty, and we are proud of that.\nThe destructive power of nuclear weapons has made it imperative that the legal prohibition of nuclear war be strictly observed in practice. We congratulate Latin America for creating the first international nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nWe all know that, according  to  the  Charter  of the United Nations, there is  no  just  war.  In  1945,  the international community set out to save future generations from the scourge of war. Unfortunately, the United Nations has not  succeeded  in  keeping  that promise.\nIn addition, the majority of  Latin  American States have, as Austria has also done, recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. That is a necessary condition for maintaining a credible system of international law. Similarly, Austria is a firm supporter of the International Criminal Court. We are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute this year. The establishment of a permanent independent  tribunal  for the prosecution of the most serious crimes was a historic milestone. We welcome the activation of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which has been in effect since July and is an important step in combating impunity. We regret, however, that the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court has\nbeen undermined by several agreements impeding the\nsurrender of persons to the Court.\nThe main  purpose  of  the International  Court  of Justice is to foster trust in the international legal system. Secretary-General Guterres spoke at length (see A/73/PV.6) about the broken trust that we face. The most recent example of the importance of trust and reliability in international relations concerns the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which  is politically but not legally binding. The JCPOA, negotiated in Vienna, was the result of effective multilateral action. It contains a set of political commitments and includes, importantly, an independent verification system involving the International Atomic Energy Agency. That agreement demonstrates the importance of pacta sunt servanda \u2014 agreements must be kept \u2014 which many of us recall from our international  law  studies.  That  is  a  precondition for mutual trust and confidence-building in the international arena. Preserving the nuclear deal with Iran is a matter of respecting international agreements and one, in the end, of international security. If one country that originally committed to the JCPOA can walk away from the agreement without other parties  to the agreement having violated it, mutual trust is weakened. Reliability is key to peaceful solutions of conflicts. That is especially true with regard to long- term conflicts such as the one on the Korean peninsula, where concrete and substantive measures should follow the first encouraging steps. We express our sincere respect for all those involved in that process.\nMultilateralism has also failed several million women worldwide, as have individual States. Gender equality is about more than legal provisions. It is about daily practice in our  countries  and  societies.  That  is why the fight against discrimination against and improving the situation of women and girls worldwide has been a long-standing concern of Austrian foreign and development policy. Our focus is centred on the women and peace and security agenda, the political and economic empowerment of women and the fight against gender-based violence, with a particular focus on combating female genital mutilation. More than 200 million women and girls worldwide are victims of such mutilation.\nTogether, we must stand up against that humiliation,\nwhich is a breach of human rights and an appalling\n \nviolation of the physical integrity of girls and women. In 2018, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs earmarked more than \u20ac1 million to help victims of female genital mutilation through surgical restoration, as their physical integrity can be restored. Here in New York, I had very constructive talks with the United Nations Population Fund and UNICEF for the purpose of joining forces to advocate for the basic rights and physical integrity of girls and women. We aim to do that not only through conferences and seminars, but also through practical surgical help, whereby help truly becomes effectual. Women and children are also among the vulnerable victims of human trafficking. Illegal migration provides daily illustrations of that tragedy, with which we are familiar in the North-South and East-West contexts.\nVienna has found its specific identity within the United Nations family, in particular in the fight against organized crime, corruption and terrorism. Next year, Vienna will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Office at Vienna. I am part of that generation of Austrians who  grew  up with the proud awareness of living in a United Nations city.\nWith this statement, I have  tried  to  depart  a little bit from the usual United Nations discourse. I have refrained from addressing every single issue dealt with by the United Nations system. However, I cannot conclude without endorsing Secretary-General Guterres\u2019 foremost concern, namely, climate change. The global energy mix continues to be dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal. Scientists are working on finding new forms of energy, in particular for transportation. Will we see an increase in electric and other types of engines? Innovation, market forces and political action will decide.\nIt is in the Middle East that the major oil reserves are located. The States of the Middle East were shaped by the oil business in the aftermath of the First World War. This autumn, we are commemorating the end of the Great War 100 years ago. Let me remind the Assembly that, with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, the new map of the Middle East was shaped by pipelines, in relation to which borders were subsequently drawn. The recent wars imposed on the Middle East were also fought for the sake of oil. Now Syria is a victim of the instability created by all those wars. A week ago, a ceasefire was brokered in northern Syria for the city of Idlib. Five national armies find themselves in a sort of\nstand-off among millions of civilians and thousands of terrorists, some of whom are European Union nationals, or, as we call them, \u201cforeign fighters\u201d.\nThe burning issue is how to move from that military situation to a diplomatic transition. The time has come to take courageous steps to launch such a  process.  We believe that there is momentum  for  creating  a new dynamic. We encourage the decision makers  from Washington, D.C., to Moscow, from Tehran to Jerusalem, and from Ankara to Damascus to  seize that very momentum. We have a historic chance, and, there is no other alternative \u2014 according to the Hebrew expression \u2014 than to sit down at the negotiation table.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Ambassador Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly. I welcome the fact that, for the first time in history, a Latin American woman is presiding over the work of the Assembly.\nSince the founding of the Organization, Mexico has demonstrated its willingness to help make the ideals that gave rise to its creation into a reality. As Mexicans, we are aware of our responsibilities as  a  nation  that is part of a community of sovereign and independent States. Successive generations have managed to build Mexico into a democratic and pluralistic State, a free and participatory society and a dynamic economy open to the world. At the same time, we have contributed to deliberations and action focused on the great challenges facing the international community in the quest for peace and security, the promotion of sustainable development and respect for human rights. Those are universal values that have inspired and guided Mexico\u2019s efforts to overcome the challenges facing our society.\nWith the commitment and cooperation of the three branches of our Government, various political parties, civil-society organizations and representatives of the various economic sectors, Mexico is moving forward towards improved levels of wealth and development. We have striven to strengthen our institutions and protect our society from the threat of crime and violence in the quest for a Mexico living in peace. We have worked to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable groups by reducing poverty levels and building an inclusive Mexico. We have transformed the Mexican educational system so that it can provide the children and young people of the country with quality education that will prepare them for a successful and happy life. We have removed barriers that, for decades, impeded full economic development, thereby fuelling a prosperous Mexico. We have taken an active role in finding solutions to international challenges, which is fitting for one of the 10 most populous countries, one of the 15 largest economies in the world, and a responsible global actor.\nMy country has made a sense  of  responsibility the watchword of its foreign policy. Mexico has acted responsibly in promoting sustainable development, which benefits everyone. For that reason, we have established an institutional architecture, in cooperation with the federal executive power, to promote the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Together with other countries represented in this Hall, we have\n \npromoted the annual assessment of the impact of rapid technological change, especially artificial intelligence, on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.\nThe implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a priority for my country. As an international community, we have a moral obligation to put its precepts into practice and meet even more ambitious mitigation, adaptation and financing goals. Mexico has acted responsibly in seeking for solutions to the challenges posed by migration. I welcome the progress that we have made in achieving the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Based on the new development paradigm, the Permanent Representatives of Mexico and Switzerland have worked over the past two years with States, civil-society organizations, international organizations and academia to establish the following guiding principles of the pact: respect for the human rights of all migrants regardless of their immigration status, shared responsibility and unrestricted respect for the sovereignty of States, among others. The upcoming official adoption of that instrument in Marrakech in December will allow us to rely on a foundational document for the international governance of migration.\nMexico has acted responsibly in promoting international peace and security. Following a hiatus  of more than two decades, Mexico has resumed its participation in peacekeeping operations. In recent years, we have contributed to operations deployed in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America and the Caribbean. Mexico also has made its mark in its struggle for the total elimination of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear disarmament. Accordingly, we initiated and supported the process concluded in 2017 with the negotiation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which Mexico ratified in January. We urge all Member States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Treaty without delay.\nWeapons of mass destruction are not the only threat to society. The illicit trade in weapons is one of the greatest challenges to national security that Mexico, like many other countries, has had to face. I say this  in no uncertain terms \u2014 given its serious nature, trafficking in illicit weapons is a scourge that we must urgently address. One important step to advance that struggle was the negotiation and adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty. The first Conference of States Parties to the Treaty was held in Mexico in 2014. We must now work on its implementation. The outcome of the 2016\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem was a watershed in the international drug-control system. Its implementation will allow us to move from mere prohibition to effective regulation that combines prevention, public health and human rights approaches.\nMexico has acted responsibly  in  the  promotion of human rights. We acknowledge that our country continues to face major challenges in  terms  of human rights, and we have therefore implemented specific public policies to address them. Mexico has maintained its openness to international scrutiny, as we know that it serves as a useful tool to strengthen our national legal frameworks and promote human rights in the country. In its efforts to promote human rights, the international community must continue to promote respect for fundamental democratic principles throughout the world. The usurpation of powers, the systematic violation of  political  rights,  the  rupture of the democratic order and the humanitarian crisis prevailing in some areas of the American continent are issues that deeply concern us. Mexico will pursue its best diplomatic efforts to ensure that democracy, peace and respect for human rights are restored in all corners of the continent. We will always seek peaceful solutions agreed by the citizens of those countries, in full respect for the principle of non-intervention.\nAs it has argued consistently in the past, Mexico today reiterates its call for an end to the commercial and financial blockade of Cuba. Mexico believes that solutions to problems must be found through dialogue and negotiations. I am convinced that the end of the blockade would benefit the entire region.\nIn the international arena today, we have seen trends that seemed to have been overcome and that in the past were shown to run contrary to the interests   of development, such as advocacy for exclusionary nationalisms, the return of protectionist trade practices and the questioning and erosion of multilateralism. Such policies promote exclusion \u2014 the political exclusion of minorities, the social exclusion of vulnerable groups, the economic exclusion of those less fortunate and the cultural exclusion of those who live or think differently.\nFaced with such worrying trends, I reaffirm before this universal forum the importance of multilateralism and international cooperation for Mexico. Experience shows that multilateralism is the best way to defend  the sovereignty and dignity of every State, while at the\n \nsame time contributing to the security and well-being of the community of nations. For that reason, all the Members of the Organization must confirm their trust in and commit themselves to strengthening it.\nSpecifically, Mexico calls on Member States,  first, to achieve a consensus for the comprehensive reform of the Security Council that would strengthen multilateralism, not create new permanent members and establish longer terms  for non-permanent members; secondly, to ensure that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which constitutes a true international social charter for the twenty-first century, becomes an effective global guide to ensure that no one is left behind; thirdly, to strengthen the human rights regime throughout the world \u2014 we are confident that the appointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights will strengthen that important pillar of the Organization; and, fourthly, to comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions to safeguard international peace and security. We are encouraged by the progress in the dialogue between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. At the same time, we reiterate the call for compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions on the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\nMy  country  is  currently  undergoing  a  period of democratic transition between Governments. Marked by unconditional respect for the political and economic freedoms of Mexico\u2019s citizens, the change in Administrations is taking place in an environment of certainty, order, economic stability and social peace. As I am just a few weeks from completing my term  as President of Mexico, this will be my last statement in the largest forum of the international community. During the past six years, I have found that dialogue, cooperation and an international system based on rules are our best option to achieve just, shared and lasting solutions to global challenges.\nBuilding a world of peace, friendship and international cooperation has never been an easy task. There are those who opt for exclusion and discord. There are also those who choose to be mere observers instead of true agents of change. Those alternatives are contrary to the spirit of harmony and universal fraternity that inspires the members of the Assembly. The Organization is the best indication that it is well worth fighting for a more peaceful, secure, inclusive, egalitarian, developed and sustainable world. The\nchallenges facing the international community compel us to remain faithful to the ideals that inspired the founding of the Organization and to continue building on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Let us all fulfil responsibly the commitments that our States have assumed individually for the benefit of every nation and, at the same time, of the international community as a whole."

        "file_text": "Year after year, Government leaders from across the  world  travel to this Hall in the United Nations in the hope  of finding a pathway to universal peace and progress, which has persistently eluded us all. The people of our nations \u2014 rich and poor, large and small \u2014 have long since stopped paying much attention to, or caring about, what is said here. For them this place is a talk shop where much is said and not enough is being done to change their lives or give them good reason to believe that a better life is coming. What they know is that they live in a world in which 1 per cent of humankind controls more wealth than the other 99 per cent. What they see is a world controlled by a few powerful nations that impose their will on all the others in perpetuation of a system of sectional dominance.\nTo the children of Syria, Palestine, Israel, Yemen and Afghanistan who do not know a life without war, without bombs, without conflicts and without violent confrontation, the promise of turning swords into ploughshares is a meaningless phrase. To the people in sub-Saharan Africa and many parts of Latin America and Asia, the World Bank\u2019s dream, emblazoned on its grand entrance in Washington, D.C., of a world free of poverty, continues to be a nightmare they relive every waking moment.\nThe fundamental undertaking by all nations, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations, namely,\n \n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\u201d,\nstands in stark contradiction to the reality of refugees from Africa, Latin America and war-torn countries, who are forced to flee their homelands to try to cross the borders of the rich \u2014 some literally in cages.\nWhy, then, did I travel to the United Nations? Why am I standing at this rostrum when I could be in my own country tending to its affairs and trying, as best I can, to improve my people\u2019s lives? I am here because none of the crises I just described exists in isolation. Each of them engulfs us all, and at this forum, at least, I can raise my voice for the disadvantaged and dispossessed, including my own people in Antigua and Barbuda.\nHistory has taught us that no nation should believe that its individual oasis of wealth, prosperity and advantage can continue to exist  and  expand if  the rest of the globe is a wasteland. The reality is that the world is a global neighbourhood. No place on our planet is distant any longer, and neither are the issues that plague it. The hopes and aspirations of all those communities \u2014 and, yes, their terrors, their torments and their fears \u2014 are shared by everyone. If they have not yet reached Member States\u2019 doorstep, at the rate we are going they are certainly coming soon.\nWalls around the rich cannot keep out diseases that are carried on the winds blowing from neglected pools of poverty. Migrants will not halt their determined trek from their homelands in search of better conditions until circumstances in their own countries improve. While the Governments and political parties in those countries bear a great responsibility to respect and uphold the human, civil and political rights of their citizens, the global community,  particularly  the  rich, has an obligation to contribute to the economic development of those countries. Human freedoms, like fragile plants, even in the purest air cannot take root and thrive in conditions of deprivation and dispossession.\nFor all those reasons, our  nations,  collectively and acting in a united way, must act to improve the human condition. It is an imperative. That is why the revitalization of the General Assembly is vital, urgent and important. For  instance,  without  the  inclusion of all States Members of the United Nations in the discussions on global financial reforms, there can be no real comprehension of the grave vulnerability of small\nStates to external shocks, high levels of poverty and high debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratios.\nA few privileged nations are making decisions that impact the livelihoods of billions. The exclusive clubs of the Group of Seven and the Group of 20 cannot repair the fragmented international financial system without taking full account of the circumstances and views of the majority of the world\u2019s nations, and neither can the European Commission, which now seeks to impose its own anti-competition, high-tax policies on developing countries around the world.\nLimits on participation limit ideas, innovation  and human development. Arbitrary rules set by unrepresentative bodies for their own narrow purposes have no legitimacy in the world. The enforcement of those arbitrary rules by the threats and sanctions of the mighty is not legitimate. It results only in grumbling and reluctant acquiescence that lacks enduring support. The might exercised by enforcers does not make their actions right.\nThat is why the General Assembly must be revitalized. Its revitalization  would  serve  to  give this gathering relevance and would help address meaningfully the indifference of the peoples of the world towards the Organization, about which I spoke at the beginning of this statement.\nThe special value of the General Assembly is its universality of membership and the fact that the voice of every Member State can be raised, but it must be seen to be more than a place for talk. It must be a place for action and for results. For years the General Assembly has been marginalized by the Security Council and by the notion that a small group of powerful countries should make decisions for the rest of the world. Where is the democracy in that type of behaviour? That erroneous thinking has crept into every multilateral organization. It is so in the World Trade Organization (WTO); it is so in the International Monetary Fund; and it is so in the World Bank. The General Assembly must become the principal organ of the United Nations system \u2014 the only system that every nation of the world accepts and to which they all subscribe.\nThat is what the Charter of the United Nations promised, and that is what nations expect. The failure to deliver on that promise has undermined multilateralism and encouraged the abuse of power by the powerful few and has frustrated people all over the world. Unless the General Assembly is revitalized and made relevant, the\n \nactions of the Security Council and other organizations will be endured, but not embraced; they will be accepted, but not respected; and they will be enforced, but not legitimized.\nDespite the risk of my call falling on deaf ears, I hereby make the call once again for a reinvigorated and relevant General Assembly. I recognize that it would not serve the interests of the powerful, who fear the expression of dissent and the call for political rights, rights that many of the powerful demand should exist in other countries, but I would be neglectful of my duty of care and my responsibility to the poor and vulnerable and to the silenced and stifled if I did not raise this clarion call for greater and fairer representation for all the world\u2019s peoples.\nAs the leader of my country, I put its interests first. However, I know that in standing up for my country first it would be foolhardy to stand up for my country alone. That would be a dog-eat-dog policy that, if practiced by every nation, would result in short-term gains for the richer ones, but ultimately in losses for all. My country would soon run out  of  friends, run out of foreign investors and, more important, run out of markets for its goods and services. The analogy applies to countries much larger than mine, even the richest and most powerful, even those who believe that they are invincible. For when they have weakened all others to strengthen themselves, to whom will they sell their goods and services and how will they maintain their high standard of living and increase their wealth? Humankind itself is our global community that provides all of us with enduring citizenship. Loyalty to myopic, nationalistic ideals cannot trump patriotism towards our common humankind.\nI recognize that today all nations  of  the  world are interdependent in the effort to stop the spread of disease, curb the effects of climate change, make our peoples safe from terrorists and organized crime, share knowledge and technology and have access to one another\u2019s markets to trade in goods and services, thereby improving the lives of all people. Today\u2019s world will be able to maintain and broaden peace, security and prosperity only through international teamwork. There is no other way. No one  nation, however  powerful, can go it alone. That is why my country supports denuclearization by North Korea and Iran. It is why we would like to see all countries eliminate their nuclear arsenals. Global peace will not be won by a balance of terror, and that is what pointing nuclear warheads at\neach other is all about. It is a balance of terror. It is a zero-sum game that is playing with the survival of our planet and all humankind. No one should be playing that game, no matter how rich or powerful they are. In my country\u2019s own Caribbean region, we have strongly advocated for a zone of peace. For too many centuries, our area has been the site of other peoples\u2019 conflicts and ambitions. We had no say in those conflicts, which have left our region with a long shadow of stunted growth, dispossession and underdevelopment. We want no more to be the theatre of the proxy wars of others. We want the chance to grow and develop, to claim a place under the sun and to make our unique contribution to human progress.\nFor that reason we welcome a recent visit to Cuba by the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the United States, Mr. Bob Corker, to talk about relations between the two countries. We understand that progress is never made in a straight line. There have been many zigs and many zags, but after five decades of imposing a trade embargo on Cuba the senselessness of that policy should be obvious to all. It is time to end it and to provide the Cuban people with the chance they have been so long denied to put their well-known talents in medicine, the arts, music and education at the disposal of all humankind. We again call on the Congress of the United States to abandon the outdated trade embargo of Cuba and renew the avenues of dialogue and cooperation that offer beneficial prospects for the peoples of both countries, and by extension to all the Americas.\nIn the same vein, we  urge all nations to recall  that the countries of the United Nations committed themselves, 13 years ago, to the responsibility to protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. What we did not do was to give any country or group of countries the right to intervene uninvited in the affairs of any other country. We certainly did not authorize military intervention in any way, shape or form. What we agreed was that there is a collective responsibility to encourage and help each country uphold its individual commitment to protect its own people, and we declared our preparedness to take timely and decisive action, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, to help them to do so.\nWe all know that, in the words of the Charter itself,\n \n\u201cNothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state\u201d.\nIn that connection, when  the  General  Assembly  at its seventy-third session once again discusses this matter, we must strongly discourage bellicose talk of military intervention in any State by any other  State or group of States. The responsibility to protect must not be used as political cover for vigilante action to justify intervention in any country. The encouragement of military interventions would mortally wound the United Nations as a legitimate and effective body. That is a prospect to be firmly eschewed. Therefore, when and if the United Nations decides that democracy and human rights have been emasculated by tyranny in any country, it is the United Nations collectively that must authorize and carry out any agreed action. In the words of former United States Republican President Dwight Eisenhower:\n\u201cIf the United Nations once admits that international disputes can be settled by using force, then we will have destroyed the foundation of the Organization and our best hope of establishing a world order.\u201d\nThe United Nations must always be a manifestation of the better angels of our common humanity, through which we must seek a world of security and freedom governed by justice and moral law. Together we must assert the pre-eminence of right over might and the general good over narrow sectional aims.  That  is why my country calls for a renewed commitment to multilateralism and a rejection of trade wars. Goods and services together represent more than 28 per cent of the global gross domestic product, but the escalation of trade wars will lead to severe disruption across the globe. No country will be spared and, incidentally, the worst affected will be those that wage those wars. That disruption has already started, and its effects are being felt globally.\nAlready, even though my country is not involved in any trade war with anyone, it is experiencing the downside of trade wars between our trading partners, as prices of our imports from them rise, pushing up the cost of living. The World Trade  Organization is not a perfect mechanism for solving trade disputes,  but walking away from it and tearing it down would  do nothing except to destabilize the world\u2019s trading system, which is fundamental to the well-being of\nall. It is up to all nations, rich and poor, to make the system work by improving it and by honouring their individual commitments.\nFifteen years after winning an arbitration at the WTO, my little country is still awaiting an acceptable settlement by the United States to honour its obligation to us. That is right \u2014 15 years later we are still waiting. The United States economy is 20,000 times larger than that of Antigua and Barbuda. The compensation for the injury to my small country is less than 0.008 per cent of one year of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States. The injury that was done to my country\u2019s economy now amounts to over 20 per cent of its GDP. No country can easily absorb that severe a blow, which hurts our economy, sets back our infrastructural development and constrains the provision of employment and advances in health and education. That my people have been able to survive that pain speaks to their resilience, of which I am extremely proud, but they should not be made to endure it.\nOf course, the WTO is powerless to enforce its own awards, and my country has no means to do so. We rely on respect for the international system, adherence to international law and the conscience of the mighty to do right to the weak whom they have injured. That is a struggle in which my country will continue to engage. We will not relent. And we will do so not in anger or  in enmity, but in calm and in comity until justice is achieved. We owe it to our small island community not to rest until justice is done. As I said before, we will not relent on that issue.\nIn the context of justice, the refusal by some countries, particularly those that are the worst contributors to greenhouse-gas emissions,  to  admit to the harmful effects of climate change and to take remedial action is an act of injustice. Small countries such as Antigua and Barbuda contribute the least to harmful carbon emissions \u2014 less than 0.01 per cent. Yet, along with other small States in the Caribbean and the Pacific, we are its greatest victims. The injury to our countries continues without compensation, causing our economies to decline, creating refugees within our States, scaring away foreign investors, escalating the costs of insurance and rebuilding and increasing the level of our debt. Those are the realities of climate change.\nLast year\u2019s hurricane season cost the Caribbean region more than $150 billion. To put that in perspective,\n \nthe overall economy of the 14 States members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) totals $80 billion. That means that the damage to countries within our subregion last year alone was almost twice the size of all our economies combined. Almost a year ago today, a CARICOM-United Nations high-level pledging conference was convened to assist Caribbean countries that were affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Billions of dollars  were  pledged,  although  they were insufficient to meet the costs. More important, unfortunately, less than half of the pledges have been delivered. Reconstruction is far from done; rebuilding lives and livelihoods will challenge us for some time to come. Where is the justice?\nThe Caribbean has been fortunate this year  in that we have so far survived  the  hurricane  season. We watched in anguish and with enormous sympathy and empathy the destruction wrought by Hurricane Florence on the Carolinas in the United States. We mourned the loss of lives \u2014 a pain we know only too well. What the destruction of the Carolinas this year and the ruin of Caribbean countries last year served to emphasize to us is that borders may separate nations but they do not insulate them from the shared dangers of climate change. Sovereignty and patriotism do not give sanctuary from calamity; disaster befalls the wealthy as well as the poor.\nThat is why we continue to urge for a global  policy dialogue that  integrates  the  environment  with development and that accepts the fundamental understanding that every country \u2014 with no exceptions \u2014 must play a meaningful role, within its means, to stop the persistent deterioration of our lives caused by climate change. The problem is global, and it requires a global solution. It requires the commitment of all. What the world needs is  a  recommitment to  the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, including a commitment to the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund.\nOn behalf of the people of my country, the people of the Caribbean and Pacific islands, the people who live in the eye of storms such as those afflicting the eastern seaboard of the United  States,  I  urge  all  countries to come to the table of dialogue and to stand by the agreements we have made and the treaties we sign. Our shared planet and our common humanity depend upon it.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, Madam President, I would like to join previous speakers by extending, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, our sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We are confident that your wisdom, diplomatic experience and skills will contribute to the success of the current session of the General Assembly. You can rest assured of my delegation\u2019s constant support and cooperation in that regard.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to commend your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, on his able leadership during the previous session of the General Assembly.\nWe live in an ever-changing world. Unprecedented levels of instability and uncertainty are on the rise in many parts of the world. Global challenges such as climate change, terrorism and extremism, large-scale conflicts, inequality, poverty, food and water insecurity, lack of education and economic opportunities, and unemployment \u2014 to name but a few \u2014 further affect the status quo.\nToday\u2019s global challenges exert pressure on the very foundations of the world order and the principles of international relations. They undermine the efforts of the international community to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals.\nUnder those circumstances, the theme for this session, namely, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, becomes very pertinent.\nI echo the words of our late former Secretary- General, the great diplomat and outstanding human being Kofi Annan, who said,\n\u201cWe should be asking what should we be doing in this changing world. The world is changing and the United Nations has to change and adapt with it. We cannot be static.\u201d\nAs a universal institution, the United Nations should continue carrying out its noble mission of coordinating the efforts of its Member States aimed at enhancing the resilience of the countries as they seek to respond to modern threats and challenges. At the same time, Member States should also play an active part in that process by meeting their commitments, undertaken in the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to restore stability and thereby to ensure development. Full implementation of the aforementioned milestone documents is required in order to address many of the socioeconomic problems that are the main drivers of extremism and terrorism.\n \nMy country believes that the response to the ever- increasing threat of terrorism and violent extremism should be comprehensive,  with  the  United  Nations as a key coordinator. The efforts should be  focused  on the elimination of the military infrastructure of international terrorism, on depriving it of political, military and financial support, and on preventing the use of information and communications technologies for the radicalization of minds, recruitment and propaganda messages for extremism and violence.\nIn order to discuss those issues, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, in close  cooperation with the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and some partner countries,  convened,  in  Dushanbe  on 3 to 4 May, the high-level international conference on countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism. We are confident that the Dushanbe  conference served as an excellent platform for constructive and fruitful cooperation by, inter alia, contributing to the achievement of a general recognition of the negative impact and consequences of the current challenges, exploring possibilities for strengthening partnership and cooperation at all levels, and exchanging experiences in countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism. Furthermore, in order to address the evolving transnational threat posed by terrorist groups and their affiliated member States, the United Nations should continue to strengthen and promote the effective use of the necessary tools and measures.\nIt is essential that we jointly search for ways to address poverty, the negative impact of globalization, and the prevention and resolution of conflicts. There  is also a need to strengthen intercultural and interfaith dialogue, mutual trust and tolerance. In that context, the United Nations remains a critically important platform for achieving consensus on the  main issues of international security  and  development,  as  well as for the coordination of joint actions on the part of the international community aimed at addressing the challenges and threats of the contemporary world.\nPeace is the main prerequisite for creating equitable and sustainable societies across the world. We therefore believe that stable peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through a comprehensive settlement of the crisis, which in turn will contribute to enhancing global security. We support international and regional efforts aimed at restoring and strengthening  peace and stability in the Middle East, including the efforts\nto further the resumption and acceleration of credible negotiations within the Middle East peace process.\nWe also  support  the  international  strategy  for  a comprehensive settlement and for post-conflict rehabilitation in Afghanistan. We need to strengthen our assistance to the Government of Afghanistan, especially during Afghanistan\u2019s  transformation decade (2015-2024). Urgent socioeconomic recovery  is a must for the development and prosperity of Afghanistan. Targeted assistance to that war-torn country, aimed at economic recovery, strengthening the social sphere and creating new jobs, should be expanded. To that end, the involvement of Afghanistan in the process of multifaceted regional cooperation is critical for the success of the efforts undertaken by the international community.\nWe are willing to take part in the rehabilitation of the social and economic infrastructure of Afghanistan by connecting the transport arteries of our two countries, by creating an energy bridge through the Central Asia-South Asia power project (CASA-1000), and by providing the Afghan population with essential commodities and by training specialists.\nWe are in the third year  of  the  implementation  of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The recent High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development has vividly demonstrated that, despite certain progress, there are early signs that a number of countries are not on track to reach the SDGs by 2030. It is alarming to observe that situation, particularly at the stage when  the  countries  have  just started incorporating the 2030 Agenda into and aligning it with their national development strategies. The mistakes of the era of the Millennium Development Goals should not be repeated. For that reason, there is an urgent need to step up efforts on all fronts aimed at achieving our ambitious goal, namely, to transform our world for the better by 2030.\nThe first step to be undertaken is to strengthen the means of implementation, especially for the developing countries. The mobilization of financial resources, including official development assistance, long-term investments, revitalized global partnerships, capacity- building and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to the developing countries, is needed in order to adequately attain the SDGs in a timely manner by 2030.\n \nSecondly, national development efforts  need  to be supported by an enabling international economic environment. It is essential to revitalize international trade and investments \u2014 the main engines of economic growth and development. Effective regional cooperation should also facilitate the achievement of sustainable development. As we pledged to leave no one behind in our collective journey, it is imperative to recognize that each country faces specific challenges in achieving the 2030 Agenda, in particular the most vulnerable countries, such as the African countries, the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing States. We need, therefore, to take into account the different national realities, capacities and levels of development of those vulnerable countries and scale up our assistance to them.\nWith that in mind, we supported and welcomed the Secretary-General\u2019s reform of the United Nations development system aimed at enhancing the United Nations contribution to sustainable development. We believe that the new changes will transform the United Nations system and will make it more capable of supporting the 2030 Agenda and delivering better on the ground.\nThe year 2018 was important for the water agenda, not only for Tajikistan, a country that actively advances that agenda, but also for the entire water community across the globe. We witnessed a series of milestone events, starting in Brazil with the eighth World Water Forum, then the launch of the Water Action Decade in New York, followed by the High-level International Conference on the International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d 2018-2028, which was held in Dushanbe, and culminating in New York with the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.\nEach of those  events  had  a  profound  impact  and made a significant contribution to the overall advancement of SDG 6 and other water-related Goals of the 2030 Agenda. For instance, the joint United Nations and Tajikistan International High-level Conference on the International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d,  2018-2028, held in Dushanbe from 20 to 22 June, brought together approximately 1,500 people from 111 countries. The Conference also provided a timely and necessary platform for elaborating recommendations in the run-\nup to the High-level Political Forum, where SDG 6 had been reviewed.\nAmong other things, the Conference helped to increase the attention paid to the water-related SDGs and targets at all levels and to the interlinkages between various Goals and targets; to strengthen cooperation and partnerships at all levels aimed at achieving the water-related SDGs; to better understand how water contributes to achieving sustainability and how the lack of sustainability impacts water resources; to discuss the role of the Dushanbe Conference in the implementation of the International Decade for Action on Water for Sustainable  Development;  and,  most   importantly, to discuss the importance of specific means of implementation, including monitoring, financing, capacity-development, innovation, technology, knowledge, information, data and best practices. It also helped to promote advocacy and networking and encouraged partnerships for action.\nEncouraged by the success of the Dushanbe Conference and in fulfilment of the mandate of resolution 71/222, which declared the period of 2018- 2028 as an International Decade for Action on Water for Sustainable Development, Tajikistan is going to submit a draft resolution  to  the  General  Assembly on the midterm review of the implementation of the Decade this fall. We sincerely hope that, based on the success of the Water Decade resolution, which was sponsored in 2016 by the majority of Member States, the draft resolution will also enjoy their valuable support this time.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me, on behalf of my Government and the people of Solomon Islands, to convey our warmest greetings to the President and the members of the General Assembly. We offer our warmest congratulations to the President on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I am confident that she will ably guide our deliberations during the current session. I assure her of my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation during her tenure in office. I also commend and thank her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajc\u00e1k, for his sterling stewardship of the previous session, and we thank him for his leadership.\nSolomon Islands also joins other members in mourning the loss of the late Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General and a proud son of Ghana and Africa. We acknowledge his immense contributions to the work of our Organization. The late Kofi Annan was truly a global statesman.\nI welcome the theme chosen for this session. It reflects the ultimate goal that this organ strives to achieve. \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d is indeed a powerful theme. It speaks of a united world, with both equal responsibilities and equal opportunities. It also speaks of the need to be united in order to achieve peace and tranquillity among all our nations and peoples.\nThe implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030 requires a unified global partnership, and the achievement of those Goals requires the concerted efforts of all stakeholders to  mobilize all available resources. Agenda 2030 recognizes that by acting together we can conquer the inequities that have befallen us today, be they man-made or natural. The Goals also reflect the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, which speaks powerfully of our mission to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. The Preamble clearly articulates the principle of universality for all peoples and all nations regardless of their size.\nUnfortunately, the world has entered an era in which the foundation and strengths of multilateralism are being challenged and undermined by unilateral State posturing and manoeuvres. We have seen a proliferation of insularly focused policies on the part of some countries, causing them to renege on their commitments under various international frameworks and treaties. The United Nations enables us to\n \nconsolidate our collective resolve and solidarity for the maintenance of international peace and security, promote sustainable development, advance respect for human rights and promote the rule of law.\nSolomon Islands reaffirms its commitment to achieving the SDGs by 2030. To that end, we have incorporated the SDGs into our national development strategy for the period 2016-2035. We also welcome the midterm review of the small islands developing States (SIDS)  Accelerated  Modalities  of  Action  Pathway. It is my hope that the outcomes of the review will provide the impetus needed to reinvigorate the special case for SIDS going forward. The review should also ensure that all partners and stakeholders, together with SIDS, more effectively address the challenges faced by SIDS and take full advantage of opportunities through genuine and durable partnerships. Solomon Islands acknowledges that achieving the SDGs  will  be an arduous and challenging task. However, it is a path that we must trek. We welcome all the assistance and support we have received from our development partners towards that cause.\nThis year Solomon Islands met two of the three criteria for graduation from the status of a least developed country (LDC) for the second consecutive time. The Committee for Development Policy recommended that Solomon Islands graduate from the list of LDCs. The Economic and Social Council has also recommended that this organ consider and endorse our graduation accordingly.\nWhile my Government appreciates  the report  and its recommendations, I must point out that, as a post-conflict State, Solomon Islands will require the development of appropriate prudent macroeconomic and financial policies in order to maintain the threshold indicators upon which the recommendation for graduation is premised. It is therefore my fervent hope that the Assembly will grant Solomon Islands an opportunity to properly assess the potential impacts  of LDC graduation on the key sectors that sustain our economy. A predictable and workable strategy that would put us on a continued upward trajectory will need to be developed as well. I call on the United Nations system to support us in those assessments and in the development of appropriate strategies that could assist us to move forward boldly and with confidence.\nThe Solomon Islands Government respects the process of graduation, which is based on an agreed\nrules-based system, and we will endeavour to graduate from the LDC status. However, any appropriate and relevant assessment undertaken of the country must  be well-conceived, thorough and consultative. As Members States are aware, the graduation of SIDS from LDC status will not improve the problem of our vulnerabilities. In that connection, we are pleased to know that a special task force has been established to ensure a smooth transition of SIDS from LDC status.\nWhile we in Solomon Islands are not subject to threats of an armed invasion, we are nevertheless continuously being invaded by a common enemy, one that the international community calls climate change. Climate change is now the greatest threat facing humankind. For us in the Pacific islands that threat is existential. The resulting climate-change-related extreme weather events mean that Solomon Islands \u2014 like other  Pacific island countries and, as we have just heard,  the Caribbean \u2014 is increasingly susceptible to natural disasters of great severity. The threat of sea-level rise, as well as the inundation and salination of arable land and the destruction of biodiversity, partially caused by a warming ocean and acidification, are elements that give rise to food-security concerns, and increase the risk of potential conflicts.\nIn the light of that threat, Solomon Islands calls for collective global leadership on climate change action and strengthened commitment to achieving positive outcomes during the  twenty-fourth  session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is to be held in Katowice, Poland, this year. Solomon Islands joins other Pacific island States in strongly urging the largest emitters of greenhouse gases to take urgent actions to reduce those harmful emissions: reduce now, or regret later. In the ongoing dialogue on climate challenge, appropriate financial support to SIDS to address their losses and the damage resulting from the destructive effects of climate change must be seriously considered.\nIn our efforts to reduce our reliance on fossil  fuels and meet our intended nationally determined contributions, Solomon Islands remains committed to transitioning to the use of renewable energy. On behalf of my Government and the people of Solomon Islands, I extend our gratitude to our partners, including the World Bank, the Green Climate Fund, the Economic Development Cooperation Fund of Korea, the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and the\n \nAsian Development Bank, for their financial assistance and support for the Tina River hydrodevelopment project. When completed, that project will provide approximately 80 per cent of the power needs of Honiara, our capital. I also acknowledge the bilateral assistance provided by the Governments of Italy, Spain, Austria and Luxembourg to the Pacific small island developing States, including Solomon Islands, to support renewable energy projects. We look forward to continuing those partnerships in the coming years.\nAdequate and quality infrastructure is a prerequisite for positive economic and inclusive growth. Investment in infrastructure projects positively impacts a majority of the population and enhances accessibility to goods and services, both private and public. In that connection, Solomon Islands is grateful to the Government and the people of Japan for their assistance in implementing the transformative development of major infrastructure, such as the Honiara city main roads, the Honiara seaport and the proposed upgrade of Honiara International Airport. The opening of the second international airport, in Munda, and the undersea fibre-optic cables are also game-changing infrastructures. The people and the Government of Solomon Islands are grateful for that valuable assistance from Australia and New Zealand.\nSolomon Islands has benefited from South-South cooperation on capacity-development programmes with countries such as Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Cuba, including the potential to explore other innovative opportunities such as pharmaceutical solutions. The people of Solomon Islands are forever grateful to all of our development partners for their genuine and durable partnerships. We will collaborate and increase efforts going forward.\nAs a large ocean State, the issue of the conservation and proper management of ocean resources is an important priority for Solomon Islands. We will actively engage on matters concerning the management of oceans. With regard  to  oceans  management  on the high seas, my Government welcomes the recent first intergovernmental conference to negotiate an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. A successful outcome in the form of a fair and equitable framework will again prove the relevance of the Organization and its convening powers.\nAt the regional level, Solomon Islands subscribes to the Blue Pacific initiative, which sets the context for the development of our regional priorities. We believe that maintaining the well-being of the oceans should be a key priority, as acknowledged in SDG 14. The restoration of fish stocks, the implementation of science-based management measures and monitoring, control and enforcement are but some of the measures that Solomon Islands is promoting through domestic and regional arrangements.\nAt the national level, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that we are in the final stages of developing an ocean policy that will rationalize and enhance the coordination and implementation of all ocean-related legislation and policies. The development of the national policy is a voluntary commitment that we announced at last year\u2019s Ocean Conference.\nSecurity concerns have become more complex. They now involve activities beyond the traditional definitions. Some of them now include new threats such as climate change, cybercrimes and transnational organized crime, among others. It is therefore now more important than ever that we work more closely and collectively with the international community to address those security concerns and threats.\nThis year we witnessed constructive engagement towards the better management of relations on the Korean peninsula. The United Nations must continue to ensure that conflict prevention and resolution remain a central plank in its work, as mandated by the Charter of the United Nations.\nSolomon Islands recognizes that stability in the Middle East is critical to world peace. A peaceful Middle East will lead to a prosperous world. Solomon Islands also continues to call for the peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and supports a two- State solution.\nIn the Pacific, security concerns are driven by external factors, human security and climate-change challenges. In recognizing the importance of our changing security landscape, the Pacific Islands Forum leaders undertook to build on the positive platform established by the Biketawa Declaration. That culminated in our adoption, earlier this month, of the Boe Declaration at the recent Pacific Islands Forum summit held in Nauru. As we continue to work towards the goal of global peace, the need to actively engage in peacekeeping remains.\n \nAlthough small, Solomon Islands is contributing to the achievement of global peace and security through its participation in the United Nations peacekeeping programme. So far, Solomon Islands has contributed\n12 officers to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan. Solomon Islands is committed to increasing its participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Cognizant of the important role of United Nations peacekeeping missions, we call on Member States to work collectively to ensure that the sustainability of United Nations programmes is not undermined by funding shortfalls. Having benefited from the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, my country values the importance of peacekeeping missions.\nAdequate resources are required in order to sustain peace. I am sure that the international community also recognizes that. In that connection, Solomon Islands has benefited from the Peacebuilding Fund, approved by the Peacebuilding Commission in November 2017. Through the resources provided under the Peacebuilding Fund, we have been able to facilitate dialogue involving a wide range of stakeholders on key issues, including land reform, rural development, border issues and the participation of youth and women.\nRecognizing the complex and ever-changing global-security landscape and realities, Solomon Islands reiterates the call for the reforms of the Security Council to be inclusive, by expanding the focus of the Council to non-traditional security priorities. Small island developing  States must  have  a  voice  through a dedicated seat in the non-permanent membership category in the Council.\nThe biggest threat facing the Pacific islands,  apart from climate change, is the threat caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Approximately 70 to 80 per cent of all deaths in the Pacific can be attributed to NCDs, with many of those deaths being premature. In the Pacific, including in Solomon Islands, the high prevalence of NCDs translates into an economic burden on health-care systems. Two thirds of the beds in the National Referral Hospital in Honiara, our capital, are occupied by NCD patients. The burden that NCDs poses on the productivity of the people of Solomon Islands and the opportunities forgone in order to provide care for NCD patients make that issue a key socioeconomic concern for an economy with a small human-resource base. The international community has already acknowledged, in the Samoa Pathway, the\nchallenges posed by NCDs to small island developing States. Now is the time for action.\nWhile we speak of leaving no one behind, we still close our doors to Taiwan and continue to contradict our own principles by leaving Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people behind. The implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals requires a unified global partnership. Taiwan is ready, willing and able to engage in, and contribute to, the wide range of substantive United Nations programmes for the welfare of humankind. Solomon Islands continues to call for the participation of Taiwan in United Nations specialized bodies, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Taiwan is the twenty-second-largest economy in the world and, as such, Taiwan should be part of global solutions in the various international frameworks. I believe that Taiwan has a lot to contribute through its experience and technological capability. If we are to focus on shared responsibility and promote peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, we should give Taiwan and its 23 million people a chance. Despite the contributions made by Taiwan to the well-being of the citizens of the globe, we continue to ignore the right of Taiwan to self- determination. The time has come for the Assembly to give due recognition to Taiwan as a legitimate member of the family of nations.\nIt is important that the administering Powers of non-self-governing territories and all the relevant organizations honour their commitments made under the Charter and the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and  Peoples. To that end and in accordance with the 1998 Noum\u00e9a Accord, Solomon Islands welcomes the free and fair referendum to be held in New Caledonia on 4 November. Solomon Islands reaffirms that human rights principles are universal, indivisible and interrelated  and  must be treated in a fair manner. All States have the moral duty and responsibility to uphold, respect and promote human rights and, where necessary, take preventive, protective and punitive measures against human rights abuses and violations.\nSolomon Islands recognizes and respects Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty over its territorial boundaries. My Government commits to working with the Government of Indonesia on areas of mutual interest, including human rights concerns in Papua and West Papua.\n \nSolomon Islands is committed to the principles of good governance and transparency. We have passed  an anti-corruption act, which aims to eliminate the scourge of corruption from all levels of our society. In addition, our Parliament has passed a whistle-blower protection act, thereby giving due protection to those who bring issues of corruption to the attention of the relevant authorities. Solomon Islands is also committed to democratic principles and processes. We are equally committed to the holding of free and fair elections in early 2019.\nSolomon Islands is an ardent believer in collective action. We are staunch supporters of multilateralism. As such, we stand  in  solidarity  with  all  members  of the Assembly \u2014 the pinnacle of multilateralism. Without the United Nations, we would not, as a small island country, be able to be heard. Other louder  voices would drown us out. Our expectations from the Organization remain high. As such, adequate resources for programmes and projects that will have an impact on citizens are needed. The United Nations has flaws, but Solomon Islands continues to feel the impact of the power of working together on global issues that are championed by the United Nations. We believe that the principles and values upon which the United Nations was founded remain relevant.\nMaking the United Nations relevant to all people is not just about standing up and talking about it  in  the General Assembly Hall. It is incumbent upon us all to be seen as making the United Nations relevant to all peoples in the actions that we take individually and collectively.\n"

        "file_text": "There once was a widow who suffered an injustice. She went to a judge and told him, \u201cJudge, I have suffered an injustice. Give me justice.\u201d The judge did nothing, so the next day she went to his office. Still he did nothing, so she went to his house during breakfast time and knocked on the door and said, \u201cJudge, give me justice.\u201d Still nothing happened. Finally, she waited for him at night before dinnertime and still he would not see her. So, she went at midnight and knocked on his door and woke him up. Finally, the judge went out and told her, \u201cYou know, ma\u2019am, I do not fear God, nor do I fear man, but because of your persistence, I will give you justice.\u201d\nWe all grew up with stories, anecdotes and parables \u2014 stories that give us hope, build our character and spark our determination to change the world. We are told those stories at home, in schools and in places\nof worship. Thus, we come out of adolescence and enter adulthood with an idealism that makes us convinced that we can change the world, that we are here to unite and not to divide, that we are here to heal and not to hurt.\nThat is the same spirit of idealism that we feel the first time we enter the United Nations. Unfortunately, as time goes by, many, if not most, of us are changed by the world. We become victims of pragmatism rather than champions of idealism. As things get complicated and struggles get more difficult, we are tempted to simply continue doing what is already being done and accept that we cannot solve the problem. When that happens, we settle for a statement from the majority rather than a broad consensus on how to actually solve the problem.\nThe story reminds us that persistence  is  good, but it does not mean that we should be repetitive and simply keep doing the same thing. Albert Einstein defined stupidity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Certainly there is no stupidity in the United Nations, yet a  tendency  to just keep doing the same thing seems to plague us all. Trying new things is a challenge. It might or might not work, but we should not be afraid of trying, nor should we be afraid of failing. What we should fear is stagnation \u2014 that we as a community of nations end up accepting failure and making ourselves feel better by doing something, even if that something is precisely the same thing that failed to address the issues or solve the problems in the first place.\nThe good news is that there is persistence in what we call hope and idealism, in the aspiration of wanting to change the world. We teach our children to love God and to love our neighbour. But do we actually practice what we preach? So much inhumanity around the world has been done in the name of God, and so little is being done at times for our neighbours.\nWe live in a world that is fast becoming bigger,  but also constantly getting smaller. From families to clans, to tribes to a federation of tribes that we call a nation, now we are but one global village. And with tools like the Internet and  social  media,  everything is known and communicated in real time. Nowadays we are all neighbours, all members of the same global community. We rise up together; we suffer together. Being connected to each other all the time has transformed the world into a global community, and we are all citizens of this world.\n \nToday, our social contract is no  longer  confined to our nation State. We should therefore exert efforts to connect, to emphasize commonalities and not differences, to think less that we are Filipinos, Americans, Chinese, French or Russians, and to think of ourselves more as global citizens, the people of the United Nations. Yes, it is true that we need not always act with a united front, and we  do  not  always  have  to act as a community. But neither can we ignore the fact that there are many problems that can be solved only by a united global community. These can be issues relating to protecting the environment, extreme weather conditions, poverty and inequality, rule of law, countering terrorism or violent extremism: those are problems or challenges that we can only solve together. Together we can find pragmatic idealism, which will give us hope and the momentum to do more.\nIt  is written: \u201cLove thy neighbour\u201d. Migration is  a reality. It is a fact. It is something that will continue to exist and even to grow. Issues relating to migration cannot be swept under the rug, but should be discussed openly, frankly and thoroughly. The global compact for migration is a huge step in the right direction, and that huge step will be even bigger if we can get everyone on board.\nAgain, \u201cLove thy neighbour\u201d, we are told. That seems like a simple command, and yet in a complex world it is sometimes hard to carry out or implement. That is why Filipinos thank Pope Francis, and we thank Secretary-General Guterres and all the countries thathave led and stood by the global compact. We thank migrants around the world for inspiring us to have the first compact negotiated at the intergovernmental level to cover, in a holistic and comprehensive manner, all dimensions of international migration.\nThe Philippines, under the leadership of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, is one with the United Nations in being uncompromising on the issues of the rule of law, just and equitable peace, which leads to order, development and prosperity, and the protection of each and every human being\u2019s rights. As a sovereign and democratic country led by a duly elected President, we are on track to salvage our deteriorating country from becoming a narco-State or a State held hostage by the rich and powerful, who ignore the plight of the poor, powerless and marginalized.\nThe hunger for change, peace, and law and order\nis genuine. There is passion to improve our economy,\nso that the more than 10 million Filipinos abroad can choose whether to work at  home  or  abroad and  not be forced by poverty or the lack of quality jobs to go abroad to find high-paying jobs at the cost of leaving their country and separating from their families. Those who stay at home can, at the very least, live a safe and comfortable life.\nWe may somehow and sometimes differ in how we express ourselves; yet that should not be interpreted  as turning our backs on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On the contrary, the Philippines and President Duterte are instituting all of those reforms so as to be able to protect the rights of every single Filipino and every single human being living in the Philippines \u2014 yes, the rights of all Filipinos and all human beings, if that is at all possible. But in cases where we have to choose between protecting the rights of a law-abiding citizen and the law enforcer versus the drug lord or criminal who seeks to kill and destroy, it is clear that we will protect the former \u2014 the law enforcer and the law-abiding citizen. Would Members of the United Nations not do the same? Which country, which leader would not do the same? Who would not protect their citizens and their law enforcers?\nChallenges will always be there, but so will hope! Hope leads to faith, and faith combined with action produces miracles. The United Nations is the place, the venue of great opportunity for adding action to our faith and for changing the world for the better. That is, of course, provided we can transcend our personal and sometimes national interest for the interest of the global community or, simply put, work for the greater good. Faith without action is dead. The United Nations is not a place to bury our dead; it is a place to rise up, to resurrect our hopes and to dream of a better world.\nThe President of the General Assembly, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, provides us with hope and something to aspire to, as seen in this year\u2019s theme: \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. Making the United Nations relevant to all is difficult. It is a dream; yet it is a dream worth fighting for. The Filipino people will remain persistent in our quest for peace, order, development and prosperity, and in the  quest for a safe and comfortable life for all those living in the Philippines. We will continue to have faith but will add actions to our faith, and we will continue to love\n \nour nation and not only preach but actually do what  we preach.\nAnd finally, we would like to close our statement by expressing our sincere and profound gratitude to all the countries and peoples that have assisted us, stood with us and lifted us up when we needed it most. God bless all present. God bless all the peoples of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, allow me to congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I look forward to a successful outcome of the session under her able stewardship.\nPeace and development is the common desire of our times and constitutes the main objective of the United Nations, defining all of its activities. Many countries around the world concentrate their efforts on achieving peace and development, but such efforts are still faced with serious challenges. During the past year, we have witnessed greater tension in overall international relations, with peace being threatened and development being deterred in many parts of the world owing to the \u201cpower does it all\u201d attitude of unilateralism. Such a situation requires that the role of the United Nations be even further enhanced.\nIt is on the Korean peninsula that the most tangible trend towards peace and development was newly created this year. In April, Comrade Kim Jong Un, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, put forward a new strategic line of concentrating all efforts on socialist economic construction.\nSince we have sufficiently consolidated our national defence capabilities and war deterrence so as to cope with the several-decades-long nuclear threats against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, we now must concentrate all of our efforts on the historic task of building the economy. Our Government\u2019s policy\n \nline of focusing on the economy requires a peaceful\nenvironment above all else.\nComrade Chairman Kim Jong Un has actively participated in summit-level diplomatic activities with a firm determination to turn the Korean peninsula into a land of peace, free of both nuclear  weapons and nuclear threats. He thereby made an important breakthrough in improving North-South relations and relations between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States, as well as in revitalizing friendly and cooperative relations with neighbouring countries, thus marking a turning point and a dramatic easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula and the region as whole. Peace and security in the region will be consolidated and that, in turn, will lead to world peace and security \u2014 to the benefit of all States Members of the United Nations.\nThe fact that representatives of numerous countries have been unanimous in supporting and welcoming, from this rostrum, the current direction of developments on the Korean peninsula clearly shows that the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s strategic choice and its sincere efforts to pursue that choice are fully aligned with the common interests and desires of the international community.\nThe key to consolidating peace and security on  the Korean peninsula is to thoroughly implement the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States Joint Statement, adopted in June at the historic bilateral summit held in Singapore. The Joint Statement contains all of the issues of principle regarding eventual solutions to the issues on the Korean peninsula, such as terminating the decades-long hostility between the two countries and establishing new relations between them, thus building a robust peace regime on the Korean peninsula, realizing  the complete  denuclearization of the peninsula and promoting humanitarian work between the two countries.\nOnce the Joint Statement has been implemented, the current trend towards d\u00e9tente will turn into durable peace, and the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will also be achieved. As a result, the Korean peninsula, currently the most intense global hotspot, will become a cradle of peace and prosperity that contributes to security in Asia and the rest of the world.\nThe commitment of the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to the full implementation of the Joint  Statement is unwavering. The\nprimary task in ensuring the effective implementation of the Statement must be to break down the barrier of mistrust between the two countries that has existed for several decades. To that end, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States should devote great efforts to building trust as a top priority. The implementation of previous agreements reached in various dialogues and negotiations between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States ended in failure because the level of mistrust between them was too high and resulted in a general lack of confidence.\nIt is our position that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula should be achieved alongside the building of a peace regime, on the basis of the principle of simultaneous actions, step by step, starting with what we can do and prioritizing the building of trust. Out of the desire and resolute determination to successfully implement the Joint Statement, the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is primarily focusing its efforts on building trust. Even before the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States summit, our Government took significant goodwill measures, such as stopping nuclear and intercontinental ballistic-missile tests, dismantling the nuclear  test site in a transparent manner and committing not to transfer nuclear weapons or nuclear technology under any circumstances. We continue to make efforts to build trust.\nHowever, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States. On the contrary, instead of addressing our concern about the lack of a peace regime on the Korean peninsula, the United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased the level of pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose through coercion \u2014 even objecting to an end-of-war declaration. The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream of people who are ignorant about us. The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust. The reason behind the recent deadlock is that the United States relies on coercive methods that are lethal to trust-building.\nThe recent dramatic improvement in North-South relations and the atmosphere of cooperation clearly show how decisive the role  of  trust-building can be. In less than five months, the leaders of the North and the South met three times. Through their meetings and talks they have been building the trust in one another that is necessary to resolve the various issues in North-\n \nSouth relations in a constructive manner, and this has been translated into tangible results.\nAs demonstrated by the Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018, which was jointly announced by the leaders of the North and the South on 19 September, dialogue  between  the  two  countries  in  many   areas \u2014 including politics, the military, humanitarian work, sports, culture and economic cooperation \u2014 is very active, and there is an unprecedented atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation. Many noteworthy outcomes can be seen, and the process enjoys the support of and is welcomed by the entire Korean nation and the international community. If South Korea had been the party involved in the issue of denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at such a deadlock.\nThat is why we attach great importance to building confidence between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States for the implementation of the Joint Statement. Without trust in the United States, we can have no confidence with regard to our national security, and, under those circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm first. The commitment of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to denuclearization is firm. However, it will be possible only if the United States sufficiently earns our trust.\nThere are pessimistic views on the implementation of the Joint Statement inside the United States, but that is not due to any flaw in the Statement itself. Rather, it is because of the domestic politics of the United States. The political opposition there, with the sole purpose of attacking its political opponent, makes it  its daily business to slander the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, claiming that we cannot be trusted. That opposition is forcing the Administration to make unreasonable unilateral demands on us, thus impeding the smooth progress of dialogue and negotiations. Fuelling mistrust of a dialogue partner while relying only on coercive methods is not at all helpful in building trust; on the contrary, it only increases mistrust.\nOn the topic of reasons to distrust each other, it is we who have far more reasons to distrust the United States. First, the United States acquired nuclear weapons before we did and is the only country that  has actually used them in war. From the very first day of our Republic, 70 years ago, the United States has maintained a hostile policy against our country and\nhas imposed a total economic blockade on us, ensuring that United States companies cannot trade even a single screwnail with our country. Even though we have not thrown so much as a pebble onto United States soil, during the Korean War the United States threatened  to drop dozens of atomic bombs on our country. Even after that, the United States kept positioning strategic nuclear arsenals at our doorstep.\nIf both countries continue to harbour mistrust towards one other and to remain obsessed with the past, the recent Joint Statement cannot escape the same fate as all previous agreements between the two countries, namely, failure.\nOne part of the spirit of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States summit in Singapore was to free ourselves from old, conventional ways and to try an entirely new way of resolving the issues. At this critical juncture, the United States should use foresight and decide that the faithful fulfilment of the commitment that it made in Singapore will, in the end, be in its own national interest and should form the basis of a new method for improving relations between our two countries. Only then will the Joint Statement have positive prospects. If the Joint Statement falls victim to American internal politics, the main victim of the subsequent unpredictable consequences will be the United States.\nImproving bilateral relations and resolving issues on the Korean peninsula is key to achieving the theme of this session: \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. Our new policy of concentrating all efforts  on  building our economy is the right  political  choice,  not  only for improving the lives of our people but also for realizing the common aspirations of people around the world \u2014 peace and development.\nThe international community should support and encourage our efforts to focus on building the economy in response to the bold decisions and goodwill measures that we have taken for the easing of tension and the maintenance of lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. The implementation of the Joint Statement is a shared responsibility of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States. The United Nations also plays a key role.\nThe Security Council, which was once so  eager to express its concern about the tense situation on the\n \nKorean peninsula, has recently been silent about the valuable momentum for peace that we have achieved this year. That is quite strange. The Council rained down numerous sanctions resolutions on us, taking issue with our nuclear tests and missile test launches. But now, a full year after such tests were stopped, not a word in those resolutions has changed, to say nothing of completely removing or easing sanctions. Worse still, the Council is taking a very worrying stand by rejecting the proposal of some of its member States to issue a presidential statement that welcomes the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States summit and the Joint Statement.\nThe United Nations Command in South Korea even showed alarming signs of hindering the implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration on Peace, Prosperity and Reunification of the Korean Peninsula, reached between the North and the South. As for the United Nations Command, it is merely a command of the allied forces beyond the control of the United Nations and only obeys the orders of the United States, yet still misuses the sacred name of the Organization.\nBased on the mission of the Organization as defined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Organization, and especially the Security Council, has the responsibility and duty to support and welcome developments that help to ensure international peace and security. The United Nations should really apply the theme of this session to its actual activities and thus rid itself, as soon as possible, of the stigma of the feeling that the Security Council equals the United States.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, on her election to that honourable function. I wish to assure her of Poland\u2019s full support for the measures she will take. At the same time, I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his active leadership of the Assembly at its seventy-second session.\nThis year, Poles celebrate the centenary of regaining their independence. In 1918, after 123 years of bondage, Poland returned to the map of Europe and the world. The restoration of an independent, free and sovereign State became a reality mainly due to three factors: the desire of the Polish nation to have its own State, the heroic sacrifice of soldiers in battle and the determination of courageous leaders who convinced politicians across the world that, without a restored Poland, Europe would not be just and safe. Both then and today, the will of the nations and of the political leaders remains crucial. Both then and today, Europe cannot be just and safe without a sovereign Poland.\nEach September, the Heads of State and Government meet here at United Nations Headquarters in New York to engage in an in-depth reflection on the most crucial issues affecting our globe. It is therefore we who have a particular responsibility. It is we who are rightly expected to be courageous, active, able to rise above divisions and determined in our search for solutions to the most pressing issues of the contemporary world.\nOur world is full of threats. We are witnessing a very dynamic development of the international situation. There are reasons to be hopeful, such as a potential change in the situation on the Korean peninsula and the ongoing de-escalation of tensions there, but there are also problems that persist and remain unresolved. In order to resolve them, we undoubtedly need the cooperation of as many countries as possible today. Two conditions must be met if we are to be effective.\nFirst, we must all comply with international law, which was the main theme of  the  Polish  presidency of the Security Council in May. I had the privilege of convening a high-level open debate at that time (see S/PV.8262), which concluded that only cooperation among countries within the rules-based global order can provide an opportunity to resolve frozen conflicts and prevent the emergence of new ones, that the rules-based global order requires strong institutions\n \nto enforce international law, and that no violation of the law can be justified or distorted through twisted language definitions.\nToday the map of the world is full of flashpoints. As part of the rules-based global order that we are promoting, I would like to draw attention to one fundamental principle that will be our priority throughout the second year of Poland\u2019s membership of the Security Council. I am referring to the sovereign equality of States, as provided for  in  Article  2  of  the Charter of the United Nations. If we want to be advocates of multilateralism \u2014 and the United Nations is, after all, its source \u2014 we must bear that principle in mind. In other words, not everyone who claims to be a proponent of multilateralism thinks of it in terms of the equality of States. One can say that there is a negative multilateralism, which boils down to the concert of Powers, a division into spheres of influence and the conviction that the fate of others can be decided without their participation. Europe and Poland were often victims of that brand of multilateralism, starting in the eighteenth century, continuing throughout the nineteenth century, and lasting to the times of  the Cold War.\nMultilateralism and the rules-based global order are not just for the chosen ones. The same principles must apply to all in equal measure. Everyone has equal rights and proportional obligations. That  is  how I define the positive multilateralism that Poland stands for \u2014 the multilateralism of equal States and free nations, not the multilateralism of usurpation and hierarchy. We are committed to relations in which every State enjoys equal rights. That, however, does not imply a naive perception of a world devoid of differences among States. What it means is that States that have an advantage in terms of potential and power should not deprive others of their equal right to independence and sovereignty. Only when that equality is ensured can we fully use the potential of States for the common good and according to the rule of fair play. That applies both to political and economic relations, since only if the principle of the equality of States is respected can we talk about shared interests and enter into real alliances.\nHowever, the concept of positive multilateralism to which Poland  subscribes  goes  one  step  further.  It claims that, wherever possible, weaker countries should be given additional opportunities to have an impact in order to make the equal rights of States more realistic. Such opportunities can encompass additional\nvoting power or additional territorial representation in decision-making bodies. As President of the Republic of Poland, I am particularly attached to two areas of application of that principle: first, the awaited reform of the Security Council, which we support and want to participate in, and which should include among its leading themes expanding the field of equal rights and competences of all Council members; and secondly, a reform of the European Union, which emerged from the concept of positive multilateralism that today is being repeatedly violated, by returning it to its origins. Next year, Poland will organize a series of initiatives centred around the idea of sovereign equality. The aim of that effort is to win over as many supporters of our vision as possible. I invite one and all to participate in those debates.\nSecondly, it is important that multilateralism serve a certain system of values instead of being just one element of a political technology and a game of interests. Such a system of values is reflected in the Charter of the United Nations. Negative multilateralism, which contravenes those values, may only exacerbate global problems and aggravate the situation. On the other hand, the voluntary cooperation of States, equal in rights, can bring lasting peace to Europe and the world. Every time an attempt to create a  concert of  Powers  is born, global stability is undermined. Whoever promotes negative multilateralism contributes to the disintegration  of  the  global  order.  Multilateralism  is meant to be a commitment to respecting values, especially fundamental values such as respect for human dignity and life. It is about values that go beyond the political order and are not politically defined, for they are the foundation of the global order.\nInternational relations serve not only States but  all humankind. Therefore, a State\u2019s sovereignty should be fundamentally linked to its responsibility for ensuring respect for common norms for the good of all. Violations of those norms must have consequences. Whenever leaders violate fundamental human rights, engage in torture, persecute their political opponents or use weapons of mass destruction, the international community, including the Security Council, should respond swiftly, decisively and boldly.\nAs a nation with unique experience of a peaceful democratic transformation and a struggle for fundamental freedoms, Poland attaches particular importance to the protection and promotion  of  human rights, as exemplified by my country\u2019s bid\n \nfor membership of the Human Rights Council for the 2020-2022 term. Our membership of that body, which is unique in the global human rights protection system, would serve as a natural complement to our current membership of the Security Council, in accordance with the fundamental United Nations triad of peace and security, human rights and development.\nThe Charter of the United Nations endows the Organization, especially the Security Council, with a special responsibility for addressing matters pertaining to international peace and security. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, we deem that task to be of crucial importance. Poland actively supports all actions and initiatives aimed at preventing the use and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, as well as bringing those who use such weapons to justice.\nPoland intends to return  to  active  participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions. We have submitted a formal application to the Secretariat in that regard and look forward to its positive evaluation. We are convinced that our many years of experience in that field will contribute to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.\nPoland is involved in the process of stabilizing  the Korean peninsula and building lasting security there \u2014 not only now, in its capacity as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, but also as a member for dozens of years of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea. I am convinced that our long- term experience within the Commission could serve to establish permanent foundations for peace and stability on the peninsula.\nGiven the extensive experience it accumulated during the period of political transformation, Poland stands ready to become actively engaged in the international peace rebuilding and consolidation programmes in the Middle East, wherever it is necessary, post-conflict, to restore stability and provide development opportunities.\nAt the same time, Poland regards it as its duty to draw the attention of the international community to the sources of threats to world peace resulting from frozen conflicts, occupation and the shifting of borders by force, which is happening in Eastern Europe. The international community must not allow a return to business as usual, and the actions of the aggressors should be met with an appropriate response.\nIn December, Poland will have the honour to host the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 24) in the city of Katowice. The primary goal of that meeting is to finalize work on the provisions implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. A complete and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement is inextricably linked with the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, global climate action should incorporate the economic, social and environmental dimensions, and be conducive to stopping global warming and eradicating the most serious problems of the modern world.\nThe implementation package to be adopted in Katowice provides an  essential  basis  for  action  to be taken by State entities and non-governmental organizations, including international financial institutions, the private sector, local authorities and civil society organizations. Only provisions applicable in the long-term and accepted by  all  actors are able  to guarantee transparency, legal security and the sustainability of rules, which are indispensable to the implementation of the adopted obligations and for strengthening global ambitions.\nCOP 24 will be launched at a summit of leaders, to be held on 3 and 4 December, and offers an excellent opportunity to express our common and responsible political will. It will also send a clear message to the world that our efforts are aimed at securing a safe future for all. Once again, I wish to invite all Member States to attend the Katowice summit and ensure a high turnout for the event.\nThe centenary of Poland\u2019s recovery of its independence leads us to reflect on the fate of Europe and the world and on my country\u2019s difficult road to freedom and independence. It also provides a reason to look to the future and an inspiration to sensibly shape our common international reality based on historical experiences, values and aspirations. I encourage all Member States to collaborate even more closely on initiatives aimed at achieving the objectives that guide the Organization. Only decisions taken jointly by political leaders can effectively address the challenges faced by a globalized world.\nPoland subscribes to the view that our common future requires a strong and effective international community that will better accommodate the needs of humankind. That, however, will depend mainly on us,\n \nsince the United Nations is not an abstract entity but our common achievement. It is up to us how effective we will be in using it for the sake of building peace and ensuring justice and sustainable development \u2014 in other words, building a better world, worthy of the twenty-first century, for us and, first and foremost, for future generations, our children and our grandchildren.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that I stand before the members of the General Assembly this evening at the seventy-third session representing Sri Lanka for the fourth time.\nSri Lanka, as a State Member of the United Nations, has acted in accordance with treaties and conventions of the United Nations  at  all  times. For the past three and a half years, I have been the Head  of State of Sri Lanka, and today we are quite pleased with the progress we have made during my presidency. I was elected President of Sri Lanka in January 2015. At that time, the country\u2019s executive presidency held excessive powers. In fact, those powers exceeded those of a monarch, reaching almost the level of an emperor\u2019s. However, I handed over to the Sri Lanka Parliament those excessive powers. It is with pleasure that I inform the Assembly of the manner in which I let go of the excessive powers of the executive presidency.\nDuring the past three and a half years, we have taken action to consolidate democracy, human rights and the fundamental rights of the people. Furthermore, the freedom of media and the independence of the judiciary have been strengthened. That is why I can state with dignity that the Sri Lanka we see today is entirely different from the Sri Lanka of three and a half years ago.\nI also urgently want to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the fact that as States Members of the United Nations, we have certain responsibilities and duties to the world. For instance, the United Nations must focus greater attention on trends in international politics today. When we are talking about such worldwide  trends, the issue of refugees is a major and very complex one,\nas we all know. The United Nations, its Members and many other organizations today render a great service in supporting refugees. However,  those efforts need  to be more expansive and further strengthened to the benefit of refugees.\nSri Lanka follows a non-aligned foreign policy and is one of the most senior members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. A very successful summit of the Non-Aligned Movement was held in Sri Lanka in 1976. Sri Lanka considers every nation of the world a friend. We have no enemies in the world today, and we are very happy about that.\nWith regard to trends in international politics, I believe that the issue of the Palestinian people requires greater attention from the United Nations and all world Powers. Sri Lanka has always supported the freedom struggle of the Palestinian people. Many inhumane acts have been committed in that region, and I therefore believe that the United Nations and every nation of the world must stand strong to prevent them.\nAmong the many other problems plaguing the world, poverty is a major issue affecting the world\u2019s populations today. I believe that the United Nations must be more involved in fighting poverty. Hundreds of millions of people across the world spend  their days in hunger as a result of income disparities and climate change, giving rise to many issues in terms of alleviating poverty and battling the consequences of climate change. In the face of the many challenges that cause poverty, I believe that major efforts are needed in countries heavily affected by climate change in order to help people become prosperous.\nAs I said, there are many issues plaguing the world. The arms racket, the drug problem and the issue of illegal pharmaceuticals are also major concerns affecting society today. I am happy to note that action was taken yesterday, with President Donald Trump of the United States, and the United Nations, to bring together the nations of the world through the Global Call to Action on the World Drug Problem. That is something we greatly appreciate. Ending the drug menace requires extensive efforts from each and every country, working together with the United Nations.\nFurthermore, at the international level, we know that the United Nations plays a very important role, particularly through the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which is of huge significance to everything living on Earth. As a Member of the United Nations,\n \nSri Lanka ratified the Agreement. I would like to draw members\u2019 attention to the fact that we are committed to taking the necessary action on agreed matters under the Paris Agreement.\nWhen it comes to Sri Lanka, as I mentioned earlier, we have taken action to consolidate democracy and strengthen fundamental rights, including human rights and media rights. I would like to point out that Sri Lanka suffered from a long-drawn-out conflict for 30 years. It has now been 10 years since the conflict ended, during which time a massive transformation has taken place in Sri Lanka, especially during the past three and a half years. The Government in Sri Lanka has taken action on the post-war situation. We have strengthened national reconciliation and taken steps to ensure that the war cannot recur, with an extensive programme currently being implemented to achieve that. With regard to human rights, the Government is continuing to fulfil its duty to protect the people\u2019s rights and to seek the support of the United Nations in strengthening the programme, which is the course of action that we want to follow.\nSri Lankan forces were able to defeat one of the most brutal terrorist organizations in the world. That is why Sri Lanka today has emerged strongly as a country that is permanently at peace. Our security forces defeated a very serious terrorist organization. Here I would like to very respectfully salute the efforts made by the Tri-Forces  of  Sri Lanka to bring peace  to our country and strengthen its unity. As I said, 10 years have now passed since the end of the conflict. I therefore encourage the international community not to think of Sri Lanka as it did 10 years ago but to view it from a fresh perspective. We suffered a difficult war, and today permanent peace prevails in our country. My Government has been undertaking many actions to consolidate reconciliation. Human rights are being protected and economic prosperity is being achieved for a better future for Sri Lankans, and our future as a peaceful nation therefore deserves to be looked at from a fresh perspective.\nI urge the international community to allow Sri Lankans to resolve their problems on their own. A nation\u2019s independence is of the utmost  importance. But our humanitarian  efforts and our work to strengthen democracy require the international community\u2019s cooperation. If Sri Lanka is to continue in its commitment to forging ahead in consolidating democracy and protecting human rights, it needs the\ninternational community\u2019s attention. As an independent country, we reject any efforts by foreign Powers to exert influence on us. We appeal to the international community to give us room to resolve our problems and to respect the Sri Lankan people\u2019s right to find solutions to their problems. And while that is something that we are very willing to do, I would also like to ask for the international community\u2019s cooperation in making that a reality.\nWe are working to eliminate fear and suspicion among the  various ethnic groups in our country, and  I believe that with the cooperation of the international community that can be achieved, not only in Sri Lanka but in many other countries of the world. The poor must be given priority. The new generation deserves  to be heard. They need to be provided with solutions to their problems.\nIn conclusion, I would like to cite a verse from Lord Buddha found in the Salla Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya in the Tripitaka, where it is said that a man pierced by an arrow feels two kinds of pain: first, the physical pain caused by the arrow and, secondly, the mental pain resulting from his anxiety about what has happened. Similarly, the people of Sri Lanka have suffered both the physical pain of the war and the feelings that it arouses. I therefore urge the international community to extend its support and cooperation to Sri Lanka.\nI thank the Assembly, and may the Noble Triple Gem bless us all.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to express my warm and fraternal congratulations to Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her outstanding election to  preside  over the General Assembly at its  seventy-third  session. Her vast experience in international political affairs will undoubtedly contribute greatly to the successful conduct of the work of the Assembly. In our capacity as Vice-President elected by the Assembly, we assure her of our full support in carrying out her noble task.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his dedicated commitment in the way he managed the previous session. I am also deeply grateful to Secretary-General\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres for his enlightened leadership and for his laudable initiatives since he assumed his post. His efforts  are  aimed  at  giving  renewed impetus  to our Organization, particularly in the essential domains pertaining to international peace, security and development.\nIt is highly regrettable that the entire world continues to experience an unprecedented and multifaceted crisis; the Secretary-General was right in warning about the risks that that entails. He rightly warned that conflicts had worsened and that new dangers are emerging (see A/73/PV.6). Global concerns related to nuclear weapons have not reached the current level since the Second World War. Environmental imbalances are occurring faster than our responses can deal with them, and the gap resulting from the current differences is growing wider, while gross human rights violations are taking place and nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise.\nIn the context of the advanced and inevitable growth in globalization that we face, the seriousness of those colossal challenges, both old and new, are aggravated by the perverse effects of the continuing  economic and financial crisis. Against that backdrop,  which  has become even more alarming owing to the recent appearance of unilateral and protectionist trends, we must have the courage to recognize the inadequacy and futility of the policies that have been implemented to date and the structural deficiencies of the increasingly ineffective global governance architecture.\nWhen he acceded to the presidency of the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika warned that membership in the United Nations was not enough to protect nations against hunger and insecurity (see A/PV.2233). Today, we can no longer accept the perpetuation of an international order that does not encourage the international values of peace, justice and development, as well as science and technology, while contributing to improving living conditions. That order has concentrated economic and financial resources in the hands of a small minority, widening the existing gap that separates the richest from the poorest countries and peoples. The unfortunate conclusion is that we are facing a real moral crisis.\nI would like to commend the rightness and appropriateness of the theme chosen for our session. Indeed, now more than ever, the United Nations must find ways and means that enable it to fully play the role that its founding fathers envisioned for it following\n \nthe devastation of a global confrontation. Such a vital objective for the entire international community cannot be achieved without a renewed collective commitment to effective and real multilateralism, in harmony with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations \u2014 a commitment to which the former Secretary-General, the late Kofi Annan, a worthy son of Africa and a committed citizen of the world, dedicated his life and with which he associated his name. While the United Nations remains the distinctive forum for dialogue and cooperation among the nations of the world, it must also bring about the desired change.\nIn our view, the genuine change that we seek and which is of the utmost priority requires us to mobilize all our capabilities and efforts with a view to reforming the United Nations itself. It is imperative that the reform should involve both the structures and the operating methods of the Organization, particularly the Security Council, by paying particular attention in the first place to redressing the historical injustice done to the African continent in terms of its underrepresentation in both membership categories of that body. The reform must also include the revitalization of the role of the General Assembly and the strengthening of its authority \u2014 a necessity around which there is, fortunately, a growing consensus.\nConscious of our responsibilities and contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security and with full respect for the cardinal principles of our foreign policy, Algeria follows with particular interest the crises and conflicts facing the countries in our region. While continuing to fully play our role to the best of our ability, my country reiterates its conviction, on the basis of our own experience, that conflicts cannot be totally resolved without promoting solutions that are owned by the parties concerned and reached through inclusive dialogue and that place national interests above all other considerations, thereby preserving the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States. Whether related to the situations in Mali, Libya, Syria or Yemen, only such an approach can enable those sisterly countries to restore peace and stability so that they may begin their rebuilding process.\nWith regard to the Western Sahara issue, which comes before the United Nations as an issue of decolonization, Algeria believes that its settlement can be achieved only by allowing the people of the Western Sahara to exercise their inalienable and non-assignable right to self-determination.\nMy country reiterates its firm support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara and expresses the hope that their actions, together with the input of the African Union, will contribute to the resumption of negotiations without preconditions and in good faith between the two parties to the conflict, namely, the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front, with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable political solution that ensures the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.\nIn the same vein, Algeria is  convinced that only  a solution based on international legitimacy and the recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to establish  an independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, can put a definitive end to the conflict that has existed in the Middle East for seven decades.\nTerrorism, of which Algeria was the first target at the end of the last century, has now become one of the most destructive scourges on the planet. At the cost of heavy sacrifices, my country was able to confront it alone by adopting an approach and by harnessing methods that have proved to be effective. That experience, which we are willing to share, was based on the conviction that addressing terrorism must imperatively tackle its root causes and must be accompanied by a policy that is resolute against violent extremism.\nThe international community is particularly called upon to ensure that the fight against terrorism is accompanied by measures to fight extremism and the promotion of policies that advocate coexistence. In that context, I am pleased to recall that the United Nations resolution declaring 16 May as the International Day of Living Together in Peace (resolution 72/130), which was initiated by Algeria, is part of the efforts to promote the principle of an inclusive dialogue leading the quest for solutions to the challenges to stability at both the national and the international levels.\nWe are proud that the values and principles of living together in peace were the basis of the policy of civil harmony and national reconciliation, which was implemented with determination by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of the Republic of Algeria in order to end the national tragedy and reconcile Algerians with each other.\nThose unifying ideals are considered above all to be the common factor among the strategies, policies\n \nand programmes that were implemented in the various economic, social, educational, cultural and religious fields. Those  same  principles  consistently   guide my country\u2019s foreign policy in our relations with neighbouring countries and other countries of the world.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development are remarkable achievements that require the substantial mobilization of both the means and the capabilities for their implementation. We express the hope that the outcome of the High-level Meeting on Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was convened by the Secretary-General on 24 September, will provide a solid foundation for concerted action between the United Nations system and Member States for development in line with the aspirations of developing countries, as advocated by the Group of 77.\nAlgeria, which participated actively in the development of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, is about to finalize its national progress report for 2016-2018 on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, for voluntary submission to the Economic and Social Council in July 2019. That is part of the new development agenda adopted by Algeria in 2016.  It  is a  policy that aims  to place Algeria among emerging countries by 2035, enabling it to diversify and transform its economy through the revival and consolidation of its economic growth. That will benefit all its citizens, as well as countries of the region as a whole.\nBefore concluding, I cannot but commend the efforts made by our national authorities regarding the recent constitutional review, which seeks to benefit all segments of Algerian society, in particular the rights of women and supporting them to be independent, as well as support for young people in order to ensure their effective integration into the country\u2019s economic and social development process. Those efforts have earned the recognition of the international community for their focus on promoting both human rights and stability and security. We are honoured by such acknowledgements and feel reassured in our global approach.\nThe rejection of policies based on force, with the dangers that they entail, requires that we constantly seek, through dialogue and consensus, to strengthen multilateral action. In our view, that is the best way\nto respond to the global security and development challenges facing the nations and countries of the world. Through its focus on demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness for which everyone yearns, the United Nations plays a central role in the endeavour to restore the respect owed to it.\nThe success of the United Nations is  a  success  for all. We must work  to make it  a  forum not  only for discussing our differences but also for resolving them. Our Organization should be the place where our partnerships are forged.\nWe particularly commend the General Assembly\u2019s unanimous acceptance of the concept of living together in peace. Algeria believes that failure to live in peace is not inevitable. Conflicts, human tragedies, terrorism and environmental disasters do not affect only certain people and not others. Destiny is a common thing, as President Bouteflika said.\nWe  are  called  on  to  make  the  United  Nations a unique means to serve peaceful and sustainable societies. Given our conviction and approach, Algeria will in all cases be a loyal and committed partner for achieving peace and development.\n"

        "file_text": "Every September, global attention is focused on the United Nations and on this stately Assembly Hall. People watch closely what is happening here, hoping that the United Nations will deliver peace, development, harmony  and prosperity to the world. People look to the United Nations to help them realize their dreams for a better life, to a United Nations that is committed to making itself relevant to all people, thereby making our world a better place for everyone to live in.\nThe contemporary international order, which began with the founding of the United Nations, is based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and is enhanced by the vision and practice of multilateralism. It has brought about general peace and rapid development over the past 70 years or more. A\n \npeople-centred philosophy has gained wide acceptance, and a broad consensus has formed on the need for interdependence and win-win cooperation.\nYet it is also true that the international  order today faces problems and needs steady reform and improvement. The world is changing. As we celebrate humankind\u2019s proud achievements and progress, we must never lose sight of the challenges and difficulties we face in an ever-changing world. We must remain vigilant. What we see today is that international rules and multilateral mechanisms are under attack, and the international landscape is filled with uncertainties and destabilizing factors. Should we stay committed to multilateralism or let unilateralism have its way? Should we seek to uphold the architecture of the world order or allow it to be eroded and collapse? Those are critical questions bearing on the future of all countries and the destiny of humankind, questions that all countries must carefully reflect on and seek answers to.\nChina\u2019s answer is clear cut.  All  along,  China  has upheld the international order and pursued multilateralism. Though once kept out of the United Nations for 22 years, China has never wavered in its commitment to multilateralism and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. China stayed true to  its  commitment  throughout  the negotiation process on its return to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and then its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) \u2014 negotiations that lasted 15 long years and were concluded at a certain price. China fulfilled its promise and integrated itself into the world economic system. After the international financial crisis broke out, China chose not to stand idly by; instead it worked together with other countries to get through those challenging times. For many years, China has contributed more than 30 per cent of global economic growth. It has played its part in helping with the global recovery. In the face of new developments and severe challenges, China will keep to its commitment and remain a champion of multilateralism.\nStanding at this rostrum in 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping, in his statement reflecting the key understanding of humankind\u2019s common interest and the future of  our planet, called for  the building  of a community with a shared future for humankind (seeA/70/PV.13). That initiative is in keeping with the trend of history, and it echoes the call of the times. It adds to our conviction and strength as we pursue our common endeavour to protect this global village. It\npoints us in the direction where we should work together to open up an even better future for humankind.\nTo uphold multilateralism in this new era, we believe that the following principles must be adhered to. First, we must pursue win-win cooperation. Our world is undergoing profound changes, never before seen in this century. Also never seen before are the problems and challenges we are facing. No country can meet them alone or stay immune to their impact. We must replace confrontation with cooperation and coercion with consultation. We must remain united as a big family. Instead of forming closed circles, we must promote common development through consultation instead of taking a \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d approach. That is a sure way to usher in a bright future.\nSecondly, we must act in accordance with rules and order. State-to-State relations must be based on credibility, not the wilful revocation of commitments. International cooperation should be guided by rules, not impulse. Practising multilateralism is, first and foremost, about upholding the Charter of the United Nations, observing international law and basic norms governing international relations, and honouring international agreements reached through negotiations.\nThirdly, we must uphold the principles of fairness and justice. In international affairs, fairness and justice mean equality among all countries, big or small. They signify the responsibility  of  big  countries  to  help the small, and rich ones to assist the poor. Fairness  and justice also mean respect for other countries\u2019 sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as their choice of  development paths and right to a better life and increased development opportunities.\nFourthly, we must act to deliver real results. Multilateralism is not based on empty rhetoric. It must be pursued to solve problems. Efforts must be targeted, results-oriented and measured by visible progress. Whether a multilateral mechanism works depends on the will and engagement of countries. It is imperative that we work together to uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core, as well as the multilateral trading system centred on the World Trade Organization. Multilateralism requires a strong United Nations. China supports Secretary-General Guterres in advancing reform of the United Nations system in the three critical areas of peace and security, economic development and internal management. That reform should be led by Member States, and it should prioritize\n \nthe concerns of developing countries, make the United Nations more effective and enhance oversight and accountability. Stable and predictable funding is critical to the proper functioning of the United Nations. China will continue to fulfil its financial obligations and calls on other Member States to pay their membership contributions and peacekeeping assessments on time and in full.\nThe momentum of humankind\u2019s drive forward towards development and progress is unstoppable. Peace, reconciliation and harmony represent the predominant trend, while war, conflict and terror are opposed by all. Equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation are key words of our times, whereas power politics and the law of the jungle find no support. As a major responsible country, China is committed to the path of peaceful development, and it will work together with other countries and contribute its share to global peace and security.\nOver the past year, the situation on the Korean peninsula has seen a major turnaround thanks to the efforts of all the parties concerned. China,  for  its part, has contributed to that progress. China supports the comprehensive improvement of relations between the north and the south of the peninsula, as well as efforts to facilitate dialogue between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States. China encourages the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to continue moving towards denuclearization. We believe that it is also incumbent on the United States to respond in a timely and positive manner so  as to truly meet  the  Democratic  People\u2019s  Republic of Korea halfway. China will continue to honour its international responsibilities and obligations and will strictly implement the Security Council resolutions related to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. China calls on the Security Council to take timely action in the light of developments and changes in the situation so as to create more favourable  conditions for a peaceful settlement of the issue on the peninsula through political and diplomatic means. To effectively settle the issue we need complete denuclearization and the establishment of a peace mechanism. Only when those components move in tandem can the issue be truly resolved and peace achieved.\nRegarding the Iranian nuclear issue, now is a crucial time for the continued implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The JCPOA is a consensus-based multilateral agreement endorsed\nby the Security Council. It serves the common interests of all the parties concerned and the international community at large. If it is not implemented, the international nuclear non-proliferation regime  will be undermined, the authority and role of the Security Council challenged, and peace and stability jeopardized both in that region and throughout the world,. That is  a scenario from which no one stands to gain. China urges the parties concerned to continue to observe and implement the JCPOA. On that basis, the possibility could be explored for a platform for dialogue that is inclusive and transparent so as to enable each party\u2019s concerns to be adequately addressed through  talks and consultations.\nThe question of Palestine must not be marginalized. For more than seven decades, peace and justice have remained elusive in that part of the world. What the international community needs most is not a proposal or an initiative but resolve and action. In order to implement a two-State solution, a new round of peace-promoting efforts must be made with a view to exploring a new mediation mechanism. To that end, China will play its part, and Chinese humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people will continue.\nThe issue involving Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state cannot be resolved overnight, and steady progress must be made through a three-phase process involving a cessation of violence, the return of the displaced persons and economic development. Myanmar and Bangladesh are inseparable neighbours and could well be inseparable partners. Yesterday, at my meeting with colleagues from Myanmar and Bangladesh and in the presence of Secretary-General Guterres, an agreement was reached between Myanmar and Bangladesh on accelerating the return of the first wave of displaced persons. We believe that Myanmar and  Bangladesh are capable of resolving the issue properly through friendly negotiations.\nChina supports the leading role of the United Nations in coordinating responses to non-traditional security challenges. On the new frontiers of global governance, such as cyberspace and outer space, State sovereignty must be upheld, rules observed and responsibilities honoured. Terrorism, a threat to all societies, can never be justified. Security Council resolutions must be vigorously implemented to counter cyberterrorism, terrorist financing and the spread of radical narratives so as to eliminate the breeding grounds of terrorism.\n \nDevelopment is essential for our world today. We need to address both insufficient development and, more importantly, imbalance in development. There  is no one-size-fits-all model. Every country is entitled to explore a particular development path aimed at delivering happiness and security to its people and bringing about a future of confidence and hope for its children. Countries face various questions with regard to development. Such questions could be turned into drivers for reform, and solutions to problems could bring about development. Economic globalization should not be a process whereby some profit and others lose; even less should it result in widening the gap between North and South. It is important that we  adapt to the trend  of economic globalization and ensure that the process is open, inclusive, balanced and mutually beneficial so that it can deliver benefits to  all.  International trade is complementary and mutually beneficial in nature.  It should not be a zero-sum game in which one side gains at the expense of the others, and no one should be allowed to place their own interest above the interest of others. Protectionism will only be self-defeating, and unilateral moves will hurt everyone.\nWith regard to friction in trade, China stands for  a proper settlement of disagreements based on rules and consensus through dialogue and consultation on an equal footing. China will not be blackmailed or yield to pressure. We have not only taken steps to defend our own legitimate rights and interests but also to uphold the free trade system, international rules and the international order for the benefit of global recovery and the common interests of all countries.\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should be at the top of the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. We need to incorporate its implementation into Member States\u2019 development strategies and pursue innovation-driven, coordinated, green and open development that benefits all. We need to forge closer partnerships for development and pursue international development cooperation, with the United Nations at its centre and North-South cooperation as the main channel, supplemented by South-South cooperation. To meet the challenges of climate change, it is crucial to achieve sustainable development. China hopes to see the conclusion of the negotiations on the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, scheduled for the end of this year, with a view to boosting joint efforts for global ecological conservation.\nIn pursuing our common cause of humankind\u2019s development and progress, China has worked in partnership with other countries of the international community. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of China\u2019s reform and opening up. Over those 40 years, we have worked hard and forged ahead successfully along a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. That path has brought fundamental changes to China. In the past 40 years, more than 700 million individuals in the Chinese population have been lifted out of absolute poverty, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of the global totals for the same period. A basic medical insurance system has been set up to cover China\u2019s 1.35 billion people, and a social pension network accessible to more than 900 million people has been fully implemented. China has built approximately 25,000 kilometres of high-speed railway. That accounts for two thirds of the global total and helps elevate global infrastructure construction.  According  to polls conducted by authoritative international polling agencies, China is at the top of global rankings in terms of public satisfaction with its development and public confidence in its future. The path  of  development that China is pursuing has provided the world with opportunities for shared development. Over the past 40 years, China\u2019s foreign trade has averaged an annual growth rate of 14.5 per cent. That has sustained the impetus for global growth and provided the world with a huge Chinese market. We have every  confidence that we will maintain that momentum and continue to realize high-quality development. China will accelerate efforts to build an advanced economic system, which will create greater trade opportunities and an even better investment environment for other countries.\nChina will not reverse course or  shut  its  doors but will rather open its doors even wider to the world. China will not erect market barriers but will expand access to the Chinese market. Of all of the developing countries in the world, China has been the fastest in terms of opening up at a level unparalleled by others. When it comes to overall tariff reduction, China has accomplished more than it committed to when it joined the WTO. The breadth of China\u2019s openness in services is close to the average level of  developed countries.  In November, China will host the first International Import Expo in Shanghai, which will be yet another major step in opening China\u2019s market. Countries are welcome to participate actively in it.\n \nThe Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by President Xi Jinping, is a public good that China is providing for the world. It has grown into the largest platform for international cooperation. It aims to deliver benefits for all through consultations and cooperation. The Initiative is open, transparent and inclusive. It is  based on international rules and laws, and it aims to achieve green, environment-friendly and sustainable development. It is about pursuing common prosperity through greater complementarity among participating countries. By September, more than 130 countries and international organizations will have signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. Next year, China will host the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, and we welcome all parties to attend that event.\nChina is the largest developing country in the world. Strengthening cooperation and solidarity with other developing countries has been and will continue to be a firm strategic priority in China\u2019s diplomacy. That choice has been determined by what defines China as a country and by the system and values that China upholds. No matter how  much  China has increased  in strength, and regardless of how the international landscape might change, that strategic priority of China will not change.\nThe United Nations is the primary platform for advocating for and practising multilateralism. We hope that the current session of the General Assembly will be remembered for its part in upholding multilateralism, world peace and development.  We  hope  that  all  of us in the international community will support the United Nations in its efforts to play a central role in international affairs, and we call on people of all countries to work together to build a community with a shared future for humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "In the 73 years since our Organization was created, Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s is the fourth woman to be elected President of the General Assembly, and only the second in half a century. Her election deserves to be particularly welcomed and that is why, on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9, President of Burkina Faso, whom I have the honour to represent here, as well as on behalf of my delegation, I offer her my warmest and most sincere congratulations. Burkina Faso, a Vice-President of the General Assembly at this session, will spare no effort to ensure the success of our work.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, whose actions since he took office have not gone unnoticed, I reaffirm Burkina Faso\u2019s full support for his commitment and determination to bring about important and ambitious reforms to make the United Nations more effective.\nBefore continuing, I want to spare a thought for the brotherly and friendly people of Indonesia, who\n \nhave been severely tested today by an earthquake and a tsunami. On behalf of President Kabor\u00e9, I extend our sincere condolences and deepest sympathies to the Government and the people of Indonesia and to the families of the victims. We also wish the many injured a swift recovery.\nBurkina Faso has been tirelessly pursuing its efforts to strengthen democracy and consolidate the rule of law through many measures, including finalizing the preliminary draft of our new Constitution and, on 30 July, revising the law on the electoral code. Referendum consultations are scheduled for 2019. Our future Constitution, drafted in a consultative framework, aims to strengthen human rights and civil liberties, taking into account other new provisions, such as access to land for all, the right to clean drinking water, the right to employment and the abolition of the death penalty. Further provisions are planned to introduce balance into the distribution of power. In addition, the process of revising the electoral code will pave the way for Burkina Faso citizens overseas to vote, allowing them to participate in the presidential elections in 2020 for the first time in our country\u2019s history.\nMeanwhile, many other reforms have been launched to improve political and economic governance, modernize the Administration, consolidate public finances and strengthen the independence of the judiciary, as well as human rights. On the economic front, despite a difficult security and social context, Burkina Faso has attained a growth rate of 6.7 per  cent thanks to the consolidation of public finances, the initiation of reforms to improve tax revenues and the structuring of projects launched within the framework of the national economic and social development plan. The fruits of that growth have been redistributed by building infrastructure and adopting social measures in favour of our most underprivileged citizens, particularly women and girls. Our free health-care policy has significantly improved care for pregnant women and children under the age of five and will continue with the operationalization of a universal health-insurance system that will gradually enable health-care coverage to be extended to all Burkina Faso citizens.\nIn terms of public health and access to drinking water, substantial efforts have been made to benefit rural and urban areas. Likewise, our special job- creation programme for young people and women aims to promote their access to jobs and acquisition  of vocational skills, with a view to opening up\nopportunities for their sustainable integration  into  the labour market. In addition, an integrated women\u2019s empowerment programme aims to strengthen their productive capacities and their participation in Burkina Faso\u2019s economic and social development by 2020.\nBurkina  Faso  remains  very  concerned  about the insecurity and terrorist attacks that it has been subjected to for the past three years. Once limited to our northern regions, the terrorist threat has gradually spread to other areas, especially the south-west and the east, which border on C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana and the Niger, Benin and Togo respectively. In the space of three years, 229 civilians and military or paramilitary troops have been killed by armed terrorist groups.\nIn order to tackle that worrying situation, my Government is mobilizing all its human, financial, military, non-military and material resources to combat this terrible threat and ensure the people\u2019s security. Unfortunately, our unconscionable and faithless enemies will stop at nothing to sow their seeds of terror. Their new modus operandi is the use of improvised explosive devices. To provide some context, they have blown up two vehicles this week alone using such fatal devices, killing 14 members of our defence and security forces participating in security operations within our borders.\nBesides attacking our defence and security forces, symbols of the State, the terrorists have been targeting civilians, students and teachers. More than 520 schools have closed, depriving nearly 56,000 students of their right to an education owing to  the  terrorist  threat. By targeting schools, armed terrorist groups are attacking the education system generally, and thereby educated people \u2014 people who would try to thwart the dissemination of the terrorists\u2019 ideas and way of life. The terrorists know that an educated and enlightened person is more difficult to manipulate than one without education. Far from causing us to lose heart, those attacks have reinforced our  unity,  solidarity and determination to defend the values that underpin Burkina Faso \u2014 our republican form of Government, democracy, secularism and social cohesion.\nIn the fight against terrorism, one thing is unanimously acknowledged, which is that no one country can combat that threat alone. Even by coming together, as the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) countries have done in order to pool their efforts, the fact remains that our countries absolutely need the support of the international community to render the G-5 Sahel\n \nJoint Force operational. Beyond the countries directly affected by the terrible phenomenon of terrorism, the fight against terrorism is directly related to our broader need for international peace and security.\nIndeed, in its resolution 72/165 of 19 December 2017, proclaiming 21 August  the  International  Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism, the General Assembly reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to strengthening international cooperation to prevent and fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In that regard, Burkina Faso appeals to the Security  Council  to  place  the G-5 Sahel Joint Force under a mandate deriving from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, with a view to ensuring that it receives sustainable and multilateral financing.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to recall that the Security Council, by its resolutions 2320 (2016) and 2378 (2017), has already expressed its intention to take concrete steps to establish the principles under which African Union peace operations authorized by the Security Council should be funded through United Nations assessed contributions, with decisions on funding specific missions to be taken on a case-by-case basis. At the seventy-second session, President Laj\u010d\u00e1k reminded us that\n\u201cpeace and prevention should be at the centre of everything the United Nations does, because when we read the Charter of the United Nations, there are only five references to war. The word \u2018peace\u2019, however, appears 47 times\u201d (A/72/PV.3, p.5).\nTherefore, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282 (2016), both adopted on 27 April 2016, the high-level meeting on peacebuilding and sustaining peace (see A/72/PV.83 et seq.) held from 24 to 25 April placed particular emphasis on prevention. Indeed, prevention is at the heart of building and sustaining peace and must therefore be a primary objective for both States and the United Nations. It is  also the primary responsibility  of national Governments to determine the necessary priorities and strategies by  involving every stratum of society. In order to consolidate peace, we must address the root causes of conflict, such as poverty, exclusion, discrimination \u2014 and, indeed, the effects of climate change.\nIt is for that reason that the Government of Burkina Faso launched an emergency programme for the Sahel\nfor the period from 2017 to 2020 as a holistic response to the region\u2019s dual socioeconomic and security challenges, through the realization of socioeconomic infrastructure projects and the establishment of basic social services, as well as the promotion of production and processing activities as sources of income for the people in the northern areas of our country. Initiatives for building and sustaining peace can succeed only if they receive sufficient, predictable, sustainable and coherent funding by involving multilateral and bilateral partners, as well as the private sector. Burkina Faso welcomes and applauds the support that it enjoys from the United Nations system and from the European Union in the implementation of that emergency programme.\nThe purposes and principles of  the  Charter  of the United Nations are aimed at achieving a world of peace, justice, solidarity and social well-being for all, on a planet that is not threatened by climate change. The support that many countries like Burkina Faso receive from the United Nations system for their efforts to achieve development, and thereby the Sustainable Development Goals, is highly appreciated. That is why we welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution 72/279, on repositioning the United Nations development system, which provides for a revitalization of the role of the resident coordinator system.\nBurkina Faso welcomes the support given to the Sahel countries through the United Nations Support Plan for the Sahel. The Plan, which covers the period from 2018 to 2030, will improve coordination and strengthen collaboration among the partners in the region. In addition, it will help to implement the priorities identified for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063.\nIt is now more necessary than ever that we defend and encourage multilateralism. That is the belief of Burkina Faso, and it must be a vision shared by all if we are to create a more open and more inclusive world. It is in the name of international solidarity that Burkina Faso is now engaged in six peacekeeping operations with more than 2,000 personnel, making our country a major actor in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are also one of the few countries \u2014 one of only three, in fact \u2014 that maintain a  military contingent  in Guinea-Bissau responsible for the security of its republican institutions. Burkina Faso is the largest troop-contributing country to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in\n \nMali and the largest contributor of correctional officers to the United Nations. In that capacity, we will succeed Canada as Chair of the Group of Friends of Corrections in Peace Operations for a one-year term.\nBecause the credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations also depend on its ability to prevent and manage crises and to promote international peace and security, Burkina Faso welcomes the reforms of management and of the peace and security pillar, which should improve the ability of the United Nations to effectively carry out its mission of sustainable peace and social progress for citizens around the world. Burkina Faso commends the Secretary-General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative and the holding of a high-level meeting on that initiative at this session. The adoption of the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations highlights the achievements of peacekeeping operations and enables us to reaffirm our shared commitment to addressing the most pressing challenges.\nAs peace, security, democracy, respect for human rights and development are intrinsically linked, we must work to ensure that all countries in crisis find peace. That is why Burkina Faso congratulates the Government and the people of Mali on their successful holding of presidential elections, despite the context there of terrorist threats, and calls on the Malian political class to stand together in making every possible effort to overcome that enemy. The peace agreement between the political leaders of South Sudan also merits high praise. On the subject of Western Sahara, Burkina Faso welcomes the announcement of the resumption of negotiations before the end of the year.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be of real concern, and Burkina Faso remains convinced that a solution must be political, peaceful, just and equitable, based on the existence of two States living side by side within secure and recognized borders. In Asia, the commencement of dialogue between the two Koreas is a good sign and should be encouraged and supported by the international community. Burkina Faso strongly endorses their dialogue. With regard to the economic, financial and commercial embargo against Cuba, Burkina Faso calls for it to be completely lifted.\nThe proliferation of small arms and light weapons poses a threat to peace and security in various parts  of the world and is an obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why my\ncountry welcomes the inclusion of ammunition in the final document (A/CONF.192/2018/RC/3) of the Third United Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the  Programme of  Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects.\nWith regard to weapons of mass destruction, we condemn the resurgence of the use of chemical weapons in recent years and call for general and complete disarmament where all weapons of mass destruction concerned.\nHumanitarian issues are of paramount importance in view of the growing number of refugees and migrants around the world. Burkina Faso therefore welcomes the inclusive negotiation process that has resulted in the drafting of consensus-based texts for a global compact for safe, orderly  and  regular  migration,  scheduled  to be adopted at the  Intergovernmental  Conference on the Global Compact for Migration, to be held on African soil in Marrakech on 10 and 11 December. As a migration country, with at least 4 million citizens living abroad and nearly 25,000 refugees on its territory, Burkina Faso intends to play an active role in the adoption of the two global compacts on migration and on refugees. They should help not only to establish effective migration management around the world but also to better protect refugees and migrants.\nBurkina Faso  also  welcomes  the  organization  on the margins of the seventy-third session of the General Assembly of high-level events on topics such as tuberculosis and non-communicable diseases. There is no doubt that the recommendations resulting from those two events will contribute to improving the management of those diseases, which have a negative impact on people\u2019s lives.\nIntergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform have been going on for more than 20 years, with 13 rounds of negotiations, but no comprehensive and satisfactory solution has emerged, even though the vast majority of Member States agree in principle on having a Security Council that is more representative, better adapted to contemporary realities and better able to quickly respond to crises. With the support of the majority of Member States, we must now move towards text-based negotiations, which is the only way to advance towards a genuine and consensual solution. We sincerely hope that we can achieve reform of the Security Council, as it would redress the injustice done\n \nto Africa, which deserves a permanent place on the Security Council, and should have one.\nWhile all of the themes of the sessions of the General Assembly command our attention, this year\u2019s theme, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, challenges us even more. Its implementation also requires adequate representation for all Member States in the bodies of our Organization. In that connection, Burkina Faso calls for universal support for the candidacy of Mr. Brahima Sanou for the post of Deputy  Secretary-General  of the International Telecommunications Union, in the elections scheduled for the Union\u2019s plenipotentiary conference, to be held from 29 October to 16 November in the United Arab Emirates.\nDespite its 73 years of existence, our Organization must continue to work to strengthen itself and to assure people of its relevance and importance. Building an equitable world in a peaceful and healthy environment is a shared and long-term undertaking and a responsibility that we all share. Let us therefore trust our Organization, the only framework that enables us to remain united in strong action and that creates greater hopes for the  peoples  of  the  world. To that end, I  want to pay a  well-deserved tribute to a great man and a worthy son of Africa who stood at the helm of our shared Organization. I am referring, of course, to the late Mr. Kofi Annan.\n"

        "file_text": "I convey very special congratulations to Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to preside over the General Assembly. I congratulate her on her personality and career, on the priorities she has defined, on the progress she represents in gender equality at  the United Nations and on the informal interactive dialogue, which is a sign of the increased transparency of the General Assembly.\nPortugal welcomes and reaffirms its full support for the priorities the Secretary-General has set  and the actions he has pursued during his lucid, dynamic and exceptional mandate. Multilateralism, based on international law and the Charter of the United Nations, the reform of the Organization, conflict prevention, peacekeeping and the maintenance of peace, concern for migration and refugees, combating terrorism and international crime, the oceans and maritime security, climate change, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, gender equality and support for our\nyoung people are all aimed at the permanent upholding of human rights.\nThe key is always strengthened multilateralism. That is why we do not understand \u2014 and in fact deplore \u2014 the use of unilateralism as a way to disinvest in international organizations. It represents political short-sightedness that runs the risk of making us repeat the mistakes that were made almost a century ago. United Nations reform requires the commitment of all Member States. Maintaining the status quo is a way of gutting multilateralism and, in the absence of prevention, multiplying risks and conflicts, resulting in underdevelopment and the violation of human rights. And if we fail to reform the Security Council through a broad-based consensus we ignore the geopolitics of the twenty-first century, which at the very least requires the inclusion of representatives of the continent of Africa, Brazil and India.\nPortugal is a participant in conflict-prevention, peacebuilding, peacekeeping and institutional capacity- building operations in nine United Nations missions, six of which are in Africa. I  would  particularly like to highlight our presence in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic and in the United Nations Multidimensional  Integrated  Stabilization  Mission in Mali.\nWith respect  to  migration  and  refugees,  we need to understand the causes of the growth in mass movements of people, and we need dialogue among societies of origin, transit and destination. Portugal unreservedly supports the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, the global compact on refugees and the promotion of the right to education  in emergency situations. We have welcomed and will continue to welcome migrants, refugees and other displaced persons. Under our former President Jorge Sampaio, my country launched the Global Platform  for Syrian Students and calls for the broadest possible participation in the Rapid Response Mechanism for Higher Education in Emergencies.\nThe fight against terrorism has led to the creation of the Office of Counter-Terrorism, the first United Nations High-level Conference of Heads of Counter- Terrorism Agencies of Member States and a sixth United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy Review (resolution 72/284). The guarantee of justice for victims of serious international crimes is now one of the\n \ntasks of the International Criminal Court, which began to consider the crime of aggression in 2017, following a decision in which Portugal played an active role. With the support of more Member States, the Rome Statute, which created the Court, is expected to move towards universal adoption.\nWith regard to multilateralism and international law in the area of oceans and maritime security, Portugal is actively involved in preparations for the second United Nations Ocean Conference, in 2020, and stands ready to assume all responsibilities related to that. Maritime security is needed in places such as the coast of Somalia or the Gulf of Guinea, where Portugal is part of the European Union Naval Force Operation Atalanta within the framework of the European Union, and also in the Yaound\u00e9 process, together with the African Union and the countries of the region. And  we are going further, creating a centre in the Azores  as a platform for various international organizations working to protect the oceans. Global governance of the oceans, supported by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is a just cause.  For us, those are structural issues that we do not change to suit short-term trends and actors. We regard a healthy environment as a fundamental right; we support carbon neutrality by 2050 and, with Lebanon, we are jointly chairing the ad hoc open-ended working group with a view to drafting a global pact for the environment.\nThere are basically two different views of the world. One is short-term. It is unilateral or minilateral, protectionist and focused on populist domestic discourse. It minimizes the importance of multilateralism in anything to do with sustainable development, is prone to climate change denial, opposes global compacts on migration and refugees and is interested in conflict prevention and peacekeeping on the rare occasions when and where they suit it, and they are more likely to suit it when the emphasis is on economic rather than political power. The opposing view, which we share,  is multilateral, open, favourable to the quest for global governance, committed to sustainable development and respectful of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and human rights as values and principles, not as means or conveniences. We are confident that, in the medium to long term, that view will prevail, as it has in the European Union, which has given Europe  its longest period of peace in living memory and high levels of welfare and social protection.\nAs we celebrate the seventieth  anniversary  of  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Law Commission, it is an appropriate time to call for consensus on the adoption of the biennial resolution on the moratorium on the death penalty, which is to be submitted to the General Assembly.\nOur view of the global situation and the role of  the United Nations, which, as I said, is in complete agreement with the  view  of  the  Secretary-General, is based on our positions on those so-called regional questions that are global in scope. Let me now comment on some that are of particular relevance to Portugal.\nWe salute the strengthening of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) \u2014 currently chaired by Cabo Verde, to be followed by Angola\u2014whose contributions to stability and development I want to highlight. The CPLP enjoys an excellent cooperative relationship with the United Nations and pursues the goal of seeing the Portuguese language, one of the most widely spoken in the world, adopted as an official language of the United Nations.\nWe also commend the steps that have been taken in Guinea-Bissau in preparation for elections in November. We would like to highlight the increasing importance of the African Union and its key uniting role for peace and sustainable development, its growing partnership with the United Nations and the historic step of the signing of the Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is our hope that the elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be held in a safe, free and fair manner and that the results be respected by all.\nThe important developments on the Korean peninsula are opening up the prospects for its complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, demonstrating the commitment and courage of the parties involved, the contributions of regional partners of the United Nations and, above all, the role of diplomacy in bringing about world peace and security.\nWe note the signing of the maritime-boundary treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste under the auspices of the Secretary-General, confirming the effectiveness of the peaceful settlement of disputes through conciliation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nUnfortunately, some parts of the Middle East and the Maghreb continue to show signs of long-term\n \npolitical, social and economic instability. In Libya, the international community must come together to assist with the humanitarian and security situation and in establishing a robust State. Yemen remains the scene of one of the worst humanitarian crises today, where the most vulnerable \u2014 women and children \u2014 are especially badly affected. Only through a negotiated political solution mediated by the United Nations and with respect for international humanitarian law can we reverse that increasingly tragic situation.\nEqually tragic is the humanitarian  crisis  in Syria, with one of the largest  refugee  flows  ever seen in the region or beyond. In that case, too, only a substantive, inclusive political solution mediated by the United Nations can ensure effective and broad-based international support for reconstruction. The fact is that stability and peace in the Middle East will be possible only through the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Common sense demands the  resumption of  a credible negotiation process that addresses all the final-status issues, including the question of Jerusalem, and can lead to a viable two-State solution based on the coexistence of Israel and Palestine in peace and security.\nAs the Secretary-General suggested yesterday, true patriotism and cosmopolitanism are complementary. Portugal believes that multilateral action, political dialogue and diplomatic wisdom are the only possible path to harmonious coexistence among nations and peoples, and that very short-term perspectives, however appealing they may seem, are just a flash in the pan that will not last and will not solve the world\u2019s true problems.\nAs Nelson Mandela said, \u201cA fundamental concern for others in our individual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of.\u201d\nThat is the Organization\u2019s noble mission;  it  is  also the reason for Portugal\u2019s deep commitment to the United Nations. The United Nations represents neither a luxury nor a short-sighted trend, but rather a long- lasting universal need.\n"

        "file_text": "I am very grateful to be able to address the Assembly as a female Chancellor and Vice-President of the Republic of Costa Rica. I extend to the Assembly and the representatives of all countries a warm greeting from President Carlos Alvarado Quesada. My country is fully convinced that together we can build a different future with courage, determination, imagining the impossible and striving to achieve it. The  fact  that the Assembly is today presided over by a woman, the fourth to lead this forum in its 73 years of existence, is part of a new moment in history when equality between men and women is built on concrete acts. That is why my country welcomes her election and congratulates her. President Carlos Alvarado Quesada formed a gender-balanced cabinet in Costa Rica for the first time in its history, and the country today benefits from the talent, ability, knowledge and leadership of women in positions of power.\nWe thank the Secretary-General for the  impetus he has generated aimed at achieving gender parity within the United Nations system, and we reaffirm  our commitment to continue to support the specific measures proposed for that purpose. The economic empowerment of women is also of vital importance for women if they are to exercise their autonomy, while\ntheir incorporation into the labour market significantly and evidentially contributes to the economy and to families, communities and society in general. Costa Rica is convinced that it is necessary to continue to make progress in that area and is therefore co-chairing, together with the United Kingdom, the Group of Champions for Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment.\nOur country renounced its army 70 years ago, and since then our defence doctrines have been based on dialogue, negotiation between States and international law. That achievement is cherished by the Costa Rican people and one that we wish to share as we approach the bicentenary of our independence. The decisions that our leaders face do not involve renovating our military arsenals or engaging in strategic military alliances. Costa Rica is convinced of the need to ensure sustainable development in all three of its dimensions: social, economic and environmental; to promote inclusion and the universalization of access to opportunities; and to invest in education, health and housing, with particular attention to populations in vulnerable situations.\nCosta Rica believes in democracy, with a robust electoral system that guarantees that nobody can perpetually remain in power. Costa Rica is also convinced of  the need to protect human rights with    a modern legal system supported by advanced international conventions and inspired by the needs of those who have suffered discrimination and prejudice. Furthermore. Costa Rica is convinced of the need for individual freedom, protecting the right to expression, communication and information. Costa Rica expresses those commitments as a member of  the  community of nations, trusting in the protections afforded by international law and the standards of coexistence and avoiding any provocation from other countries.\nFor that reason, the United Nations, as the multilateral organization par excellence, occupies a special place in the hearts of Costa Ricans. There are those who protest against what they call interference by United Nations bodies, and others who refuse to pay their assessments and financial contributions. There are those who question United Nations institutions, and others who ignore its agreements. Costa Rica, for its part, reiterates the need for the United Nations as a strong, efficient, austere, robust and transparent organization that is committed to sustainable development, dialogue, peace, human rights and protecting the norms of international law. It is not only  for  Costa Rica, but  for many countries and communities as well, that the\n \nUnited Nations represents the last glimmer of hope, and we cannot fail them.\nCosta Rica condemns terrorism and violent extremism, which is conducive to terrorism. Women and girls suffer the greatest consequences, and in some cases those consequences are indelible. Peacebuilding must be a sustained effort. We firmly believe in fostering a culture of peace through the promotion of justice, democratic participation, human rights and education, and we reject all types of violence and recognize the important task of preventing the causes of conflicts.\nSince 2017, Costa Rica has proudly and with a great sense of responsibility formed part of the group of countries that contribute on the ground under the banner of the United Nations. My country welcomes the participation of Costa Rican women police officers as international observers in the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia. We recognize the efforts of the Mission to incorporate an approach based on gender equality. We call for an end to impunity for the most serious crimes. In that connection, we reaffirm our support for the mandate of the International Criminal Court, and we call on those who have made the decision to withdraw from the Court to return to the cause of international criminal law. We strongly support that Court as a legitimate tool for international justice that should be strengthened, because the victims deserve justice, especially in cases where their national systems are not able to provide it.\nIt is also important to reiterate that sexual violence is always unacceptable. However, what is particularly concerning is its widespread use as a tactic of terror and weapon of war and terrorism, where it is used as one of the most cruel and terrible forms of social coercion; a strategy to control and intimidate entire communities, deeply affecting people\u2019s dignity and autonomy. Cases of sexual exploitation and abuse have irreparable consequences for the persons affected.  We  support the zero-tolerance policy on abuse in that regard. We reiterate our condemnation of such abuse committed by the staff of this Organization, which damages its credibility, impedes the appropriate  implementation of mandates and creates excuses for those who want to destroy multilateralism.\nWe welcome the Panmunjom Declaration and the Pyongyang Declaration, and we are hopeful that they will lead to effective implementation and the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We also\nexpress our support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, endorsed by the Security Council. We also celebrate the historic peace agreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia. We once again join the international community in calling for the lifting of the blockade against Cuba, which has been in effect for far too many years, affecting the ability of its population to generate development and prosperity.\nCosta Rica dreamed of being a country without an army, and for 70 years now that has been a reality. We were also at the forefront of the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty, and today we promote its implementation. Now, together with a group of States and civil society organizations, we are trying to devise a world without nuclear weapons. In our view, the only way to ensure that nuclear weapons are never used again under any circumstances is through their total elimination. With the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the international community decided that the legally binding prohibition of those weapons is a fundamental contribution to the accomplishment of that objective. With deep conviction and a sense of ethics, we call today on all countries to sign and ratify that historic Treaty.\nCosta Rica cannot and will not be indifferent to the suffering of and uncertainty facing those we consider our brothers and sisters. Since April, we have expressed our concern at the deterioration of institutions and the systematic erosion of human rights in Nicaragua, as has been confirmed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Selective repression, intimidation and criminalization have undermined the freedoms of its population one by one. We must mention that the grave situation in Nicaragua has claimed several hundred human lives. As a result, our country has experienced an increase in migratory flows and refugee applications.  We  have  responded in an orderly, responsible and supportive manner, prioritizing the protection, respect, dignity and security of the people. However, it is clear that Costa Rica alone cannot carry that burden.\nThe situation in Nicaragua is not sustainable. Dialogue remains suspended, seemingly indefinitely, and the Government has expelled the delegation of   the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The  crisis  in  that  country  has the potential to escalate, with a direct impact on the stability and development of all of Central America. Costa Rica reiterates its conviction that only committed\n \nand effective dialogue between all parties, leading to a genuine agreement on a timetable for democratization, can be the solution to the conflict that is  afflicting our brother country. Today, we ask the international community and the Secretary-General to participate in preventive diplomacy and mediation in the face of that serious situation. When it comes to the lives and dignity of people and the lack of possibility for them to live free from fear and misery, silence makes us accomplices. That is why Costa Rica is speaking out.\nWe reiterate our concern at the situation in Venezuela and the lack of respect for the rule of law and Venezuelan institutions in that country, as well as the violations of human rights there. Costa Rica has consistently supported the international community in its efforts in that regard, including those made this week in the Human Rights Council in Geneva. We reaffirm our commitment to contributing to overcoming the serious political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, through a peaceful and negotiated solution, within the framework of international law.\nThis year will be of particular importance in building a consensus that will allow us to reach a global  framework  of  cooperation,  so  that  we   can at least achieve safe, orderly and regular migration with the adoption of a global compact on migration and another on refugees. Costa Rica welcomes that possibility with enthusiasm. Only with constant coordination and cooperation, including with those countries that responsibly receive flows of migrants and refugees \u2014 especially if they are developing countries \u2014 will we be able to manage human mobility in a way that enhances its positive effects. It is essential to deepen our approach to human mobility, a global and complex phenomenon of great relevance, which should also become one of the key points on the international agenda. We need a common, comprehensive and long- term vision of migration and refuge-seeking,  based on sovereignty, joint responsibility in its governance and, above all, solidarity. Let us create a world where diversity, identity and culture are understood as a source of wealth and growth.\nCosta Rica draws attention to the International Decade for People of  African Descent, which began  in January 2015. In 2020, we will have  a  review at  the mid-point of the Decade, but we  know  already that we have not made sufficient progress. We require the necessary resources, as mandated by the General Assembly, in order to take concrete measures to\nrecognize the contributions  of  that  population  and to respect, protect and realize their fundamental rights. Costa Rica also welcomes the adoption of the Decade of Family Farming, which aims to  improve the working and living conditions of family farmers  so they can contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Family farming is linked to the sustainable production and consumption of food and to the cultural events of our population. We invite all countries to take action, both nationally and internationally, in order to realize the aspirations of the Decade.\nIt is imperative to ensure compliance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Administration of President Carlos Alvarado Quesada maintains its commitment to the national pact for the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, which  was  signed  in  2016  by  the  public  sector,  the business sector, workers\u2019 organizations, civil society organizations, faith-based organizations, social organizations and local governments. Costa Rica recognizes the comprehensive, universal, transformative and multidimensional nature of the SDGs. We consider it essential that, in order to fulfil the 2030 Agenda, we fully acknowledge the concept  of the multidimensionality of poverty, as required by  a thorough response from the international community and the United Nations system, so that middle-income countries can continue to access finance and ensure the closing of the structural gaps that persist and hamper our efforts to achieve sustainable development.\nWe are currently working on a decarbonization plan that is innovative, decisive and committed, with  a long-term vision and a set of immediate actions that require transformational efforts in our society. The plan identifies a series of technological transformations, such as efficient and renewable public transport, a fleet of zero-emission light vehicles, integrated waste management and low-emission waste disposal, highly efficient agri-food systems that generate low-carbon foodstuffs, a model of livestock development that is resilient and eco-competitive based on productive efficiency and an increase in forest cover and ecosystem services rooted in nature-based solutions. The decarbonization of our society is the greatest task of our generation. Costa Rica aspires to become a laboratory in the process of the extensive decarbonization of the world economy. Just as we once abolished our army, we are now going to abolish our dependence on fossil\n \nfuels. We are determined to do everything necessary and, with the collaboration of us all, it will happen.\nIn that regard, Costa Rica invites all Member States to participate in a new initiative, namely, the coalition for all.  This  coalition  seeks  to  promote the integration of the language of human rights and gender into multilateral environmental agreements and environmental financial mechanisms in an articulated and consistent manner. This week,  we also signed the Escaz\u00fa Agreement,  also  known  as the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean. That innovative international instrument, for which Costa Rica co-chaired the negotiation process, represents the contribution of our region to environmental democracy and the construction of a more sustainable and more inclusive world.\nGreat transformations need not wait. We can be part of a new generation of light made up of innovative and committed people with an inspiring vision of our potential as a society and determined to promote a positive global transformation. It is time to forge a more sustainable, fairer, freer and more inclusive future. Costa Rica believes that all nations around the world share those aspirations. In any case,  the  Assembly can count on the full assistance of Costa  Rica  to  work in that direction with anyone willing to believe that we are all obliged to deliver a better planet to the coming generations.\nIt is true that we have witnessed global and national events that seem to highlight setbacks in terms of peace and human rights and even actions that seem contrary to sustainable development, but that fact must not discourage us. One era dies, and another is born. It dies at this moment in history. It is time to celebrate the fact that young leaders from all over the world are moving to promote rights and build better societies. Today, we have a committed, passionate and compassionate youth that often renounces its own comfort to promote and protect the rights of others. I have called that generation the \u201cgeneration of light\u201d, because it rescues the best of the past and the best of the achievements of humankind, and the commitment to the environment, society, peace and well-being. It is a generation that looks to the future without fear and is rallying for a new world without weapons or violence, for the environment, for peace, for human rights, for sexual diversity, against any type\nof discrimination and in favour of a better world. The generation of light will undoubtedly change the world."

Human beings tend to look to the past to find similarities in order to predict the future, because we are, inescapably and permanently, governed by cause and effect.\nWe, the rulers, leaders and decision-makers, have an immense responsibility to alter the way in which the world perceives its future. Our peoples must understand that causality is not inevitability. On the contrary, people have the ability to change their circumstances. In order for them to do so, the international policies that are shaped here, in the most important of the world\u2019s forums, must help us to empower our societies and to conceive of history as something that we can change. Policies are successful when they seek to resolve everyone\u2019s personal stories, especially those of the poorest, neediest and most disenfranchised \u2014 because we are nations united to change the history of peoples.\nOur Government plan is called A Whole Life, because that is who we are and what we do. At the end of the day, we have a whole life to be right and wrong, to dream, to build and to love. It is up to us to analyse and manage the consequences. The plan is called A Whole Life because we want to attend to human beings from the moment of conception to the moment that God decides to close their eyes \u2014 to their departure. Depending on where each person is in his or her life cycle, our attention could involve care, inspiration, encouragement, support or gratitude.\nCare and inspiration are more appropriate for the first stage. Caring for mothers and children, before and after birth, and looking after that child during its first 1,000 days of life is a mission of warmth.\nThen comes the stage of inspiring  those  little ones to enjoy themselves, to play, to study and to be happy. We must teach them to love science and to be passionate about technology. It is important to study, but it is perhaps more constructive and enlightening to be creative, to love research, to indulge one\u2019s imagination, to explore the challenges of technology, to continuously cultivate one\u2019s values and to never stop playing and\n \nexperimenting with colours, sounds, smells, textures, flavours and knowledge.\nAfter that comes encouragement, aimed at offering young people knowledge that will serve them in the future, in their professional career, and at encouraging them to be enterprising and to hold themselves in high esteem. We must make their future more transparent and less complicated. We must help them learn to love life and to discover the beauty of their environment,  so that they are never forced to seek satisfaction or security in foreign substances. We must encourage them with praise, with greater participation and with confidence in their abilities and their dreams.\nSupport is for the adult, perhaps. We support adults in their efforts to get jobs, build families and succeed in their endeavours aimed at ensuring social and personal security and, above all, to put a roof over their heads. We have called that mission A House for All.\nFinally comes gratitude, which seeks to  enable our elders to live out their lives knowing that their society appreciates what they have done. Let them live surrounded by love, company and care, so that those years can be their best.\nSomeone once asked me how these proposals were born, and I  answered with several maybes. Maybe it  is because I was born and spent my childhood in the heart of the Amazon, the lung of the world, in the most diverse tropical rainforest on the planet. There I became familiar with the deep problems of an abandoned region. I could see how precarious health and life was without minimum coverage for human beings. Many children died, and many mothers perished with them.\nWithin the framework of the General Assembly, two fundamental health issues will be addressed at the highest level \u2014 tuberculosis and non-transmissible diseases. It is my hope and Ecuador\u2019s commitment, above all, that those discussions will lead to agreements for and commitments to concrete action. It is scandalous, unjust and immoral that access to life-saving medicines is often limited  because  intellectual  property  and the profits of the big pharmaceutical companies are favoured over a universal right to health. It is that  kind of discussion that enables the United Nations to have meaning in the daily lives of the world\u2019s citizens. The more we strive to enable our United Nations to touch people\u2019s lives, the more we will strengthen the Organization for the future.\nMaybe it is because, after several years of playing in my neighbourhood, surrounded by supportive neighbours, I learned the value of community life. We would visit people\u2019s homes, the neighbours took care of us, we helped one other in all circumstances and we celebrated our achievements in community. In fact, the ideal of shared peace and life was also the genesis of the United Nations.\nWe cannot forget that this must be the heart of the discussion of the large and small problems existing among countries, and that, within the framework of that discussion, we must call for  ongoing  dialogue,  as mentioned by President Temer, for  reciprocity as an institution, for strengthening multilateralism, for listening to one another in dialogue, but above all, for listening to those who live in situations that we wish to analyse, address and solve.\nMaybe it is because when I was young, I and other colleagues had excellent ideas, but lacked both the knowledge and the capacity to carry out our hopes. We therefore had to live through the anguish of not having start-up capital for our businesses, and we suffered long nights when monthly payments were due, while also struggling to pay our workers. We learned at first hand not to allow ourselves to be undervalued for being young. We learned the decisive role of private enterprise. We understood that entrepreneurship is a value that generates production, wealth, employment, well-being, self-esteem and freedom.\nToday,  the  private  sector  in  the  global  arena  is more aware of its role \u2014 extending far beyond profit, production and employment. Today, large, medium-sized and small enterprises have thousands of communicating vessels, which, by understanding their purpose, which is to ensure well-being in their daily actions, can be key actors for global action to promote peace and prosperity. In that connection, we must together keep the commitments we have undertaken, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which promotes partnership as a core element.\nMaybe it is because 20 years ago, I was assaulted and lost the use of my  legs. As those present can see,  I am wheelchair-bound. Is that bad? I do not know. Chinese wisdom says that things are neither so bad, nor so good. It was bad because returning home from the hospital was hard; there were no more intravenous tubes or painkillers, but rather a constant and persistent pain. I was reminded of Francis of Assisi, who spoke\n \nof the pain of another, because I found that there are other, and perhaps even greater, pains. It was also good because now, from my wheelchair, I see at the height of the heart. When people have legs, they see straight and upwards. Whereas from a wheelchair, we see horizontally and downwards, and as such, we discover other realities and worlds. We see those who encounter obstacles impeding them in their efforts to move forward, to continue, and even to live \u2014 obstacles of varying types: mistreatment, xenophobia, racism, injustice, machismo and inequity, in other words, exclusion. That story is not just my story; it is the story of 1 billion people around the world.\nI welcome the fact that one of the main topics to be addressed is the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The implementation of that Convention and its Optional Protocol is the best guarantee that, together, we will fulfil a pending commitment. In that regard, Ecuador is honoured to hold the presidency of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention for the next two years.\nFrom that position, we will contribute to the promotion and protection of the rights  of  persons with disabilities, as well as step up efforts already in motion to achieve greater accessibility, with a view to enabling the United Nations to become truly inclusive. We are not only talking about physical accessibility, but also about having people with disabilities and their rights be considered in all United Nations discussions, resolutions and initiatives.\nMaybe because now, just as in the past, as I travel around my country and the world, I see exclusion and injustice. We exclude the different, the poor, the elderly, the young. We mistreat women, girls and indigenous people. There are so many abandoned and forgotten brothers and sisters. Many people simply pass by, without even noticing their presence. As States Members of the United Nations we cannot allow indolence and idleness, misery and injustice to continue to be part of the daily landscape. That is what the Sustainable Development Goals draw attention to. They are a fundamental part of the programme that my Government has proposed to the Ecuadorian people, which we have called, and I will repeat, A Whole Life.\nMaybe because it is evident to me that we want to be happy throughout life, and that is why we govern. We are here in a great country. The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, written by Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, states in its famous second sentence,\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit  of happiness\u201d.\nWhat a phrase \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d is. That sentence inspired, inter alia, the Constitution of this great country \u2014 a reference for the world that inspires scientific research and development.\nFor that reason, and maybe because we always follow world events closely, we do not  understand  how a country like this one can blockade an almost defenceless people such as Cuba. It is impossible for us to understand blockades against others, including possibly their rights to life, freedom and  the  pursuit of happiness.\nMaybe because we were young idealists and we continue to be dissatisfied adults, we do not understand how the great Powers can spend their resources on weapons, instead of investing in the development of peoples. For that reason, perhaps, we do not understand how those countries that have achieved development and superiority in armaments and have also felt the pain of war through their own children can intervene in other people\u2019s conflicts, not with a view to helping to resolve them, but to the contrary, to aggravate, and even perpetuate, them.\nMaybe because when unscrupulous bankers raided the pockets of Ecuadorians, we saw families and children left helpless and turn to migration. When Governments deviate from their objective of caring for the poorest and the most vulnerable, those people seek better opportunities outside of and far from their own land. No one abandons their beloved land voluntarily.\nIn Ecuador, we receive an inflow of at least 6,000 Venezuelan brothers and sisters daily. The children arrive with measles, diphtheria and polio, and pregnant women arrive never having had a check-up. We have earmarked more than 50,000 vaccines for those beautiful and defenceless children, and we have carried out tens of thousands of health check-ups on the more than 1 million brothers and sisters who have left their homes in search of better luck in the largest diaspora in the history of our continent.\n \nWe have urged the Venezuelan Government and people to resolve their crisis, as they should, through  a candid and inclusive national dialogue. We recently invited the brother countries of the region to practice solidarity, in a practical and integrated manner, with the Venezuelan migrants, displaced persons and refugees. We do not want our countries to be left standing alone merely with diplomatic statements. We want continent- wide action to find a structural solution to the problems of our fraternal people of Venezuela. I reiterate that no one migrates of their own volition. They do so because they are forced to be uprooted and to painfully distance themselves from their families and emotions.\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed said that when a people emigrates, their rulers are the leftovers. There are plenty who prolong their stay in power and become dark, sinister Governments with corrupt mafias. And just as we are in solidarity with those who come to us, we also invite our own long-departed to return to their place of birth and reintegrate into the big family that is their country.\nThe global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration was adopted by Ecuador in July and will be adopted at the global level in December in Morocco. We cannot let that compact become a dead letter. We must keep in mind that inclusion has no borders, and that the rights of others to life and happiness do not end where mine begin. Both rights are an inherent part of human beings. They are interdependent and enriched by being interwoven through cohabitation.\nWith regard to the Venezuelan crisis \u2014 or that which Nicaragua is experiencing \u2014 our Latin America has the great challenge of strengthening its democracy after various countries have endured authoritarian, corrupt and populist Governments. The history of the United Nations is the history of a  common pact for  the preservation of the human rights of the citizens of the world.\nRights can be guaranteed  only within the framework of solid institutions, with ample freedom of expression and transitions of power, which are the fundamental elements of solid democracies and must be the commitment of our nations in order to build those democracies, care for them and treasure them. My Government maintains its democratic commitment and, in each of its actions and decisions, preserves its commitment to the original ideals of our United Nations.\nThe late Kofi Annan, a great man who left so many important lessons,  said  that,  in  the  face  of growing cynicism about democracy, we should not give up but rather defend and advocate for the values and virtues of democracy.\nMadam President, our dear friend and colleague Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa, you are the first Latin American woman to preside over the Assembly. Ecuador is grateful for the support of our sister nations in your election, and we are aware of the immense responsibility that you have at the helm of this global forum.\nWe will all support work aimed at ensuring that the United Nations is relevant to our peoples. We are the Organization that unites our nations in their concerns and their aspirations. We see the international efforts made by the United Nations to care for us, for our children and for our neighbours. That is why we support its plan for disarmament; that is why we support the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and why we promote the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol (resolution 61/106), along with a lenghty list of other actions, commitments and decisions.\nThe United Nations is our Organization. If there are flaws in it, let us correct them. We must not try to disrupt it nor revoke funding from it, because we must strengthen it if we want to provide our children with a bright future. If we are going to create complementary organizations \u2014 for example, in order to  bolster  trade systems or specific regional projects on culture, education or sport \u2014 these are most welcome, so long as their objectives are to strengthen the global union, to implement the Sustainable Development Goals and to honour all the historic commitments that we have undersigned. However, we do not believe in, nor should we use, regional organizations to defend anachronistic, perverse and dictatorial systems, some of which were born and then, fortunately, died in recent decades.\nThis institution is the most important living symbol of the world\u2019s commitment to peace. For years we have often spoken at length about peace, but no one has been able to surpass Gandhi\u2019s definition of peace as the sole path for humankind.\nPeace is our right. It is a sine qua non condition for life and happiness. Ecuador is currently experiencing serious problems affecting our internal peace owing to violence on the northern border. We benefit greatly from mutual help from the President  of  Colombia, our dear friend Ivan Duque. We are also dealing with\n \ninternational crime and drug trafficking, and we have made a commitment to put an end to them.\nAs each cause will have its effect, and each effect continues to transform itself into yet another cause,  we know that working for world peace is a constant obligation. This is because it has not yet fully taken root in the heart of every human being. As a father and a grandfather, I know that there will be no  peace, if we do not inculcate the proper values throughout our peoples\u2019 lives. I know that kindness, for example, is not a matter of public interest, and civility, honesty and transparency are not subjects taught in schools and universities, but  they must be instilled in the hearts of all human beings. Otherwise, we will never lay the foundations for a peaceful coexistence \u2014 the very goal of our Organization, which welcomes us today.\nAs a native of the Amazon region, I know very well that there will be no peace if we do not preserve the planet. We must regard the jungle not as simply  the lungs but as the heart of our world. As a person with disabilities, I know that there will be no peace if we do not embrace inclusion and celebrate diversity. Diversity does not mean suffering; diversity means living and enjoying it. As a President, I know that peace is definitively favourable for those who are poorest and is crucial for those who are most in need. Peace ensures that everyone, without exception, is free to realize their dreams every day for the rest of their lives.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the United Kingdom, let me begin by paying tribute to an outstanding leader of the United Nations, who, sadly, passed away this summer. Kofi Annan was one of the great Secretaries-General, a tireless campaigner for peace and progress and a champion of human rights and human dignity, whose influence will continue to be felt around the world for years to come. Over the course of his lifetime he witnessed the extraordinary progress that we as a community of nations have made since the Organization was founded: progress in which we have more than halved the number of people living in extreme poverty in this century alone; progress in which the number of people killed in conflicts has fallen by three quarters in just over three decades; and progress in which millions of our citizens lead healthier and longer lives and where, thanks to advances in human knowledge, medicine, science and technology, we are presented with huge opportunities in the years ahead. Yet today many are concerned about whether or not that progress will continue and fearful about what the future holds.\nFor the end of the Cold War did not, as many once believed, lead to the inevitable supremacy of open economies and liberal democracies cooperating on the global stage for the common good. Today, instead, we face a loss of confidence in those very systems that have delivered so much. The belief in free markets has been challenged by the financial crisis of 2008, the concerns of those feeling left behind by globalization, the anxieties about the pace and scale of technological change and what that will mean for jobs and the unprecedented mass movements of people across borders, with all the pressures that can bring. And after the military interventionism at the beginning of the century, people question the rationale, and indeed legitimacy, of the use of force and involving ourselves in crises and conflicts that are not ours, while at the same time being repelled by the slaughter in Syria and our failure to end it.\nSuch doubts are entirely understandable; so too is the demand for leadership. Those of us who believe in inclusive societies and open economies have a duty to respond, learn the lessons of the past, meet people\u2019s concerns with practical actions, not beguiling illusions, and renew our confidence in the ideas and values that have done so much to benefit so many for so long. For be in no doubt, if we lack the confidence to step up, others will.\nIn the last century, whether in the rise of fascism or the spread of communism, we have seen those on the extreme right and extreme left exploit people\u2019s fears, stoke intolerance and racism, close down economies and societies and destroy the peace of nations. And today, once more, we see worrying trends in the rise of such movements in Europe and beyond. We have seen what happens when countries slide into authoritarianism, slowly crushing the basic freedoms and rights of their citizens. We have seen what happens when corrupt oligarchies rob their nations of the wealth, resources and human capital that are so vital to unlocking a brighter future for their citizens.\nWe have seen what happens when the natural patriotism that is a cornerstone of a healthy society is warped into aggressive nationalism, exploiting fear and\n \nuncertainty to promote identity politics at home and belligerent confrontation abroad, while breaking rules and undermining institutions. We see what happens when States like Russia flagrantly breach international norms \u2014 from the seizing of sovereign territory to the reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of Britain by agents of the Russian GRU. We have to show there is a better way to meet the concerns of our people. That way lies in global cooperation between strong and accountable States based on open economies and inclusive societies. It is a way that ensures that strong nation States provide the bonds that bring citizens together and that power remains accountable to those it is there to serve; that celebrates free markets and has the confidence to reform them when they need to work better; and that demonstrates that delivering for one\u2019s citizens at home does not have to be at the expense of global cooperation and the values, rules and ideals that underpin that.\nIndeed, cooperation and competition are not mutually exclusive. Only global cooperation based on a set of agreed rules can ensure competition is fair and does not succumb to protectionism, with its certain path to lost jobs and international confrontation. It is only global cooperation that can harness legitimate self- interest towards common goals, producing agreements on global challenges, such as climate change and proliferation, and increasing inclusive economic growth. We see that cooperation here today at the United Nations, as we also saw it at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting earlier this year. And here today, as Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth, I deliver a clear statement on behalf of the Heads of Government of its 53 equal and independent member States. We reaffirm our shared commitment to working together within a rules-based international system to address shared global challenges and foster a fairer, more secure, more sustainable and more prosperous future. That commitment takes account of the special requirements of the least developed countries and of small and otherwise vulnerable economies and benefits all our citizens and the wider world.\nBut it is not enough for us merely to make the case for cooperation. We need action, at home and in the community of nations, to show how our ideas and values can deliver practical benefits for all our people in all parts of the world. We must recognize the legitimacy of people\u2019s concerns and act to build a global economy that works for everyone. We must invest in the patient\nwork of building open societies in which everyone has a stake in the future. And we must act to uphold the international rules-based system and stand up for our values by protecting those who may suffer when it is violated. Let me take each in turn.\nFirst, we must respond to those who feel that the global economy is not working for them; the pace of globalization that has left too many people behind; the fear that our children and grandchildren may lack the education and skills to secure the jobs of tomorrow; and the risk that technological change could become   a source of inequality and division rather than the greatest opportunity in history. In the United Kingdom we are driving investment in industries of the  future to create new jobs, from low-carbon technologies to artificial intelligence. We are investing in education and skills so that workers are ready to make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead. And we are making sure people play by the rules so that business and innovation is celebrated for creating jobs, not demonized because of grievances over tax not paid or rights not respected.\nWhile we strive to make our own economies work for all our people, we should do the same at a global level. In an increasingly global economy, it is not enough to ensure people play by the rules at home. We need global cooperation to set and enforce fair rules on trade, tax and the sharing of data. And those rules need to keep pace with the changing nature of trade and technology. We need to give the World Trade Organization a broad, ambitious and urgent mandate to reform. It must address the areas where it is not functioning effectively, deal with issues that are not currently covered and maintain trust in a system that is critical to preventing a return to the failed protectionism of the past.\nFair and respected rules are essential for business to flourish and drive growth. But recent history shows that that cannot be sustained without deeper partnerships among Governments, business, international financial institutions and civil society to ensure that growth delivers for everyone. That is why I recently visited Africa, along with British businesses, to promote trade and investment and encourage a new partnership based on shared prosperity and shared security. It is why at this General Assembly session I co-hosted an event with Prime Minister Trudeau, President Kagame and President Akufo-Addo, calling for more support for investment and job creation for young people on the continent. It is why the United Kingdom will maintain its commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of gross\n \nnational income on official development assistance and put our development budget at the heart of our international agenda. We will do more to create jobs, improve skills and increase investment in emerging economies \u2014 in both our interests and theirs, for the best way of resisting protectionism is to ensure that this century is defined by open markets that really deliver for all our people.\nSecondly, we must build countries, not only economies, that work for everyone: inclusive societies where every citizen has a stake in the future. Those are the firm foundations on which strong and accountable nations are built. History has consistently taught us that giving people a stake in society is the best way to ensure stability, security and economic growth. There is no one right way to do this. Every country must choose its own path, but the basic tenets are common across the world. They include a Government that is transparent and accountable, an independent judiciary to enforce the rule of law, free and fair elections and a free and open media. They also include freedom of expression, a right to redress, property rights that are reliably enforced, equality, freedom of thought, opinion, religion and conscience \u2014 all found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed 70 years ago.\nThose of us who believe in those tenets must set  an example in defending and strengthening them at home and abroad. That is why we must call out hate speech, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia  and  all  forms of prejudice and discrimination against minorities wherever we find  it.  Like  many  leaders,  I  suspect, I do not always enjoy reading what the media in my country writes about me. But I will defend their right to say it, for the independence of our media is one of my country\u2019s greatest achievements and it is the bedrock of our democracy.\nSo, too, will I defend objectivity and impartiality in the face of those who treat truth as just another opinion to be manipulated. This challenge has only become more complex with the rise in social media and online information. That is why we agreed at the Group of Seven (G-7) Summit in June to step up  our efforts to respond to disinformation and why, together with our partners and with technology companies, we are leading efforts to reclaim the Internet from terrorists and others who would do us harm.\nJust as we must stand up for the values that we adhere to, so we must support countries and leaders who\nchoose to take the often difficult steps towards a more inclusive society. The United Kingdom will use all the levers at its disposal to do so. Through our aid budget and commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, we will not only protect the most vulnerable, but also bolster States under threat and help others sustain their progress. Through global campaigns, we will help countries to end scourges such as modern slavery and sexual violence in conflict, and we will mobilize wider support through our alliances and membership of multilateral organizations \u2014 not only the United Nations, but also international financial institutions, the G-7, the Group of 20 and NATO.\nJust as there is no single recipe for an inclusive society, so there is no single model for balancing the democratic demands of our public with the imperative to cooperate internationally. The vote by the British people to leave the European Union (EU) was not a rejection of multilateralism or international cooperation; it was a clear demand for decisions and accountability to lie closer to home. I believe the role of leadership   in these circumstances is clear: it is delivering on the democratic wishes of our people and international cooperation, working with allies and partners in pursuit of our shared values.\nThirdly, we must have the will and confidence to act when the fundamental rules that we live by are broken. This is not about repeating the mistakes of the past by trying to impose democracy on other countries through regime change, but we should not allow those mistakes to prevent us from protecting people in the face of the worst violations of human rights and human dignity. We should not allow those mistakes to paralyse the international community when its long-established norms are violated. We should not let our inability to prevent some of the worst conflicts today stop us from making every effort to ensure they do not happen again in future. If we stand back, we allow the world to become divided into spheres of influence in which the powerful dominate the weak and in which legitimate grievances go unaddressed. This is not just a moral imperative \u2014 it is also a matter of self-interest, for when barbarous acts and aggression go unchecked, dictators and terrorists are emboldened.\nWe must therefore have the confidence to act. When the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on its people again in April, it was Britain \u2014 together with France and America \u2014 that took military action to degrade the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical-weapons capability and\n \ndeter their use. Earlier this year, when Russia used a toxic nerve agent in a sickening attack on the streets  of Salisbury, the United Kingdom, with our NATO, EU and other allies, took action, expelling over 150 Russian intelligence officers in the largest collective expulsion ever.\nIn Burma, following the damning report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, we should sow the same  confidence  to hold accountable those responsible for the appalling atrocities repeatedly inflicted by the Burmese military on the Rohingya, Shan and Kachin peoples since 2011. Similarly, we should gather evidence of Da\u2019esh\u2019s crimes worldwide, show ensuring justice for their victims and deterring those who might conduct such crimes in the future. But accountability alone is not enough. We must do more collectively to prevent such atrocities in the first place and address the causes of instability that can give rise to them.\nThe United Nations has a critical  role  to  play, and it has a wide range of levers to do so, from sanctions \u2014 which show the leaders of Iran and North Korea that they cannot act without consequence \u2014 to peacekeeping missions, such as that in South Sudan, which is helping to prevent suffering and the collapse of law and order. To be able to effectively use those levers, the Security Council must find the political  will  to act in our collective interest. United Nations agencies must deliver the reforms that the Secretary-General has started to become more agile, more transparent and better coordinated on the ground. To support those reforms, we must also ensure proper funding is targeted specifically at those parts of the United Nations that deliver results.\nSeventy years ago, the General Assembly agreed the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights.  Today we must renew the ideals and values on which that Declaration was founded. In doing so, we must learn the lessons of the past and show through our actions how cooperation between strong and accountable States with open economies and inclusive societies can best deliver security and prosperity for all our people. As Kofi Annan said at the start of his second term as Secretary-General,\n\u201cI have sought to turn an unflinching eye to the failures of our recent past, in order to assess more clearly what it will take for us to succeed in the future.\u201d (A/55/PV.105, p.3)\nIn that spirit, let us show unflinching resolve to renew the promise of freedom, opportunity and fairness, a promise that has delivered for more people, in more places, than at any other period in our history. Let us ensure that promise can be fulfilled for our children and grandchildren and for every generation to come."

        "file_text": "I believe we should appreciate the fact that the theme of this year\u2019s general debate deals with global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. It is comprehensive and provides food for thought on the direction in which our world should develop \u2014 and this international Organization along with it.\nGlobal leadership is, first and foremost, a great responsibility. In order for us to achieve sustainability and standards  of  living  that  uphold  the   principle of dignity for every human being on the planet, it is absolutely crucial that we demonstrate our commitment and unity as we face the challenges of our time. I am convinced that we are all aware that we need to act with determination and unity in sharing the responsibility to ensure peace, equality and the  sustainability  of our communities.\nThe Republic of Bulgaria has worked constantly and actively to sustain a world order based on the rule of law and to reaffirm the principles of multilateral cooperation. That is why I would like to highlight that it is the destiny of the United Nations to play a central role in that effort, and we therefore actively support the Organization in its efforts.\n \nThe main global challenges, such as conflict resolution and peacekeeping, strengthening global security and stability, countering climate change, terrorism and ever-deepening inequality, cannot be addressed by one country alone. Those challenges require shared responsibility and everyone\u2019s contribution.\nGlobal peace and security depend on the stability and sustainable development of the various parts of our globalized world. Every country, large or small, has the responsibility and capacity to make a significant contribution to security and prosperity in the region in which it is located. For example, this past Monday, at the high-level event on the global drug problem organized by President Trump, every participating country made a firm commitment to fighting that global scourge. It was not by chance that Bulgaria was one of the co-hosts of that event. We have already pledged and proven our commitment to fighting the drug problem  through our actions. Even as we speak, Bulgarian customs authorities and prosecutors have managed to seize hundreds of kilogrammes of drugs, making my country a positive example. In order to achieve peace, security and stability, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals, we all need to take more actions of that kind.\nThe United Nations plays an integral part in promoting the fair use of global opportunities for the benefit of all. Inclusive and sustainable global growth underpins the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which are universal in nature and closely interlinked, is the key to addressing our current global challenges.\nDuring the first half of this year, the Bulgarian presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) invested considerable efforts in achieving marked progress and consensus among member States on the main goals of the 2030 Agenda. We are proud that during our six-month tenure of the presidency, the European Union adopted a mandate to start negotiations for the signing of a new partnership agreement with 79 countries from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The negotiations seek to achieve a modern, dynamic partnership with those countries as an important instrument in tackling global challenges, ranging from poverty and inequality to the promotion of peace and sustainable development for all.\nAllow me to highlight some of the idiosyncrasies of the region in which my country, Bulgaria, is situated.\nThis year we mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, which serves to remind us of the importance of the Balkans in the past as well as the relevance of the region in the present day. The Balkans have often been the source of conflicts and to this day the embers of some in that area continue to burn.\nDespite the circumstances and obstacles they face, the countries of South-Eastern Europe, especially those in the Western Balkans, have managed to make remarkable progress on important and much debated issues. It took several decades to reach the current state of affairs, which is why we should not hesitate any further to offer the international community\u2019s unequivocal political support to every State or initiative that deserves support.\nCompelling proof of the progress made by the Western Balkan countries can be seen in the recent signing of agreements  between  Sofia  and  Skopje,  as well as that between Athens and Skopje. Those agreements are crucial steps towards stability and security in South-Eastern Europe and towards the Euro- Atlantic prospects of the Western Balkan countries. The agreement between Podgorica and  Pristina  on the border demarcation, which just came into force, is also a significant milestone. Those documents not only show but also help to create the new spirit of relations between and among the countries of that region.\nI will provide one more example. Based on the historic opportunity that the rotating presidency  of the Council of the EU offered us, Bulgaria initiated a process that put the Western Balkans back on the agenda of European politics. Opportunities for cooperation and the participation of countries from outside the region in the construction of the new Balkan infrastructure have already started to attract interest and investments.\nAn  important  and emblematic  expression  of that process was the Leaders\u2019 Summit of the States members of the EU and the Western Balkan countries in our capital, Sofia, in May this year. That was the first meeting of its kind since the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003. Connectivity in all its dimensions was the focus of the discussion, as was the joint response of the young and relatively small Balkan States to the common challenges to security that we all face, such as irregular migration, organized crime, terrorism, hybrid threats, cybersecurity and misinformation. The Sofia Declaration adopted at the Summit reaffirmed the\n \nEuropean prospects for the region and made them an achievable goal.\nWe are aware that that is just the beginning of a new path that is encouraging but neither easy nor quick. However, the stakes are high, not only for the citizens of those countries and for their EU neighbours and friends, but also for the global processes aimed at economic and political strengthening and development. We cannot leave blank spots marked by lagging development, weak economies and societies susceptible to the present global threats.\nIn two days\u2019 time, the citizens of  our neighbour  to the south-east, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, will have to take a landmark decision about their future \u2014 whether to endorse the unprecedented compromise achieved with neighbouring Greece, which will clear their path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. It is a truly historic moment and shows exactly why we should support the citizens of that country as they take that new decision for their country.\nTwo of our other neighbours face a very difficult dilemma. We support the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, and we welcome their determination to move forward in normalizing bilateral relations with the help of EU mediation. At the same time, we deem the potential re-tailoring of borders a non-viable solution, not just in this case but in general.\nImportant elections for Bosnia and Herzegovina are coming up in October. They will serve as a key test of the country\u2019s unity and determination to progress further along the path of European integration. As we can see, the situation in that part of Europe is very dynamic and fraught with important events that for many years to come will determine the direction of the region\u2019s development and, to a large extent, the state  of the EU. What we have  managed to achieve so  far as a result of our work within the main priorities of Bulgarian foreign policy is part of our contribution to peace and security on the European continent and the world beyond.\nHowever, the generally optimistic prospects for the Western Balkans and South-Eastern Europea are in drastic contrast to the conflicts that surround them on three sides \u2014 in Ukraine to the north-east, in the Middle East to the south-east and in Libya to the south. Migration flows and the increasing threat of terrorism are the direct consequences of conflicts around the world. I will address those topics in due course.\nFirst, I would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. In the past four and a half years, according to data from the United Nations, the total number of victims in the conflict has exceeded 10,000, and the number of wounded stands  at 24,000. There is special cause for concern about the deteriorating humanitarian and environmental situation in Donbas. In addition to such dire statistics,  there has been no real progress in implementing the Minsk agreements, which, in our view, represent the only way to a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict. The existing differences with regard to the deployment of international peacekeeping forces in eastern Ukraine under the auspices of the United Nations continue. We, the leaders of the States Members of this international Organization, share the responsibility to establish a peaceful, fair and sustainable world order that rests on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I call on the Assembly to redouble its efforts to achieve peace and stability in Ukraine without infringing on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nThe situation in Syria remains  tragic.  Despite  the efforts of the international community, military activities in the country continue, resulting in increasing numbers of casualties among the civilian population, as well as thousands of new migrants. As a country that is geographically close to Syria, Bulgaria supports efforts to prevent any further escalation of the military conflict. To that end, we support the continuation of political dialogue and intra-Syria negotiations, with the aim of finding a permanent political solution to  the crisis.\nWe support the launch of international initiatives to create conditions that are conducive to restarting the Middle East peace process through bilateral talks. We believe that that is the way to achieve a final agreement, based on the principle of two States coexisting in peace and stability. That is why we greatly appreciate and strongly support the efforts of Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, to improve the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible.\nWith regard to Libya, Bulgaria supports the United Nations Action Plan for Libya and the efforts  of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, whose primary task is to stabilize the country and reach national conciliation in the context of the existing political and institutional fragmentation. We support\n \nthe agreement reached by the four key political leaders for conducting presidential and parliamentary elections.\nIt is impossible to end all conflicts, but I would nevertheless like to say a few words about another important issue related to peace and security in the world, especially after some of the  statements  we have heard from Mr.  Abbas,  Mr.  Netanyahu  and  Mr. Rouhani. We are of the opinion that in the current context, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on  the Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a key element in the international  security  architecture. We also support all efforts for the full, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace in North- East Asia.\nMigration flows and refugee crises are a global phenomenon, the result of a myriad political and socioeconomic factors, and of conflicts in various parts of the world in particular. Let me underscore clearly and right from the start that irregular migration is a serious challenge to our societies\u2019 security and stability. That is why we need to strengthen cooperation among all the countries concerned, including countries of origin, transit and destination, in order to reach a sustainable and permanent solution. It must fully guarantee human rights and the sovereign right of States to ensure the security of their borders.\nThe efforts of the international community should focus chiefly on the main causes of migration, which are political, socioeconomic and natural \u2014  that  is, the result of natural disasters. We should pay special attention to the various dimensions of development and the integral link between development and security. However, if we do not support those efforts with active mediation and peacekeeping and do not manage to resolve current conflicts and prevent future ones, our chances for success are doomed. That is where I see the crucial and unique role of the United Nations, which can and should be strengthened if there is sufficient political will on the part of Member States.\nDuring its presidency of the Council of the European Union, Bulgaria took an active part in the process of negotiating the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Finalizing the language of the compact is an achievement based on multilateral cooperation, and I am confident that its adoption at  the Intergovernmental Conference in Morocco in December will lay the groundwork for the successful\nimplementation of the first-ever global framework for cooperation in the area of international migration.\nWe in Bulgaria also welcome the completion  of the consultations on the text of the global compact on refugees, which constitutes a comprehensive response to the problem of large-scale migration flows, based on the principle of shared responsibility. We have recently seen an increase in the numbers of terrorist attacks all over  the world, as well  as in the number   of innocent victims of terrorism. Irregular migration waves have enabled the infiltration of our countries and communities by former fighters from Syria,  Iraq, Afghanistan and other places, including trained members of terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaida.\nBulgaria categorically condemns all forms and expressions of terrorism, no matter what cause they claim to support. They undermine peace, security and the social and economic development of States. That  is why an effective response to the problem requires the coordinated efforts of the entire international community. That is also why we support the United Nations in its capacity as a  universal  organization that possesses the full range of instruments to  lead and coordinate the process, along with facilitating the exchange of experience among regional organizations and national agencies and assisting in streamlining their efforts.\nWe support the work of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and the specific steps taken to intensify the Organization\u2019s operations in that regard, including support for the organization of the High-level Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of Member States. One priority is taking measures to protect young people from being radicalized or joining terrorist groups, as well as to neutralize the influence of persons and organizations instigating terrorist attacks.\nThis year we mark the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and for the first time  Bulgaria  will  present its candidacy for membership of the Human Rights Council. We rely on the support of Member States. That is not an end in itself for us but  rather an expression of our consistent policy of working for the protection and affirmation of human rights in Bulgaria and at  the global level. Our presidency of the Council of the European Union also gave  Bulgaria the  opportunity to showcase its contribution to various aspects of the\n \nprotection of human rights. We intend to continue to share our best practices as a member of the Human Rights Council. The values that give meaning to any political effort subsume the past, the present and the future. That is also what allows us to better comprehend and appreciate our present efforts.\nThere is a moment in Bulgaria\u2019s history of which we Bulgarians are justifiably proud. Seventy-five years ago, in some of the darkest years of the Second World War, Bulgaria\u2019s citizens, Church and enlightened leaders and intellectuals stood up to attempts to deport nearly 50,000 Bulgarian Jews to the death camps. They managed to prevent that from happening. Bulgarians achieved that at a time when Nazi Germany had subordinated and occupied almost all of Europe. Bulgaria is proud of the people who managed to save nearly 50,000 Jews.\nI share the story about the saving of Bulgarian Jews because it carries a very strong message that is relevant to the present day and to all who feel threatened. It shows that humaneness and courage can triumph over power and irrationality and save lives. It reminds us that we should never stop fighting for human life and the right causes. The salvation of the Bulgarian Jews is a much-needed example that can reassure us that values are not a forgotten notion but offer a chance for a better future.\nThe Bulgarian example should become more widely known to more people so that it can give courage to others around the world who are fighting to defend their lives and those lives of others and to protect dignity and human rights. It is our mission at present not to allow xenophobia and anti-Semitism to return or to permit a disregard for the right to live based on race, ethnicity or other factors. We Bulgarians know that it is possible and that it has happened before.\nOur main task is to guarantee peace and prosperity around the world. I am convinced that that is attainable, not through arms or battles but rather through a greater sense of humanity and responsibility. We also need more than ever to strengthen the  role  and  authority of the United Nations in its global operations. I am confident that, with effort and good will on  the part of all Member States, that grand goal can be achieved.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to say a few words to Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s and congratulate her on her election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. I assure you, Madam  President,  that you can count on the full cooperation of my country, Guinea-Bissau, in performing your important duties. I would also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his excellent work during his term.\nFurthermore, I would  like to highlight the work of our current Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in particular his innovative leadership  of the Secretariat and the new momentum that he has instilled in the Organization to better face global challenges and strengthen multilateralism. His vision of the Organization\u2019s unifying role in affirming and applying the principles enshrined in the  Charter of  the United Nations and the collective responsibility of every Member State for the establishment of lasting global peace strengthen our conviction that, under his leadership, the United Nations will be better prepared for and more capable of contributing to the advent of a more just and equitable world in the coming years.\nOn 24 September we celebrated the 100th birthday of President Nelson Mandela \u2014 Madiba \u2014 and had the opportunity to reflect on the life and accomplishments of that great humanist (see A/73/PV.5). The late former South African President was an example of courage, abnegation and tolerance. Mandela fought for freedom, justice, democracy and a society in which all people might live together as equals in harmony. That is a great lesson that will continue to serve as a source of inspiration for us and future generations.\nIn his latest report on the work of the Organization (A/73/1), the Secretary-General reminds us that, for many peoples, peace remains a difficult goal to achieve. As our much-missed former Secretary-General, the late Kofi Annan, said, peace is a suspended dream. Many conflicts persist around the world, and many people continue to suffer the destruction brought on by war, Many have been killed, including children. Millions  of people have been forced to abandon  their homes and their cities, leaving behind their families and the possessions they acquired through a lifetime of work, in search of asylum. We cannot remain indifferent to the suffering and despair of the thousands of people, including children, seeking protection and asylum, particularly in Europe.\nThe situation in Palestine, as well as in Yemen and Syria, continues to be a source of great concern for the international community. On the African continent, internal tensions caused by the activities of terrorist groups persist, particularly in the Sahel, spreading fear among populations and preventing their Governments from focusing on development and on creating the best possible living conditions for their citizens.\nClimate change has caused an increasing number of severe droughts and floods in many parts of the world. Many island countries face the risk of disappearing, owing to rising sea levels. Those challenges require greater efforts, new attitudes and increasingly responsible behaviour on the part of all of us. Above all, we must rigorously meet the commitments stipulated in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nI believe that we all have an obligation under the Charter, to which we all subscribe, and that we must respect it regardless of the circumstances, because the principles enshrined therein are the foundation and basis for a rules-based world order. Specifically, the principle of the peaceful resolution of disputes, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and multilateralism are the cornerstone for building international peace and security. We live in a global village in which we all are responsible not only for what happens within our own territories, but, given the interdependence of countries, one country\u2019s national policies may gravely affect many other countries. That requires shared responsibility.  In that regard, I would be remiss if I did not address the issue of Security Council reform, particularly with regard to the increased representation of the African continent, which would enhance the legitimacy of that principal United Nations organ.\n \nI would like to take this opportunity to briefly update the Assembly on the current political situation in Guinea-Bissau, as well as the  results  achieved. Last April, in Lom\u00e9, Togo, within the framework of  an extraordinary summit convened by the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community  of West African States, we reached an important decision aimed at permanently overcoming the political and constitutional impasse that has prevailed in my country for more than three years. As Head of State and in order to build peace and stability in my country and the subregion, I have sought to implement the recommendations that resulted from the summit, namely, the appointment of a consensus Prime Minister and the scheduling of a date for holding legislative elections, namely, 18 November. Those recommendations have been fully implemented, with the following results: the formation of a Government of inclusion in accordance with the Conakry Agreement; the reopening of our National People\u2019s Assembly; the extension of the terms of Assembly members; the election of the members of the National Electoral Commission; and the approval of the Government  programme  and the  general State budget.\nRecent political, social, and economic events bear witness to the fact that the people of Guinea-Bissau, together with our armed forces, said \u201cno\u201d to instability and embarked upon a path of peace and development. The process for the holding of our elections on 18 November is under way, and we began registering voters on\n19 September, despite delays due to technical and financial issues. Please note that, for the first time in the history of our democracy, a legislative session has been completed without any interruptions caused by coups d\u2019\u00e9tat or other incidents. Accordingly, on 30 August, the Security Council noted (see S/PV.8337) the positive developments concerning the political stability in our country. I also note that in the report of the Secretary- General (S/2018/771), as in his previous reports, we were commended on the republican attitudes of the armed forces, which have displayed a notable sense of civic duty in recent years. In the name of justice and national harmony, I take this opportunity to appeal to the international community and to the members of the Security Council, of which sanctions are the exclusive prerogative, to lift the sanctions imposed on officials of our armed forces. That long-anticipated decision would certainly help consolidate our democratic institutions and bring about lasting peace in our country.\nPeace is essential  for  successful  development, but peace is not just the absence of armed conflict. There can be no peace when a large portion, if not the majority, of the population, particularly women and youth, are not sufficiently valued; when their education is considered less important; when their contribution to the economic growth of our country is not recognized or fairly compensated; or when women are not on par with men in positions of influence and are ignored as the pillar of society. We recently took significant steps in my country towards ensuring equal representation for men and women. The Parliament of Guinea-  Bissau adopted a law that guarantees a minimum representation quota of 36 per cent for women in high- profile positions, particularly in the National People\u2019s Assembly and the Government. As President of the Republic and guarantor of  national equity and unity, I am particularly pleased by and grateful for those national advances.\nI would like to conclude my remarks by reaffirming Guinea-Bissau\u2019s commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to the important, unique and irreplaceable role played by the Organization. We must join forces to better manage globalization, eradicate poverty and hunger, and combat major endemic diseases, as well as to ensure education and the provision of potable water for all in order to implement the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Let us stand in solidarity and demonstrate our compassion for those who are fleeing persecution, war and misery, particularly migrants and refugees who are victims of political crises and natural catastrophes and are desperately knocking on our doors. In a solidary and brotherly world, we will be in a better position to build a better future for future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "I extend my greetings to the President of the General Assembly, Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, whom I wish to recognize as the first Latin American woman to serve the United Nations in this capacity.\nI also recognize Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his renewed commitment to the Organization. To the people of Panama, I express once again, from this rostrum, my gratitude for having been given the opportunity to serve them.\nAs I return to the General Assembly for the seventh time, I am drawing to a close my chapter as Head of\n \nState. In just a few months, I  will open a  new one as  a citizen of the world, but one who is determined to continue supporting the efforts of this institution, fighting for peace and social  justice  and  following the example of great leaders like Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan.\nOver these years, I have borne witness to the deliberations and efforts of the United Nations aimed at fostering harmony in the world. Some of the leaders I have listened to in this Hall are no longer with us; some left in peace and others in violent circumstances.\nWe have achieved ambitious goals, from the approval of the Sustainable  Development  Goals  to the commitment to fulfilling them by 2030. Many challenges remain, such as achieving peace in Syria. The theme of the present session spurs us to reflect on the following question: are we as leaders doing enough for the Organization to have a real impact on people\u2019s lives? The answer lies in the commitment of those of us entrusted with the leadership of our countries as we enter the future.\nThe Organization was founded on the conviction that world leaders should be able to forge a path to resolve disputes by peaceful means.  As  we  attend this annual gathering, we bear the responsibility to realize that dream of peace and brotherhood. Peace is threatened not only by weapons but also by injustice, poverty, hunger, inequality and the lack of opportunity experienced by our people. Therefore, as part of our commitment in adopting the Sustainable Development Goals as national policy, our Government has, over the\npast four years, made steady progress towards attaining them. We have rebuilt entire cities, and more than 100,000 Panamanian families will have new homes so that their children may lead a life of dignity.\nThrough a massive health census, we have identified the principal diseases affecting our citizens, allowing us to provide preventive health treatment.\nWe are transforming the Panamanian education system, making it bilingual and more equitable. More than 6,000 Panamanian teachers have been trained abroad to teach English and more than 3,000 new classrooms are being built for our students. Moreover, we have strengthened the system of higher technical education. I am very proud to share with the Assembly the fact that, as we speak, a team of Panamanian instructors is teaching English to Syrian refugee children in the Za\u2019atari camp in Jordan.\nThanks to record investments, we are providing modern sanitation systems to  several cities  across the country and building new water-treatment plants to markedly expand access to drinking water.  We  lead Latin America in terms of investment in urban mobility, with 2,000 kilometres of new roads, and 22 kilometres of metro about to become operational and construction beginning on a further 26 kilometres. We have cut insecurity by 50 per cent, rescued thousands of young people from criminal gangs, and strengthened the capacities of law enforcement.\nToday\u2019s Panama is very different from  the country whose leadership I assumed in 2014. Before all Panamanians and the entire world,  today  I  can say with my head held high that we  have  succeeded  in transforming politics into public service and in rebuilding our democracy to be one that works for future generations. I have governed my country in peace, using dialogue and consensus, invoking the power of the State only to protect the people, not to thwart them. I have held true to the words I spoke on my first day in office by fighting corruption head on and ensuring that no one is above the law.\nMany challenges remain ahead. The judicial system still faces significant challenges to ensure that there is no impunity. We have worked tirelessly to strengthen our institutions and consolidate our young democracy, respecting and supporting the elected authorities from all political parties and their communities, and boosting their economic capacities.\n \nNext year, Panama will hold its seventh democratic elections, with an electoral body that has proven an effective guarantor of transparent democracy. Thanks to the far-reaching electoral reforms that we have pursued, the forthcoming campaign will be the fairest, shortest and most transparent in our history. For the first time, all responsibility for the financing of media campaigns will lie with the State.\nWe continue to strengthen our status as a connected country, with excellent aviation links,  strengthened by a new airport; maritime  connectivity,  enhanced by the expanded Canal and new ports; and human connectivity, whereby our geographical position and facilities such as a new convention centre and cruise port will play an important role. We have a logistics and financial platform at the service of global trade, and we defend and protect it so as to ensure that it is not used for illicit activities. We have seen the successful expansion of the Canal, which reflects the principles of our country: our ability to unite the world, our permanent neutrality and our openness to global trade. This interoceanic link was restored to the people of Panama thanks to the Panama Canal treaties and the courageous decision of a simple human being, former President of the United States Jimmy Carter, whose commitment, I publicly acknowledge today, changed the course of our nation\u2019s history.\nWhile we have experienced difficult situations that have affected our national image, we have been able to move on based on the principle that justice becomes unjust when it ceases to protect the innocent. We have demonstrated to the world that our country and its economy have succeeded thanks solely to the honest work of our people. Through our efforts in recent years to attain the Sustainable Development Goals, we have lifted more than 150,000 Panamanians out of poverty, which means a reduction of 5 percentage points, from 25 to 20 per cent, and maintained average annual economic growth of 5 per cent. We are strengthening the social protection system for the elderly and students. We have made major improvements to hospital infrastructure, education, school attendance, access to drinking water, education and housing.\nWe have also extended a dignified welcome  to tens of thousands of citizens from other countries who have come to our land seeking a better future for their families. We witnessed the migratory crisis whereby more than 100,000 Haitians left for Brazil following the big earthquake in January 2010. Once in Brazil,\nthey were forced to migrate yet again as a result of the economic crisis there. Many lives were lost along the way. I recognize the leadership displayed by Chile in solving this human tragedy by opening its doors.\nI see the tragedy of migration in the face of Juan, a 7-year-old African boy who now lives alone in Panama because he lost his mother as they walked across the mountains between Panama and Colombia. That child forged in the depths of my heart a commitment that countries must better manage migratory flows, in a more organized manner, while respecting the  rights of all human beings to seek better living conditions. Thousands of migrants from other continents cross our border with Colombia through the dangerous Dari\u00e9n jungle, risking their lives in the hope of realizing their dreams. The lessons learned from these migratory crises compel us to call vigorously once again on the Government of Venezuela to restore political dialogue and a peaceful society based on democracy, so as to avoid further mass migration and the humanitarian crisis of Venezuelans seeking to meet their basic needs.\nSuch migratory flows can be stemmed only by eliminating the reasons for which citizens leave their countries, risking their safety and that of their families. That represents a significant challenge for the United Nations. We actively participated in the development of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, to be adopted under the auspices of the United Nations this year, with the aim of contributing, based on our experience, to the global framework for tackling such crises. Our countries bear a responsibility to develop policies to manage migratory flows in an orderly manner with respect for human dignity. In the coming days, Panama will announce humanitarian measures to support the Venezuelan families residing in our country.\nPanama is a great melting pot, comprising citizens from the world over who came and made a new home in our beautiful land. We have learned to live in peace, respecting all religious beliefs, political ideologies  and philosophies. In this age of communication and social networks, there is no room for discrimination  of any kind. We are all  citizens of  this planet.  This  is our home. Reported violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the brotherly people of Nicaragua risk triggering yet another migratory flow in Central America. I call once again on Nicaragua\u2019s Government and civil-society actors to restore peace through political dialogue.\n \nIn 2015, Panama served as host for the historic rapprochement between Cuba and the United States. I take this opportunity to reiterate the call for a return to that path and for recognition of the steps taken by the Government of Cuba to open its economy for the benefit the Cuban people and the island\u2019s economic and social development.\nI wish to stress that, although our continent is at peace, the political crisis in Venezuela, rising drug production in Colombia, the corruption affecting so many economies in the region and the tense situation in Nicaragua are challenges calling for the region\u2019s political leaders to redouble their efforts to seek compromises to restore peace to those societies.\nIn the fight against drug trafficking, Panama will refocus its strategy to go beyond drug interdiction and criminal arrests to rebuild communities and support people in cutting ties with illegal groups and living as loyal citizens of the State.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to be among the leading nations that work together with multilateral organizations for a better world. In that regard, in November we will inaugurate, in the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Central America and the Caribbean, the Regional Logistics Centre for Humanitarian Assistance. Panama is putting its connectivity at the service of the region to respond to natural disasters and emergencies across the continent.\nWhile respecting different systems of government, I believe that politics in future will be not only about how to obtain power but also how to use it for the good of  the people. Based on  our firm belief  in the need  to build a fairer and more peaceful world, Panama is working to broaden its bilateral relations with countries of South-East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and with Australia and China, as a means of getting closer to the world and of fulfilling our role as a builder of bridges.\nOver the past 10 years, I have had opportunities  to visit more than 40 countries and become acquainted at first hand with best practices, technology and cooperation  programmes,  which  we  have   been  able to use in my country. Such is the nature of diplomacy \u2014 using our abilities to help, and not destroy, one another. Accordingly, we are developing a monorail with Japanese technology, a subway with French trains, technical higher education based on the Singaporean model and electric power plants fuelled by natural\ngas with North American technology. In pursuing our vocation to be a bridge linking the world, Panama will host World Youth Day in January 2019, to be attended by Pope Francis, which will bring together hundreds of thousands of young people from 192 countries and will be focused on the shared goal of achieving peace to build a better world and overcome cultural and religious barriers.\nI bid farewell to the General Assembly with a peaceful conscience, knowing that I have used the political power bestowed upon me by the people solely for their benefit, while unwaveringly leading the struggle. Panama\u2019s success benefits not only Panama\u2019s people, but everyone. I wish to express today before the entire General Assembly and the world my commitment to continue working as a responsible citizen of the world, together with my people and all nations, to strengthen the United Nations system and all its bodies so that the citizens of our beautiful planet always remain the focus of our struggles and efforts.\nIn conclusion, I share with members the pride that I feel in having contributed to strengthening my country\u2019s vocation as a bridge of peace, dialogue and social justice.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring greetings from the people  of  the  Eastern  Republic of Uruguay, a country in the Southern cone of the Americas that is small but nonetheless has strong democratic institutions, social and economic stability and clearly defined values and principles, and that is making tangible progress in all  areas. Of  course, it   is not and never will be perfect \u2014 do such countries exist? \u2014 but it works humbly day after day to make progress while leaving none of its inhabitants behind. That is the meaning of development, a multidimensional and dynamic process aimed at achieving the well-being and prosperity of all citizens. In the World Economic Forum\u2019s Inclusive Development Index 2018, published in January, Uruguay is ranked as one of the 10 most inclusive emerging countries in the world and second in Latin America, owing to efficient public policies that enable us to use economic growth to reduce inequalities and promote social inclusion and equity among generations.\nDespite that, we admit that we still have a lot to do. In that regard, there is a specific issue affecting several countries, including our own, that I would like to briefly discuss. In our view, the criteria  and  methodology that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development applies to assess countries\u2019 development according to their per capita income represents a grave injustice. As a result, Uruguay, like other countries in the region, has been considered a high-income country since 2013, and starting this year, no longer qualifies for official development assistance. The recognition of our progress is encouraging, but we do not agree with the new classification for a fundamental reason, which is that while growth and development are linked, they are clearly not the same thing. Uruguay has enjoyed significant economic growth over the past 15 years that has enabled thousands of its citizens to emerge from poverty. But structural gaps persist.\nDevelopment in transition is not an arbitrary concept. It is the most accurate description of the situation of countries that, like Uruguay, are on a path to development but still need the support of reconsidered and reoriented cooperation. There is no question that we have made progress, but the road  ahead will still be difficult. Paradoxically, it seems that no good deed goes unpunished, and we hope that this criterion will be reviewed soon. In addition, we are also of the view that in the life of countries not everything is about economic development and the  distribution  of  resources.  We in Uruguay know that and have advocated nationally and internationally for an agenda oriented towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, approved by the Assembly in the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Such an agenda should put special emphasis on the transformation of the energy matrix towards renewable sources and adaptation to verifiable climate change; on making progress in the irrefutible responsibility to protect our environment; and, as members are aware, on the fight for the health of our people, which is the struggle for\n \nlife, the main human right that all the beings on this planet have.\nAs a result, we have implemented strict policies for the control of tobacco consumption and the prevention of non-communicable diseases, one of humankind\u2019s worst afflictions, in addition to active participation    at the international level. That includes  co-chairing the World Health Organization Independent High- level Commission on Noncommunicable Diseases and hosting the Global Conference on Non-Communicable Diseases in October 2017, where the Montevideo Road Map 2018-2030 was approved, wherein we reaffirmed the commitment to undertake bold actions to reduce by one third the number of premature deaths from such diseases. There is much left for us to do.  There  is also much to be done to combat the mortal agent that is tobacco, which kills more  than 7  million  of the planet\u2019s inhabitants per year, much more than the number killed by the two world wars of the twentieth century. That is why we invite every country to apply the measures established in Montevideo by the World Health Organization.\nThose and other elements \u2014 such as the universal digital agenda, for which we we have developed our Ceibal and Ibirapit\u00e1 plans, which we do not have the time to go into further detail about here \u2014 give an account of a small, modest and self-confident country moving in a concrete direction. That direction could be described simply as improving the quality of life of all the country\u2019s inhabitants without discrimination of any kind.\nUruguay also belongs to the region and the world. In that vein, we reaffirm our historic commitment to  a more participatory, fairer, balanced and multipolar international system that translates into the basic principles of  our  foreign policy  that  has  existed  for decades. That includes, for example, first, the commitment to the maintenance of peace, international disarmament and security, as well as the participation of our armed forces in peacekeeping operations; second, our country\u2019s firm rejection of terrorism, organized crime and all types of violence and discrimination, which unfortunately are rampant in the world; third, support for the peaceful settlement of disputes  and  for the sovereign equality of States regardless of their geographical size and number of inhabitants; fourth, unimpeded dedication to, and respect for, international law, which is the greatest guarantee for the sovereignty of peoples and their peaceful coexistence; fifth, our\nunwavering commitment to the promotion and the protection of all human rights; sixth, adherence to relevant notions such as non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, respect  for  sovereignty  and the self-determination of peoples; and, seventh, the promotion of multilateralism in all its facets, political, economic, cultural, et cetera, as the best way to face the global challenges facing humankind.\nIn a turbulent international context where the world resembles an asylum run by its own patients, we assert more than ever the values and principles I just mentioned. In that context, we call for a joint, committed effort to strengthen and modernize the international system and the United Nations. Those are not just words. In practice we worked intensely as non-permanent members of the Security Council during the 2016-2017 biennium, and now we are doing the same in the Economic and Social Council. We put forward our country\u2019s candidature as a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021. Uruguay is committed to pacifist ideals, solidarity and global peace and security.\nFrom this place, where we can speak about any number of issues of interest to humankind, I wish to conclude my intervention by mentioning one that, humbly, we consider it a priority to address before everyone here. I am speaking of environmental degradation and the consequences of climate change. The crisis that we are experiencing at the global level must be handled decisively by the leaders of each of the nations represented here. This is everyone\u2019s fight. It is the struggle for life. We ask the powerful world leaders to respect international agreements to protect the environment and to try to avoid ills that are suffered essentially by the world\u2019s poorest people. We have to take active measures to protect all people in our world, especially the poorest, who suffer the most. The world is also suffering, just as a living being suffers, from various risk factors that destroy it little by little, day after day. This world is our only home for now and for future generations. This world suffers from wars, from the unbridled desire for indiscriminate profit by industries that kill humankind, as the tobacco industry does, which have no regard for the environment, pollution or the consequences of the savage consumerism that we are experiencing.\nJust as our behaviour directly affects our health, and it is the duty of the States to fight for the lives of their inhabitants, it is the duty of all of us who inhabit this planet to fight for the place in which we live and\n \nthat we will have to leave for  those who  will follow  us in this life. That is the case of the December 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, concluded within the framework of the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As it is the best possible hope for global survival and security, as well as a commitment that is essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda, we reaffim our commitment to that Agreement. We once again urge the powerful leaders of the countries of the world to respect and comply with those Agreements. Agreements are signed in order to be carried out \u2014 and this one especially must be complied with. We also join the call to all those States that have not yet ratified it to do so as soon as possible. On that issue, as in so many other areas of life, we need not rush; however, we must not be late either. Humankind does not have much time to consider those agreements, which are necessary to protect the environment.\nIn conclusion, we are convinced that the United Nations system is humankind\u2019s best possible opportunity to approach confidently and optimistically the problems that the present and the future pose, and to act accordingly. We are all necessary to this shared task. Member States can count on us, and we know that we can count on all Member States.\n"

        "file_text": "It is  an honour  to deliver this statement on behalf of my President,  His Excellency Mr. Desir\u00e9 Delano Bouterse. My country sincerely applauds the election of Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s as the first woman of the Latin American and Caribbean region to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. In the course of this session, the membership stands to gain greatly from her outstanding personal qualities and wealth of experience as a professional diplomat at the helm of our General Assembly. Suriname pledges its unwavering support for her efforts to make our Organization relevant again for the entire global community, in particular the disadvantaged and the marginalized, including women and young people.\nAs we remember the legacy of the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, we honour his tireless efforts to make the world more peaceful and humane by fighting against inequality and injustice, combating diseases and resolving conflicts with all of the means at\n \nour disposal, while making the United Nations the focal point of multilateralism.\nAs honoured as I am to address this gathering  that brings together so many world  leaders,  I  am also disheartened by the sombre tone expressed by Secretary-General Guterres in the presentation of his annual report on the work of our Organization (A/73/1). As the Secretary-General noted, thetargets set last year have not been met. We have to ask ourselves if we will make the same appeals this year, with the same attitude of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with regard to outcomes, whether or not they will be effective.\nSuriname concurs with the assessment of the Secretary-General that the fundamental issue confronting the international community today is the lack of trust among nations. In that regard, as a small nation, my country firmly commits to upholding internationally accepted principles that clearly define who we are and provide for predictable actions in our international relations, thereby creating a climate of trust, understanding and respect. We underscore the need for a rules-based world order with the United Nations at the centre. That is required in order to create the necessary platform to address global concerns, including the mobilization of funds to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nBeing a low-lying coastal State, Suriname is among the most threatened countries directly impacted by sea- level rise. Approximately 80 per cent of our population resides in coastal areas, and our main production activities are also concentrated in that area, resulting in an existential threat. As we have witnessed in recent days, the forces of nature have struck once again \u2014 not only in our sister Caribbean nations but also elsewhere in the world. We are being urged to move beyond rhetoric and to take immediate action.\nMy country is strategically located on the Guiana Shield. My country has an abundance of natural resources, unique biodiversity and an impressive forest cover of more than  90  per  cent.  Moreover,  our population, including indigenous peoples, tribal communities of African descent and various other ethnic groups, descends from all the continents of the world. All express and enjoy exceptional tolerance, religious freedom and respect for one another\u2019s cultures and backgrounds and are equally entitled in terms of access to social programmes, including health care and education. We have used that diversity, inherited from\nour colonial past, to our advantage by rejecting the divide-and-rule of yesteryear. We are indeed proud that our people, coming from various ethnic and religious backgrounds, can live in peace and harmony with one another, forging bonds conducive to nation-building and working towards the well-being of all citizens \u2014 both young and old.\nWith regard to our economic challenges and policy measures, my country, as a commodity-based export economy, is highly vulnerable to commodity- price shocks. The sharp downturn in gold and oil prices three years ago and the closure of the century- old bauxite operation in 2016 have led to a sharp recession and a severe loss of Government revenue. The economy contracted by a combined 8 per cent, while the Government lost more than a third of its fiscal revenue in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). That required unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy adjustments in order to stabilize the exchange rate, reduce domestic demand and re-establish a viable balance of payments position. Our monetary authorities moved to a flexible exchange-rate regime and sharply curtailed credit creation in the country. Since October 2016, the exchange rate has been stabilized, monthly inflation rates have fallen to less  than  1  per  cent, and there is no longer a current account deficit in the balance of payments.\nThe fiscal responses, usually a more difficult undertaking, began early in August 2015 with a massive contraction in Government expenditure and increases in taxation. While the crisis continued to erode revenue in terms of GDP, expenditure was cut from more than 30 per cent of GDP in 2015 to less than 23 per cent in 2017. As a result, the unsustainable deficit of 10 per cent of GDP that emerged during the crisis years has already been reduced to an estimated 5 per cent of GDP in 2018. Looking ahead, the Government also put in place significant reforms to limit the impact of future export-commodity shocks. Institutional reforms will help to promote foreign direct investment aimed at diversifying our economy, moving it away from its heavy reliance on extractive industries. Fiscal reforms aimed at reducing reliance on direct tax income and broadening the tax base are at the top of our priorities. The establishment of a sovereign wealth fund will stabilize income derived from the extractive industries and help to mitigate the fiscal impact of future shocks. The International Monetary Fund and international rating agencies have commended those efforts and\n \npredict a continued improvement in the macroeconomic\nperformance of Suriname.\nOur efforts have indeed borne fruit, and the Government is committed to continuing fiscal policies aimed at restoring the primary fiscal surplus. Those efforts to steer us on the right path towards development are hampered by  obstacles that  are  unjustifiable  and not of our making. First of all, I would like to mention the matter of Suriname\u2019s classification as a middle-income country \u2014 an issue to which I alluded from this very rostrum last year (see A/72/PV.21) but which remains unresolved. Our classification, like that of many other developing countries, including those in the Caribbean, is based on GDP per capita, which does not reflect our vulnerabilities. We strongly reject that unrealistic classification, which disregards various factors and creates  great  challenges  for  us. It is a matter that should be addressed with urgency. Access to concessional financing for our development is critical to the implementation of programmes that benefit all our citizens. Correspondent banking and de-risking, further aggravated by unilateral actions, including blacklisting and the arbitrary seizure of funds, without due regard for the severe consequences to the community, including businessmen and families, remain obstacles over which we have no influence. An atmosphere of trust and political will is crucial and should lead to dialogue and cooperation in order to address all matters of concern.\nAlthough Suriname contributes significantly to the mitigation of the effects of climate change through its high level of forest cover and low  deforestation rate, regrettably, we must acknowledge that global commitments, based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, have yet to materialize in the form of tangible results. Suriname is one of 11 countries with a high level of forest cover and a low deforestation rate, representing 20 per cent of the Earth\u2019s remaining tropical forests and storing 18 per cent of tropical forest carbon. Yet we are not able to fully benefit from global arrangements associated with sound forest management. At the twenty-third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change last year, Suriname pledged to maintain its forest coverage at  93 per cent. We also made the conditional commitment to sustain our leadership position as one of the most carbon-negative countries. That pledge, subject to scientific, technological, technical and financial\nsupport, extends beyond national benefits into the realm of global gains for humankind. It is against the backdrop of that reality that Suriname will host a high- level conference on climate finance mobilization in February 2019. The conference will seek to initiate and implement new economic models of ecosustainability aimed at improving the quality of life for all.\nThe scourges of illicit drug trafficking, transnational organized crime and terrorism, as well as trafficking in arms and persons, place an unprecedented burden on the financial and human-resource capacity of small developing countries, hampering their ability to implement policy measures aimed at achieving development objectives. Drug abuse and drug trafficking destroy families, disrupt communities and rob our youth of a productive future. Our open borders compel us to strengthen cooperation with adjacent, neighbouring and other countries in order to effectively combat transnational organized crime and its negative consequences. Such cooperation must yield results, and we will join others in the fight against the world drug problem. We need more than lip service today. We need to join one another in taking action. Likewise, we solicit international cooperation to protect our unique biodiversity, which is under threat, owing to illegal poaching and trade in endangered species.\nWith regard to our collaboration at the bilateral, subregional and multilateral levels, Suriname continues to stand for international peace and security. We advocate for dialogue in the resolution of any existing conflict and uphold the  internationally  accepted  principles  of  non-interference,  non-intervention  and  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. Suriname respects and protects all human rights. However, we strongly reject using human rights for political gains. All conflicts that arise are a consequence of departing from those valued principles. That is why  I  would like to reiterate that those valued principles form the bedrock of Suriname\u2019s foreign policy. In the same vein, my country applauds those who have chosen the path of dialogue to resolve their disputes. In that regard, allow me to mention the rapprochement between countries in the Horn of Africa and on the Korean peninsula.\nOur geographic location positions us as a strategic hub. As such, Suriname has strengthened its bonds with neighbouring and adjacent countries and with those with whom we enjoy remarkable historic ties. As we strengthen partnerships based on mutual respect and benefit, we seek to advance our national development\n \nobjectives with a focus on agriculture and tourism through foreign direct investments, South-South cooperation and regional partnerships. Suriname, with its human capital as its greatest asset and an abundance of natural resources, such as fresh water, oil, gold, bauxite and other minerals, maintains warm and friendly relations with many countries. We focus on reinforcing existing partnerships and initiating new ones. As a result, many friends from all corners of the world are seeking to forge durable partnerships, based on mutual respect and benefit.\nThe Latin American and Caribbean region  has not been spared from tensions resulting from existing differences of opinion on various issues. The 2014 Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace has certainly contributed to ensuring that there is no room for military adventures. We strongly appeal for dialogue where there are differences. We must prevent outside forces from imposing their agenda on us, which run counter to our own interests as a region. Let us focus on what binds us and not on what divides us. It is reprehensible that some economically powerful countries resort to applying unilateral sanctions when they encounter ideological and political differences. Such economic warfare does not augur well for solving disputes. On the contrary, positions are hardened with far-reaching consequences for regional and international stability, peace and security. Suriname strongly rejects such coercive economic and trade measures, as they are  counterproductive and create an atmosphere of distrust, rendering the peaceful resolution of disputes practically impossible. In that regard, we disapprove of the continuation of the economic, financial and commercial embargo against Cuba and its people. Time and again, the majority of nations has taken a stand against that embargo. Is it not now time to honour the demand of the majority of the international community and end the blockade?\nThe current arms race is deplorable and consumes tremendous amounts of resources. Imagine what we could have achieved in terms of making the world more humane if those resources had been channelled into combating disease and hunger and improving food safety and security. Who would not aspire to those sustainable goals? Like many other countries, Suriname calls for an end to the arms race, while also rejecting the militarization of outer space and research in the area of artificial intelligence for warfare purposes.\nMultilateralism remains essential for undertaking joint actions aimed at achieving sustainable development and addressing matters of global concern, such as maintaining peace and security, combating terrorism and transnational organized crime and  addressing the issue of climate change. Suriname supports those initiatives, as we seek to reinforce the validity of multilateralism based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nWe are convinced that the United Nations remains the most important body for discussing all matters concerning the international community, with the aim of finding solutions and taking into consideration the interests of Member States. It is therefore essential to make this institution more relevant by making it more democratic, transparent and accountable. Continued efforts to reform the  United  Nations  remain crucial if we wish to reflect the realities of  today\u2019s  world.  For example, the process to reform the Security Council must be comprehensive, inclusive, balanced and consensus-based, while taking into account the interests of both developed and developing countries and further promoting, preserving and strengthening international peace and security.\nThe President\u2019s priorities for the seventy-third session have been noted, and Suriname is fully supportive, as we work together to make the Organization relevant once again. We have to ensure that our youth is engaged and participates in a structured manner in the affairs of this world body, recognizing the fact that they are unique and innovative in their own way. As lead head in the Caribbean Community for youth development, Suriname wholeheartedly supports the views expressed earlier in the debate advocating for the creation of a United Nations agency dealing with youth. I expect that the recently launched United Nations Youth Strategy will be inclusive and deliver on the aspirations of the world\u2019s young people.\nIn the final analysis, when Suriname speaks, we speak to give strength to the voices of all nations, whether small or big, developed or developing. We must globally recommit to the principle of dialogue and the cause of lasting peace. That recommitment, which I call on all of us to embrace, is the inherent right to a decent life and protection for all who are born on this planet. Through our Organization, we have at our disposal all the means needed to take on that responsibility. We have no one but ourselves do that for us.\n \nLet me conclude by saying  that,  if  there  were  no United Nations, today we would be calling for its creation. Therefore, as I said before, let us decide to focus on what binds us rather than on what divides us.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to start by extending my congratulations to Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s and wishing much success to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. Let me also assure her that, by working with Member States and the United Nations family, we look forward to advancing the seven priorities set out in the agenda of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to provide the General Assembly with the latest regarding the situation in Afghanistan and the gains, opportunities and challenges that my nation faces at this critical juncture, in addition to our views on other key global challenges.\nThe record of accomplishments by this institution over the past 73  years  demonstrates  that,  wherever it might be and whoever it might impact, we cannot escape the ripple effect of, or de-link ourselves from, the global, national, communal and human connections that bind  us, whether  in relation  to  the environment,\n \nthe climate, international finance or even the cyber and technology arenas. It is therefore critically important to go beyond just words, the duplication of effort or ineffective models that intermingle and, at times, spur countervailing or lopsided interests.\nAs Albert Einstein once said, \u201cWe cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them\u201d. Whether we are addressing hunger, acute poverty, climate change, overpopulation, terrorism, conflict, displacement, inequality or organized crime, we all share and own bits and pieces of  the problem in the same way that we collectively benefit or learn from the solutions. As a result, we need to explore  new means and identify new tools for reaching a wider consensus through more thoughtful dialogue and results-oriented actions.\nTo this day we do not have a globally and officially acceptable definition for terrorism, a nefarious phenomenon used by a rogue or politically connected criminal, State or non-State actor using religious, ideological, economic or psychological cover to disrupt the status quo, upend the global and nation State order and reach a particular set of radical goals through the sheer use of indiscriminate violence that no religion in its undistorted form condones.\nWhile we are determined to fight with vigour against newer versions of terror presenting themselves as remnants of Da\u2019esh in a few pockets inside Afghanistan, we are still struggling to fully comprehend the role that terror breeding grounds, sanctuaries and funding pools, in many cases tied to criminal and illicit drug networks, play in the use and spread of terrorism. We are still trying to figure out how to render terrorism impotent as a policy tool used by some to further specific agendas.\nFor example, for almost a quarter of a century, Afghanistan experienced the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives and major infrastructural damage. It is partly due to geography and partly due to shortsighted strategies and regional agendas that have generated an umbilical reliance on non-State actors, used to keep others unstable through violence and  the  promotion of extremism. It has resulted in complacency and impunity; therefore, we need to do more and go beyond ineffective norms to bring about change and accountability. We have asked our neighbouring States, especially Pakistan, to help targeted societies, including their own, to deal with this menace. We are looking forward to the timely and effective implementation of\nthe recently agreed Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity.\nAll stakeholders need to agree to treat all shades of terrorism as one, shut down the breeding grounds and sanctuaries and prosecute or repatriate the violators. The response thus far has been sparse and insufficient. We are working with all countries, near and far, to bring about better results. On that basis, Afghanistan stands for the balanced implementation of all four pillars of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and non-compliance must be seriously addressed as well. My country has also begun a process of structured cooperation with the United Nations Office of Counter- Terrorism, and we are supportive of regional initiatives through forums that focus on such priority concerns. We will continue to engage in work with regional stakeholders in that regard.\nSince we last met, Afghanistan turned a page and made unprecedented overtures to the Taliban to be part of a credible, Afghan-owned, Afghan-led peace process that could lead to a just and comprehensive political settlement through talks and reconciliation. On several occasions, we have pledged our commitment to unconditional intra-Afghan dialogue and the restoration of all rights and privileges for those who agree to end the cycle of violence. We even announced a unilateral ceasefire earlier this year, which was agreed to by the Taliban for a three-day period and gave Afghans a glimpse of what peace can look and feel like. Unfortunately, extraneous agendas prevented us from replicating a second ceasefire more recently, but we will not rest. We will have to pursue both what is right and attainable.\nI want to express my sincere thanks to all nations, especially the United States, other concerned nations and parties \u2014 including the Governments of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and of Indonesia, both of which recently hosted United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) gatherings \u2014 the United Nations and others for  encouraging all  sides to set the stage for a process that would lead to talks and a just and comprehensive negotiated settlement. Looking at the 25-year record, a prerequisite for talks is to learn from the history of peace engagement. We see that a dual approach is necessary to make sure that we win peace, but also protect and preserve our people\u2019s gains and hard-earned achievements, which include constitutional order, freedom of expression, human and gender rights and creating economic opportunities.\n \nI want to pause here and pay tribute to Afghans who continue to suffer as a result of violence, as well as to our valiant National Security Forces for their steadfast defence of our nation and for standing tall and strong on the front line against terrorism.\nThere are two important popular tests on the horizon  for  Afghanistan:  parliamentary  elections are slated for  next month and presidential elections for next year. Drawing on past experiences, both President Ashraf Ghani and I agree that political legitimacy is derived from the will of the people. While we pursue peace efforts and deal with security and governance challenges, we are reminded that, given our circumstances, eventually we must make sure that the electoral process is trustworthy and that the electorate can agree to a fairly credible and legitimate outcome. Regardless of who wins or loses, Afghanistan\u2019s future rests on nurturing a national consensus that provides unity of purpose aimed at peace and political stability that derives legitimacy from foundations that are pluralistic, inclusive and democratic.\nIn that regard, I wish to  thank  the  United Nations \u2014 UNAMA in particular \u2014 the European Union and all other contributors and donors for helping us move the process forward. Furthermore, we look forward to the upcoming Geneva ministerial conference on Afghanistan in November. It will be an excellent occasion to evaluate our work and the path ahead since we last met with donors.\nOn the humanitarian front, Afghanistan also faces daunting tasks associated with an impending drought, refugee resettlement and internal displacement caused by climatic and national abnormalities, food insecurity and security threats. Those are estimated to impact two thirds of the country and the livelihoods of more than 4 million people, with the potential to force 1 million more into migration. We sorely need to attend to their humanitarian needs. I want to thank the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, other United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations and donors for their contributions and hard work on the ground; however, we urge the international community to fully fund the 2018-2021 Afghanistan humanitarian response plan.\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes and the protection of oppressed people are core principles of the Charter of the United Nations, benefiting the promotion\nand preservation of international peace and security. As a war-ravaged country, we sympathize with and feel for the people of Syria, Yemen and other victimized communities around the world. Likewise, we stand for the basic right to protection for the Rohingya population in Myanmar. Afghanistan stands in  full support  of all United Nations and other international efforts aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the question of Palestine, including the General Assembly\u2019s call for an international protection mechanism for civilians.\nMoreover, United Nations peacebuilding activities should provide due focus on the principle of national ownership, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the promotion of greater coherence among the relevant United Nations entities and agencies working on development.\nWith regard to the reform agenda, we stand in full support of efforts aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations in the context of the Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives. The establishment of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs is a welcome move, as is the setting up of the Office of Counter- Terrorism. We look  forward  to  the  implementation of the resolution adopted on the repositioning of the United Nations development system and believe it will enhance our achievements in the establishment of One UN for Afghanistan.\nAfghanistan\u2019s active role within the United Nations system is currently more pronounced than ever. Our chairmanship of the Third Committee during the seventy- third session comes at a crucial time, as we have aimed to initiate and adopt several draft resolutions on shared themes, including victims of terrorism and the threat of improvised explosive devices, in addition to refugee and migrant issues, the rights of children, women\u2019s empowerment, human rights, social development and other relevant Committee agenda items.\nFurthermore, Afghanistan\u2019s election to the Human Rights Council for the first time in 2017 marked our commitment and showcased our achievements in that regard. We remain party to major international protocols and conventions on human rights. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Afghanistan recently passed a set of national laws on prohibiting cruel and degrading treatment, endorsed the law on prohibiting torture and combating human and migrant trafficking and adopted a code prohibiting child recruitment into our security\n \nforces. With regard to the latter, we are working closely with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.\nI want to leave this rostrum by presenting a bold concept, also recently mentioned by President Ghani, that can form a new, visionary paradigm for my country and our region as we strive to end four decades of conflict and enter a new phase free of violence and the forced implementation of  stagnant ideas and spoiler habits. It is a  concept that dwells  on  Afghanistan becoming a platform of cordiality for regional and hemispheric cooperation over the next few years, in sharp contrast to being pushed and pulled towards becoming an area of instability and confrontation.\nOur people, who pose no danger to anyone, are demanding a fundamental change in which they can play a constructive and collaborative role across boundaries and help turn their country into a roundabout of people, goods, services, communications, cooperation and ideas across the wider region. I believe that, with the help of the international community, we can turn this concept into a reality. I hope to further engage our regional partners in helping us bring this vision to fruition. I hope that the Assembly and all concerned Member States will play a supportive and positive role to put an end to years of agony and open up a new path leading to durable peace, stability and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by congratulating Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session and to wish her success in fulfilling her important mandate. Furthermore, I would like to thank Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for the fruitful actions he carried out in his capacity as President of the General Assembly during the previous session and to wish him success in his future endeavours.\nI take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a true leader and promoter of United Nations values, who will remain in the memory of the Organization as one of the most distinguished and dedicated supporters of humanitarianism and global peace.\nFor more than 70 years, the United Nations has been at the centre of multilateral diplomacy,  playing  a primary role in global processes from international peace and security to the promotion of human rights and sustainable development. While the international environment continues to evolve, now is a crucial moment in which the United Nations must adapt itself in order to meet the challenges of the modern world. Hence we welcome the initiatives of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, which he has been carrying out since his first day in office. In particular, we welcome the reform aimed at enhancing the performance of\n \nthe Secretariat in the  area  of  international  peace and security by focusing on conflict prevention as a top priority. Furthermore, we support the efforts to reform United Nations management by streamlining functions and increasing the accountability of all of the branches of the Secretariat in the fulfilment of their mandate. Finally, the recent decision to reposition the United Nations development system by enabling it to effectively contribute to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, which were agreed three years ago, is particularly important.\nUndoubtedly, those initiatives are very complex and will bring systemic changes across the entire Organization. In order to ensure that those reforms yield the expected results in the medium and long terms, transparent and constructive dialogue among United Nations management and States Members of the Organization must continue.\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will definitely be a milestone in the work of the Organization for years to come. The reform of the United Nations development system comes at a time when the implementation of that Agenda must be accelerated at all levels in a joint effort of the United Nations system and Member States.\nWe welcome the new reform vision by which the private sector will be more actively involved in the achievement of sustainable development at the global, regional and national levels. That partnership has the potential to provide a new impetus for progress and innovation, including for financial mobilization aimed at filling the funding gaps that the Organization is currently facing.\nBearing in mind the Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Government of the Republic of Moldova has developed, through an inclusive and participatory process, a vision of a new development strategy called Moldova 2030, which is fully aligned with its international commitments, including the Moldova-European Union Association Agreement. That new development strategy highlights the well-being and human rights of our citizens and the protection of the environment, as well as cultivating an inclusive society, as its top priorities.\nThere are several ongoing projects aimed at realizing those objectives. We are currently implementing an ambitious national programme to rehabilitate the road infrastructure across the country in order to improve\nthe connectivity and mobility of people, goods and services. We are introducing greater innovation and technology in public services for greater accessibility, better quality and transparency and in order to eliminate corruption.\nWe have taken an important step forward towards the integration of the Republic of Moldova into the European energy market by signing an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the financing  of  the  largest  energy  project  in the Republic of Moldova  since  its  independence.  The country\u2019s energy independence is crucial to its sustainable development and social stability. We are working actively with our international partners, including United Nations agencies and programmes  in the area of the environment, to continually develop renewable energy and reduce gas emissions in accordance with our international commitments. Given the complexity of the 2030 Agenda, we are pursuing several other initiatives as part of our comprehensive sustainable development vision, which we are implementing together with the United Nations and our partners, in line with the new integrated approach.\nWhile the United Nations  managed to  establish  a vision for reform in  the  field  of  development  in the General Assembly resolution adopted last May (resolution 72/91), in the security sphere, where political factors are more predominant, deficiencies persist. The effectiveness and relevance of the United Nations in that area cannot be fully achieved simply through the internal restructuring of its Secretariat. The delay in the reform of the Security Council over the past 25 years has not contributed to respect for the Charter of the United Nations, international law or the maintenance of international peace and security, which are the core prerogatives of the Organization.\nWe follow with great concern the violent conflicts that are taking place in various parts of the  world  with severe consequences for the civilian population. The inability of the Security Council to take effective measures in those situations raises a legitimate question about its relevance as a decision-making body for international security. From that perspective, reform is key to restoring the relevance and authority of the Security Council and, by extension, that of the entire United Nations, in matters of international peace and security. The Republic of Moldova supports the vision of an effective, representative, democratic and inclusive Security Council that is capable of swiftly responding\n \nto complex security challenges. Furthermore, as we have stated several times in the past, we advocate for the designation of an additional non-permanent seat in the Council to the Group of Eastern European States. And we hope that the membership of the General Assembly will come to an agreement on outstanding reform issues sooner rather than later.\nThe Charter of the United Nations requires the Organization to play a proactive role in maintaining international peace and security and in ensuring respect for Member States\u2019 sovereignty and territorial integrity. By bringing matters arising from challenges to their sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security before the General Assembly, Member States do not seek confrontation or the politicization of the work of the Assembly. It is only natural for such States to turn to the United Nations for assistance in promoting and encouraging solutions based on the strict observance of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nDuring the high-level segment of the seventy- second session of the General Assembly, I reiterated, from this high rostrum, the calls to the United Nations to focus meaningfully on a grave breach of international law and the Charter of  the United Nations, namely,  the continued presence of Russian military forces and armaments on the territory of the Republic of Moldova without our consent and against our express wishes (see A/72/PV.15). I also appealed to Member States to support the inclusion of an item focused on that pressing political, legal and security issue for the Republic of Moldova in the agenda of General Assembly. I am pleased to note that the General Assembly adopted a resolution that declared in a straightforward manner the incompatibility of the political preconditions that underpin the Russian Federation\u2019s continuing refusal to withdraw its military forces and armaments from Moldovan soil with the norms of international law and the Charter of the United Nations (resolution 72/282). By adopting that resolution, on 22 June, the General Assembly also unequivocally stressed that the Russian Federation\u2019s non-compliance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations has led to a clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and that Russia must withdraw its military forces unconditionally, completely and without further delay. The resolution is a first and important milestone for consolidating the support of the United Nations for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of  the Republic of  Moldova.  In that context,\nI would like to express our deep gratitude to  all  of  the Member States that sponsored that resolution or supported its adoption.\nLast week, following the recommendation by the General Committee, the General Assembly decided by consensus to include in the agenda of the seventy-third session a new item entitled \u201cComplete withdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova\u201d (see A/73/PV.3). The Government of the Republic of Moldova welcomes that important decision, which comes at a time when internal and subregional security has worsened owing to the repeated, unlawful and destabilizing activities undertaken by the foreign military forces and the unconstitutional power structures in the eastern part of the country. The military exercises conducted jointly by the operational group of Russian forces in Moldova, which are stationed illegally on our soil, and the paramilitaries of the unconstitutional power structures have increased in scope and frequency, which represents a continued violation of the 1992 Moldovan-Russian ceasefire agreement, which includes an explicit legally binding commitment on the part of the Russian Federation to ensure the neutrality of Russian military forces during the process of their withdrawal from the territory of the Republic of Moldova. The illegal joint military exercises are aimed at upgrading the military-offensive capacity of the unconstitutional power structures and at undermining international efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of the protracted Transnistrian problem. Other States members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have echoed the Republic of Moldova in its repeated expressions of deep concern with regard to those unlawful and ongoing destabilizing exercises, which run contrary to the obligations undertaken by the Russian Federation in the framework of the 5+2 international settlement format.\nFrom this rostrum today, we appeal once again to the Russian Federation to discontinue those illegal and provocative activities and to resume, unconditionally and without further delay, the process of withdrawing its troops and armaments, in accordance with its legal commitments under the 1999 OSCE Istanbul summit outcome document and in observance of its obligations under international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe  complete   and   unconditional   withdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova will undoubtedly facilitate the\n \nprocess of settling the Transnistrian conflict and help reintegrate the country. Despite the many difficulties encountered in the settlement process, the Moldovan authorities are determined to find a political solution to the protracted, externally generated conflict in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova, within the 5+2 negotiating format. For us, it is extremely important that that solution be based on full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, with the provision of a special status for the Transnistrian region, as stipulated in the relevant OSCE documents.\nI would now like to refer briefly to the goal of European integration, which guides the reform agenda of my country, particularly through the application of the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU). By aligning the Republic of Moldova with EU principles and standards and by harmonizing Moldovan national legislation with European legislation, we aim to bring our country closer to the EU and to ensure the sustainability of the modernization process.\nThe extent of our cooperation with the EU is broad. It includes several dimensions, including engaging in constructive and intensive political dialogue, creating a free and comprehensive trade zone, promoting intersectoral cooperation and taking stock of opportunities for collaboration within the Eastern Partnership. In economic terms, the Association Agreement is a big step forward for the economy of  the Republic of Moldova, as the European Union has become the country\u2019s main trading partner. Several positive results have been achieved that facilitate trade in key sectors, including increasing the competitiveness of our goods and services, and opening up new opportunities for local producers. I am convinced that the implementation of the Association Agreement is the best and most viable option for ensuring prosperity and sustainable development for the Republic of Moldova and will warrant making the path to EU integration irreversible.\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming the commitment of my country to continuously promoting respect for Charter of the United Nations and to contributing to the achievement of internationally agreed United Nations goals. I would also like to express the hope that the initiatives recently launched to strengthen the Organization\u2019s capacities will contribute to achieving improved performance in terms of development and international peace and security.\nWe shall remain true to United Nations ideals and will work to uphold the Organization\u2019s capacity to ensure respect for international law."

        "file_text": "First, I extend my warm congratulations to you, Madam President, on your election as President of  the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. Your election as the fourth woman to be elected to lead the Assembly represents a further step towards the better representation of women within our Organization, and I am convinced that the breadth of your well-grounded experience will benefit our work and provide the energy needed to move forward more effectively towards the achievement of our goals. I am exceptionally pleased that my Government has made the advancement of women one of its priorities. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend and thank your predecessor upon the completion of his term; he deserves my delegation\u2019s gratitude for his remarkable commitment during the previous session of the General Assembly.\nThe year 2018 has seen upheavals, transitions, changes and many instances of disorder in manifold forms, in the face of which we must continue to show our resolve and unity. Whether climatic, economic, social, political, migratory,  health-related  or  other in nature, those events must further mobilize the international community, which must become more solidary, committed and determined than ever. The current international context is increasingly demanding and requires that we react virtually immediately. The involvement of us all is therefore essential, given that all those situations can compromise peace and stability. That is what genuinely confers upon the United Nations its universality.\nThe  theme  chosen  for   the   seventy-third session \u2014 \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d \u2014 will make sense only if we translate our words into action. Today there is a need for shared responsibility. In order to meet all the challenges we face, we  must begin by making the Organization more equitable and\neffective by providing it with the resources necessary to accomplish its mission.\nTo that end, the much-desired reforms, particularly within the main organs of the United Nations \u2014 which, when delayed, give rise to a sense of injustice and frustration among the regions  that feel  least represented \u2014  must be  concrete in order to reflect, as closely and in the most balanced way possible, the current geopolitical realities, especially the recognition of the African continent. In that regard, the Union of the Comoros reiterates its support for the Ezulwini Consensus, which calls for the allocation of at least two permanent seats to Africa in the Security Council, with veto power.\nBy  having  equal  opportunities  to   invest   in the areas of peace and security, health, education, democracy and the rule of law, we will succeed in ensuring the harmonious development of our countries and in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the founding objective of the new era in which the Organization is entering.\nMy country also welcomes the relevance of the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals as part of the reforms he is undertaking, which will better reflect the priorities and needs of  countries and improve the functioning  of the Organization. On the other hand, that rationale must in no way decrease the presence of the United Nations on the ground. It is therefore important to stress that care must be taken to ensure that funding is predictable and that the poorest countries, in particular small island developing States, do not assume too great of a financial burden.\nI would like to welcome the  initiative  taken by the Assembly to attach particular importance to the consideration of topics relating to tuberculosis and non-communicable diseases. Need I remind those present that some of those diseases are no longer the prerogative of the poorest countries, in the sense that they are reappearing in the more affluent countries? We must strengthen the World Health Organization\u2019s work in the world, including by making substantial resources available to the agency. At the country level, we must assign importance to those problems and adopt appropriate and effective strategies to combat those diseases.\nThe situation in the Middle East is extremely worrisome. Yemen, Syria and Palestine need the Organization\u2019s unwavering support. In that regard,\n \nI would like to express the deep concern of my Government and of the Comorian people over the increase in arbitrary measures taken in recent months against the Palestinian people, the consequences of which not only significantly undermine the stability of the region but also weaken the collective effort towards a two-State solution.\nThat is why the Union of the Comoros reiterates its steadfast support for the Palestinian people and remains convinced that any viable solution to that conflict must involve the creation of both an Israeli and a Palestinian State, living side by side, in complete security, within secure and internationally recognized borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as Palestine\u2019s capital.\nHowever, our concern is all the more justified as we note that, unfortunately, the international community has gradually become a spectator of that peace process, which is stuck in a persistent stalemate that is likely to decrease the prospects for a just and lasting resolution. In view of recent events and positions, Member States must spend some time in reflection so as to reach consensus on developing a new mediation mechanism to finally relaunch the peace process.\nIn that regard, I welcome the adoption, in December 2017, of resolution ES-10/19, on the status of Jerusalem,  as  well  as  resolution  ES-10/20,  on  the protection of the Palestinian people, which was adopted in June by a majority of Member States and requests that the Secretary-General submit proposals to ensure the security, protection and well-being of the Palestinian population, in addition to recommendations on an international protection mechanism for Palestinian civilians.\nIn that vein, allow me to draw the attention of the members of the Assembly to the difficult situation that the Rohingya people continue to face. That innocent population is the target of attacks and persecutions that contravene the values enshrined in the Charter  of the United Nations. To that end, I would like to make a solemn appeal to the Assembly to assume its responsibilities in order to help that population, which is in great danger.\nWith regard to the question of Western Sahara, while we welcome the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 2414 (2018), which stresses the need to work towards a pragmatic, realistic and lasting political solution and calls on neighbouring States to cooperate\nfully with the United Nations, the Union of the Comoros wishes to express its thanks to the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy for succeeding in relaunching the political process on the basis of the parameters defined by the Security Council since 2007. The Union of the Comoros welcomes the serious and creditable efforts of the Kingdom of Morocco to find a definitive political solution and supports the Moroccan initiative for autonomy.\nBuilding international peace and security is a constant struggle and the result of many concessions. In the current context, the risks of a nuclear detonation are very real. We have a duty to protect present and future generations from the danger of the use of nuclear weapons.\nThe terrorist threat also continues to grow worldwide, and no country has been spared. Indeed, not a day goes by without there being victims somewhere in the world, owing to the madness of certain malicious people who use ideologies of all kinds to achieve their extremist ends and  commit  acts of unspeakable barbarity. Some say that they are acting in the name of Islam. That is entirely wrong. What Islam are they referring to? Islam, our Islam, is  a religion of peace and tolerance. It is therefore urgent to work together to strengthen mobilization efforts, in particular through information-sharing and the transfer of skills, to be able to effectively stamp out that threat.\nTo that end, sustained efforts must continue to be made with a view to achieving a common consensual language, which, beyond defining the various aspects of the terrorism spectrum, will enable the establishment of cooperation processes and action aimed at reducing the threat of terrorism at the national, regional and global levels. We must therefore support the Group of Five for the Sahel, the United Nations forces and Operation Barkhane in their joint efforts to fight terrorism in the Sahel region.\nSince it is equally necessary to find prompt and urgent solutions to the many situations of injustice that persist in the world, we must give priority to exchanges and do more to prevent such situations from arising. Why should we not become more involved in finding ways and means to deal with sensitive issues, such as migration, with humanity and celerity?\nIn that regard, the Union of the Comoros, through the coordination of the Group of African States, contributed to the negotiations on the landmark\n \ndocument promoting the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, the first document offering a 360-degree perspective on migration governance and the first internationally recognized normative and regulatory framework in the area of migration governance.\nThe global compact reiterates our commitment to addressing socioeconomic causes and determinants, including through international cooperation, as well as our obligation to protect the human rights of migrants and promote the fight against all forms of racism and discrimination against them. Among other things, the compact advocates voluntary migration and recognizes the positive contribution of migrants and diasporas to sustainable development in countries of origin, transit and destination.\nIn order to ensure a safer world, we must also pay close attention to the ever-growing issue of climate change, particularly in small island developing States, of which my country, the Union of the Comoros, is one. While exacerbating the destruction of ecosystems and biodiversity, climate change is also likely to increase poverty and various diseases and lead to an upsurge in climate-related migration, thereby compromising our future and that of future generations.\nAt the national level, major events marking a decisive turning point in the sociopolitical evolution  of my country have taken place this year that merit being brought to the attention of the Assembly. As I announced in my statement at the United Nations last year (see A/72/PV.13), we held a national conference in February of this year to take stock of the 42 years  of independence of the Union of the Comoros. That civil-society-driven initiative benefited not only from the support of the Government but also from the multifaceted support of development partners and many regional and international organizations, including the African Union, the League of Arab States, the International Organization of la Francophonie and the United Nations.\nI would like to reiterate my sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for sending senior officials to the opening and closing of the conference. The conclusions drawn from that national forum highlighted the need to redefine and redesign a new institutional framework that would, while consolidating national unity, pave the way for the emergence of a new Comoros by 2030. A\nreferendum was held on 30 July, and a new Constitution was adopted.\nIn full support of that reform process willed by the Comorian people, I have decided to shorten my term of office and to prepare, under the new Constitution and the established deadlines, early regional and national elections. In that connection, I solemnly appeal to our development partners and all the countries that are friends of the Comoros to support us in meeting that new challenge of the future. I remain confident that, as usual, their valuable support will be be forthcoming to ensure that future elections will be conducted in peace, harmony and transparency.\nWith regard to the Comorian island of Mayotte, popular uprisings there in March led the authorities  on that island to massively expel Comorians from the other three islands who were residing on Mayotte. The conditions of their refoulement forced my Government to oppose that unilateral decision, especially since many of those people are adolescents who have become street children since their families were driven out of Mayotte under the same conditions that we denounce today. Since their parents\u2019 refoulement from Mayotte without any care, those abandoned children pose a real threat today not only to the island but also to the rest of the archipelago, and even to the whole region.\nThe misunderstanding between France and the Union of the Comoros originates from that situation, which is compounded by the shock felt by the Comorians of the other three islands at seeing the difficult conditions of detention of their fellow citizens on Mayotte. The Government is committed to engaging in dialogue with France to resolve everything  that puts us at odds, or  has the potential to do  so.  We  are a peaceful country by nature, despite the many bumps that have marked our shared history. We have historical and cultural links with France. For that reason, we are determined to move forward towards a successful and just solution to that problem.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to pay warm tribute to the people of the Comoros as a whole for the unanimity and solidarity they have shown in relation to the Government\u2019s position in  that  new  twist  on the Mayotte issue. We have utilized active, measured and effective diplomacy to take due account of all the dimensions of the issue. I welcome the commitment of Comorians, alongside the Government, which is making every effort to ensure that, together with France, we can\n \nresolve the current unfortunate situation on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nTo close that chapter, I trust that, together with France\u2019s top officials, we can find a lasting solution to that very troublesome dispute between partners, which has lasted far too long for two countries that should be united by many factors, as confirmed by the late French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand.\nOn that question, as on the others that are the subject of our debate here, our responsibility is to provide answers, because in the Indian Ocean, Africa and throughout the world our duty is to leave future generations with a world of peace, stability and sustainable development. I want to believe that we can do it.\n"

        "file_text": "I would first like to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, and to wish her success in her important work. I would also like to express my appreciation to Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, for his skilled and effective efforts in the position.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is taking place against a background of complex trends in international politics. In spite of the efforts of the international community, particularly through the\n \nUnited Nations, the situation in a number of regions around the world remains very difficult. Conflict-prone areas have spread, while at the same time the general level of trust and mutual understanding in our views on the pathways and prospects for global development has fallen. In such circumstances, the issue of ensuring comprehensive, solid and long-term security becomes all too apparent and pertinent, laying the responsibility for the destiny of humankind at the door of every State.\nWe believe that the United Nations is called on to play the main and decisive role in preserving the foundations of our international order on the basis of the principles of mutual respect, equality and peaceful political dialogue. There can be no doubt as to the legitimacy  of its mission. It is the only universal international organization designed to ensure multilateral cooperation aimed at strengthening international security and sustainable development. Turkmenistan believes that this session of  the  General  Assembly  should  help  to resolve the crisis of trust and strengthen mutual understanding among the States Members of the United Nations. In that regard Turkmenistan is launching an initiative marking 2019 as a year of peace and trust. Our initiative proposes developing specific measures aimed at reducing tensions and promoting the peaceful political and diplomatic resolution of disputes and clashes by adopting responsible and balanced decisions.\nEnsuring long-term security is a key issue for Central Asian States, and one of the most important issues on the regional agenda is the fight against terrorism. With regard to ensuring security and stable development  in the  Central Asian States, cooperation\non disarmament matters, combating drug trafficking and multilateral economic support for Afghanistan are no less important. In that regard we believe it is crucial to involve Afghanistan in implementing major energy, transport and communications projects as a full- fledged partner. We see that issue as one of strategic importance for Afghanistan and its role in regional and global processes, and one that will help the Afghan people\u2019s prosperity and well-being to flourish.  We  are working steadily towards that goal. My country is working to implement the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan-India pipeline project, building a power supply line and a fibre-optic communications network with the support of international partners and major financial institutions. A new railway leading towards Afghanistan has also been completed. We continue to provide Afghanistan with humanitarian assistance by building social facilities, sending humanitarian aid convoys and training qualified national  specialists  for various sectors of Afghanistan\u2019s economic and social arenas.\nTurkmenistan participated actively in the drafting of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and made a number of specific proposals. Following the adoption at the World Summit of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 (see A/70/PV.4), our country was one of  the first nations  to begin adapting its national plans and social and economic development programmes in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. In that regard we have established an appropriate permanent mechanism for cooperation with the United Nations. Turkmenistan\u2019s implementation of the SDGs focuses particularly on social aspects. That  means  such  important  issues  as ensuring food security and improving nutrition, comprehensively promoting a healthy way of life, ensuring full gender equality by guaranteeing rights and opportunities for all women and girls and creating the conditions for comprehensive, equitable and high- quality education.\nWe are also devoting a great deal of attention to achieving the goal of ensuring the availability and intelligent use of water resources and  sanitation for all. Turkmenistan firmly adheres to the principle that water is the common heritage of every people on our planet and that equal and fair access to clean drinking water is a fundamental human right. The development of States on the economic and social fronts, as well as their peoples\u2019 levels of well-being and quality of life, is\n \ndirectly dependent on their access to water resources and ability to use them effectively. Equal rights, mutual respect and responsibility  should  therefore be the main criteria determining relations among the States of Central Asian. In consistently taking that position, Turkmenistan has always declared that issues related to water and energy in our region should be resolved, first, on a basis of generally accepted norms of international law; secondly, by taking the interests of each country into account; and thirdly, with the active participation of international organizations and the United Nations in particular. That is our principled position, and based on it we will continue working to establish effective negotiating mechanisms between States and international entities with a view to arriving at a coordinated approach. I believe firmly that this is the only way we can achieve positive results and ensure a stable and sustainable balance of interests.\nOne of the major topics of cooperation between the countries of our region and the international community is the problem of saving the Aral Sea. It has long been clear that its preservation cannot be considered merely a problem internal to the region. If we are to succeed in finding a solution to it we need the help of the world community and an innovative, comprehensive international approach involving the active and systematic participation of the United Nations. In that regard, Turkmenistan has begun to implement an initiative formulating a special United Nations programme for the problem of the Aral Sea basin and establishing it  as  a  specific separate area of the Organization\u2019s  work.  I  urge  Member  States to support our proposal, for which the Assembly\u2019s resolution 72/273, on \u201cCooperation between the United Nations and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea\u201d, adopted by consensus on 12 April, could serve as a good basis.\nAnother major issue is the Caspian Sea. The signing by the Heads of States of the Caspian Sea on 12 August of the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea has opened up the prospects for transforming the Caspian Sea region into an internationally important strategic transit and energy hub, as well as an area for broad investment, trade and economic activity and cooperation. Turkmenistan is ready for meaningful discussions with all interested parties on implementing projects in those areas that are  fully  economically and commercially feasible, beneficial for all potential participants, capable of significantly helping to\nstrengthen the security of the continent and long-term in nature. It is no exaggeration to say that investing in such projects is undoubtedly an investment in the future.\nWe greatly appreciate the effective participation  of the United Nations specialized agencies represented in Turkmenistan and in our country\u2019s life, dynamic development and people\u2019s  welfare, and I  would like  to express our sincere gratitude to their staff for their selfless work. I would also like to thank Secretary- General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his tireless personal focus on United Nations cooperation with Turkmenistan and his support to our initiatives and endeavours.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me join other  world leaders    in     congratulating     Her      Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. Zambia fully supports her endeavour to diligently discharge her responsibilities in the Assembly. We are delighted to note that, after more than a decade, a woman has once again taken up this important seat as the fourth female President of the General Assembly since the establishment of this world body.\nAs the United Nations celebrates its seventy-third anniversary next month, it needs to forcefully continue to promote international peace, cooperation and the\n \ndevelopment of societies that are free from hunger, poverty and disease. In doing so, we should endeavour to explore new ideas and best practices to meet the expectations of our people, against a backdrop of the effective and efficient use of limited global resources. We are therefore confident that the President will bring a fresh dimension to the fore as we jointly seek solutions to the economic, social and political challenges that confront us.\nSince the founding of the United Nations  73  years ago, we believe that Africa should have made remarkable progress. Yet Africa\u2019s economic structure has only minimally changed. That is a concern that has been voiced at both continental and global forums. The effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 of the African Union therefore presents huge opportunities for Africa to revitalize its growth and accelerate its transformation. Both frameworks seek to achieve inclusive growth, sustainable development and peace and security for the continent.\nZambia\u2019s development path is guided by its Vision 2030 through the implementation of its seventh national development plan, which is focused on transforming Zambia into a prosperous middle-income country by 2030. To achieve that, we must overcome many hurdles. Our economy, like many other developing economies, needs to diversify. We are therefore determined to address our challenges by creating a diversified and resilient economy that is driven by the agriculture, tourism and energy sectors, among others. That will be supported by a robust infrastructure development programme. In that regard, we  need  strengthened  and mutually beneficial partnerships  in  the  context of South-South cooperation, as well as regional and development cooperation, which remain crucial to unlocking diversified growth.\nZambia is dedicated to the implementation of Agenda 2063 of the African Union, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, including on  climate  change, and of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third International Conference on Financing for Development. That is why my Government has mainstreamed those global development agendas in its seventh national development plan.\nI am glad to note that my Government has been making steady progress in infrastructure development\nas a key enabler for recovery and improvement. We  are also implementing several policies and structural reforms under the Economic Stabilization and Growth Programme. As we pursue those goals, we are mindful of the challenges in mobilizing financing for development, as well as declining donor funding, particularly for least-developed countries and landlocked developing countries. We therefore call on all partners to work with us to ensure that together we can effectively implement the Sustainable Development Goals for the good of  our people.\nIt is gratifying to note that the second United Nations High-level Conference on South-South Cooperation, to be held in March 2019 in Buenos Aires, will present  an opportunity to register significant progress on development  cooperation  among  the  countries  of the South.\nTo turn to the issue of peace, since 1945 the United Nations and the international community have been consistently and strongly advocating the  need for the preservation and promotion of peace. Recent development frameworks have also given prominence to efforts to protect global peace and security. My Government therefore fully supports Security Council resolution 2378 (2017), which focuses on peacekeeping reforms. Zambia is also committed to the Secretary- General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative, as set out in the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, sent to Member States by the Secretary-General in August.\nI am also glad to say that my Government has recently increased its participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations and is currently a major contributor to peacekeeping missions. Zambia is also one of the countries that has taken the lead in increasing women\u2019s participation in peacekeeping operations. We also join other Member States in saluting the gallant men and women in blue helmets for the sacrifices they are making to foster peace in the world.\nIn our continuing efforts to contribute to regional and world peace, Zambia recently took up the chairmanship of the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security of the Southern African Development Community. I can only assure Member States that we will discharge that duty with the utmost dedication to the cause of regional and world peace and security.\nOn gender equality and women\u2019s economic empowerment, I want to reaffirm my Government\u2019s\n \ncommitment to eliminating all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls. We are making efforts to review and enact new legislation and policies that are gender responsive. Progress is also being recorded on the implementation of our 50-50 enrolment policy, as schools are now compelled by law to enrol equal numbers of girls and boys.\nIn 2017 my Government commenced the distribution of free sanitary napkins to girls in rural and suburban areas in an effort to keep girls in school. That programme was introduced in order to improve girls\u2019 access to education, as a lack of proper sanitary napkins often limits their ability to attend school. In addition, we have continued to implement the re-entry policy for pregnant girls. That programme is a success, as a number of girls have been retained in school after giving birth. We believe that measure is critical to ensuring equal opportunities for our girls. We  have  no doubt that those and many other efforts will lay a firm foundation for our attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 5, on gender equality and women\u2019s economic empowerment.\nThe world has continued to witness unprecedented mass movements of refugees and  migrants,  which has had political, social, economic and human rights ramifications for a number of host countries. Let me underscore the importance of collaborative efforts on the part of the global community in tackling issues relating to the current refugee and migration crisis. That will ensure safe, orderly and regular migration involving full respect for human rights and the humane treatment of migrants and refugees. We therefore welcome the convening in December of the Conference on International Migration and look forward to the upcoming adoption of the unprecedented global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration. We are hopeful that this will provide us with an opportunity to improve global governance on migration and refugees, as well as to strengthen the contribution of migrants  to sustainable development. In that regard, I want to underline the importance of respecting the  principle of shared responsibility for hosting  and  supporting the world\u2019s refugees and migrants. Going forward, I want to reaffirm my Government\u2019s commitment to its international obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, whereby we will continue to play a  meaningful role  in assisting people affected by conflict situations and other human rights violations.\nI want to recognize the decision by the Secretary- General and his team regarding the progress made in fulfilling his mandate for reform of the United Nations development system, United Nations management and the peace and security pillar. However, we are deeply concerned about the fact that negligible progress has been made on reforming the Security Council. We also want to recall that in 2000, during the Millennium Summit, world leaders called for a speedy and logical conclusion to the negotiations on Security Council reform. Five years later, at the World Summit, leaders expressed concern at the slow pace of progress and urged that negotiations on Security Council reform be expedited. To date, we are still no closer to agreement on a fundamental issue that seeks to make the United Nations truly representative, democratic and effective.\nThe year 2019 will mark the fortieth anniversary since reform of the Security Council became an item on the agenda of the General Assembly. The President of the Assembly has been entrusted by world leaders with leading the process of reforming the Security Council. We are therefore hopeful that she will report substantive progress by the time we mark the fortieth anniversary next year. I want to reiterate that Africa remains steadfast and united in its call for two permanent and five non-permanent seats on the Security Council. Not only is that a matter of common decency involving the correction of a historical injustice, it is also a matter of restoring the dignity of Africa, which today remains the only continent without permanent representation on the Council. In that regard, we also support the call for a non-permanent seat for small island developing countries, whose challenges are so unique that it is imperative that their perspective be  incorporated as   a new dimension into the United Nations approach to international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "Yesterday, our Secretary-General provided his view of the international situation and the challenges that we all face (see A/73/PV.6). His view was a mixed  one, to say the least. We are experiencing a decline in multilateralism on all fronts and a challenge to the basis of the international system based on respect for the rule of law.\n \nHowever, multilateralism and respect for the rule of law ensure that democracies can play an international role. They are even a prerequisite for the exercise of their sovereignty. Nowhere is the need for and evidence of the merits of multilateralism more present than in common projects to establish and maintain peace. The European Union is an excellent example in that regard. I am part of the generation born in Europe that has never experienced war. It appears that we take that for granted. However, we must not forget that there are conflicts just beyond our borders.\nThe same holds true in the area of international trade. In that regard, the increasing number of multilateral measures and counter-measures will eventually undermine our growth.  We  are  strongly in favour of resuming negotiations and constructive engagement through the World  Trade  Organization. If that does not occur, all parties are at the risk of losing out. That would entail being open to discussions on sensitive and difficult subjects.\nSome challenges can be solved only at the global level. Migration is the best example of that kind of challenge. Demographic trends suggest that it is likely that the issue will be on the agenda for a few generations. We hope that the global compact  for  safe,  orderly and regular migration to  be  adopted  in  Marrakech in December this year will provide a framework for understanding the global phenomenon in countries of origin, transit and destination. It should also lead to better management of migration flows at the regional level. In the European Union, we know that it should allow for the establishment of common policies and solidarity mechanisms among Member States with regard to accepting refugees. It is regrettable that some countries have forgotten that their citizens were once refugees from somewhere in the world.\nMy country has made considerable efforts since 2015 to receive asylum seekers, including through resettlement and relocation mechanisms. The global compact\u2019s comprehensive framework for migration has made it possible to determine what is expected of countries of origin and destination, but also \u2014 and this is very important \u2014 what is expected of migrants with regard to their integration.\nThe issue of integration has often been linked to the rise of populism in Europe. Let me inform the Assembly that countries of various sizes within the European Union, including large ones, had populist Governments\nbefore the 2015 migration crisis. Moreover, those same countries now challenge the founding principles of the European Union pertaining to respect for the rule of law. I would like to note today \u2014 and condemn \u2014 the fact that some political parties have become successful by exploiting the weakest.\nOf course, a clear distinction must be made between political refugees and economic migrants. Those who want to survive \u2014 those who flee rape, violence, persecution, imprisonment and death \u2014must be able to find safe haven on our continent.\nWe have heard warnings from the Secretary- General and from the scientific community: if we continue along the current path, we will not achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. We do not  know exactly how much humankind contributes to global warming or to climate change, but we have the facts, which, month after month, year after year, show with certainty that we must act because we have a responsibility to future generations. I can only welcome all initiatives to maintain or restore the momentum of the Paris Agreement, including the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal to convene another climate summit next year on the sidelines of the General Assembly.\nManaging climate change is one of the most important goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda\u2019s\n17 Sustainable Development Goals is  progressing well, and the international community is engaged, in particular through national plans, keeping in mind that each Member State is free to focus on its own priorities. It is clear that the issue of financing the Sustainable Development Goals remains a problem.\nWith regard to climate change, specific mechanisms have been developed nationally and internationally and through the private  sector.  Mechanisms  exist but resources remain insufficient. Luxembourg now has a green stock exchange with a capitalization of\n$50 billion \u2014 the largest of its kind. We also have a goal to create similar mechanisms for other Sustainable Development Goals. However, the response of the financial sector remains lukewarm. That is because, first, traditional operators are unaware of the potential of new markets and, secondly, compliance obligations are imposed on supervisory authorities in developed countries.\nAs we know, the share of official development assistance is decreasing, and other mechanisms must\n \nbe found to shore up the lack of resources, in particular for the least developed countries. The need to diversify the sources of development assistance cannot relieve us of our official development assistance obligations. For its part, my country will continue to devote\n1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance.\nLike the majority of countries, we experienced a rather challenging period in terms of budgetary matters. Reducing the budget allocated to cooperation would have been welcomed by some. I mention that simply because, in developed countries with considerable income, we wonder if we should have a hot meal or a cold meal but, in some countries, mothers wonder if they will be able to feed their children at all for the next few days. We  forget how lucky we are. I believe  it is important to share what we have. I know that  there is consensus on that issue in my country. Even after legislative elections in two weeks, I believe the consensus will remain and that the next Government will follow suit.\nThe effectiveness of development aid is of course not only dependent on financial resources. In that regard, the Secretary-General\u2019s reform of the development sector has our full support. In particular, the policy and practice of United Nations development agencies should be aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Coordination among agencies, the development of joint projects and the establishment of a new resident coordinator system could give us the flexibility and adaptability necessary for the effective implementation of development projects on the ground.\nI highlighted the Secretary-General\u2019s reforms because we believe that our country plays a special role in the area of development. However, reforms in the area of peace and security and within the management pillar of the Secretariat are important and should receive the same strong support. Such efforts must succeed because they also contribute to ensuring lasting support for multilateral institutions. Reform in the area of peace and security should enable the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping operations to be more effective and flexible, while bearing in mind that deployment modalities do not always meet needs.\nAfrica is one of the regions where the United Nations is most present through peacekeeping operations, development assistance and humanitarian programmes and projects. West Africa and the Sahel are now a\nhotbed of instability, terrorism, organized crime and trafficking of all kinds. Only through coordinated and concerted action with regional and national stakeholders and international institutions can the burgeoning number of threats in the region be contained. For its part, my country focuses a  considerable  percentage of its development assistance on countries in that particular region. By way of example, let me outline our efforts in Mali.\nOur programme for that country has a budget of\n\u20ac61 million for  the  period  2015-2019.  Luxembourg is one of the main donors to the Office of the Independent Observer, responsible for evaluating the implementation of the ceasefire agreement between the Government and armed groups in the north of the country. Since 2012, it has funded the establishment of the International Commission of Inquiry for Mali to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. My country also contributes to the development of a compliance framework for respect for human rights and international humanitarian law to be used in operations of the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel).\nWe allocate approximately \u20ac1.15 million to security and defence. Starting this year, my country has also been participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and deploys army officers to provide air support. In line with commitments made during the Brussels conference in February, Luxembourg will contribute approximately\n\u20ac500,000 in medical support to the G-5 Sahel Joint Force and \u20ac600,000 to build a field hospital in S\u00e9var\u00e9. Luxembourg\u2019s contribution clearly remains modest. I would simply like to show what a small country like Luxembourg can contribute when international and regional coordination structures are put in place.\nThe situation in the Near and Middle East, as well as in the southern Mediterranean region of Libya, inspires less optimism. It must be  highlighted  that the stalemate in the peace process between Israel and Palestine remains completely unresolved, and the situation, it must be said, has deteriorated since the last session of the General Assembly. We will never tire of recalling the principles of international law that must form the basis for peace. There can be no doubt about Israel\u2019s right to exist or about the right of Palestinians to their own State. The two-State solution is the only fair and lasting solution.\n \nThe explosive situation in Libya is the result of tensions that are specific to Libya\u2019s  tribal structure.  It is also due to the fact that the country serves as a sounding board for tensions in the Sahel and Arab- Muslim worlds. The interest of the international community, primarily the United Nations and its Special Envoy, is therefore multifaceted. The political solution reached among the Libyan parties will also determine the control of migration flows to Europe. It is obviously not a question of locking up the migrants in camps, in intolerable and disgraceful conditions of slavery, in the twenty-first century.\nThe war in Syria has led to a huge humanitarian crisis. It has claimed the lives of countless people. Half of the population is displaced, either internally  or abroad. After the tragedy of eastern Ghouta at the beginning of the year, more than 3 million people are now threatened in the Idlib region. The means used in the war by the warring parties have been extreme in terms of their violence and cruelty, including the use of chemical weapons, which is both beyond understanding and unacceptable.\nIt is simply incomprehensible and shameful that the international community has been unable, by means  of veto, to renew an instrument designed to establish the facts and responsibilities for the use of chemical weapons. We hope that the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of those Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, established by resolution 71/248, will have access to data collected by the Joint Investigation Mechanism so that it can ensure justice when the time comes.\nThe humanitarian commitment of my country in the Syrian conflict is by far our most significant and stands at \u20ac7.5 million per year for the period 2016-2020, as I personally announced at the conference in London. Luxembourg will also participate in the latest appeal for additional  contributions  from  the Department  of Political Affairs in support of the United Nations political efforts in Syria. It will also provide an amount of \u20ac200,000 to allow the Mechanism to be operational. The tragedy of the war in Syria has led to a situation that is all the more intractable, especially since it combines the interplay of powers, regional rivalries and religious conflict.\nThe humanitarian tragedy in Yemen has caused destruction, displacement, hunger and cholera. The war raging there has also been extremely cruel. We must expeditiously put in place the means to establish accountability and fight impunity. The role of the United Nations, in particular its Special Envoy and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, is crucial if we are to avoid further aggravating the situation and to pave the way for a political solution.\nIn the two foregoing conflicts, the regional Powers play an important,  although  not  always  positive, role. That is the case for Iran. We share the concerns expressed by the United States and its allies regarding Iran\u2019s  influence in the Middle East, which is  likely to destabilize the situation in many neighbouring countries. From our point of view, however, that does not mean that we should call into question Iran\u2019s nuclear deal, which we believe, if not perfect, provides tangible guarantees in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. We regret that the United States has denounced that agreement, which was the subject of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) and continues to bind the international community.\nWith regard to nuclear non-proliferation, we hope that the process initiated between the United States and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, with the support of South Korea, will lead to concrete results in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\nIn addition to the trend towards  unilateralism and the reconsideration of the rule of law, we must unfortunately note a deterioration in the human rights situation across the globe. That is true in conflict situations, where the use of intimidation policies, ethnic cleansing and widespread sexual violence is increasingly common, particularly among non-State actors. It is also true due to the phenomenon whereby the very existence of certain categories of human rights is denied and the legitimacy of certain human rights institutions is being called into question.\nThe situation of the Rohingya in Myanmar is emblematic of such a development. There is a tangle  of ethnic cleansing, massacres, intimidation and rape, with an entire population forced to flee without much that the international community can do, except to organize reception in a neighbouring territory and to simply note the scale of the disaster. In that regard, one of the positive developments is the fact that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been seized of\n \nthe situation because more than 700,000 refugees have been driven into Bangladesh, which is a State party to the Rome Statute. We fully support the work of the ICC on that issue, as well as in the other investigations that it conducts.\nWe do not accept that the legitimacy and the very existence of the Court should be questioned on the pretext of State sovereignty. In accordance with the principle of complementarity, the ICC intervenes only in the event of the failure of States to act.\nOur support to the Human Rights Council and its work remains as strong as ever. We see the institution as a fundamental pillar of the United Nations system. The Council can be reformed without challenging its mandate and modus operandi. We have supported efforts in that regard. However, we regret the decision of the United States to withdraw its participation from the Human Rights Council, even though it was an ally in the defence of human rights at the global level. We hope that reform efforts will continue, and we will also contribute to them from within, if Luxembourg is elected to the Council for the term 2022-2024.\nHuman rights cover many facets, such as  civil and political rights and economic and social rights,    to mention only the most traditional ones, but there is also a new category of rights, including sexual rights and reproductive health rights. We regret that the latter are too often undermined not only in their principles but also in their exercise, including through United Nations programmes and projects aimed at giving women and girls control over their lives and access to family planning.\nIn that context, my country provides financial support to the programmes of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UN-Women,  as well as the Girls Not Brides initiative, in the amount of\n\u20ac600,000 and \u20ac400,000, respectively, for 2019. We also support a UNICEF-UNFPA project to eliminate genital mutilation, which stands at \u20ac400,000.\nThe United Nations gives legitimacy to multilateralism and all other organizations and institutions that call for it. That is why we must tirelessly take up that principle. Only then can we undertake the important work that lies ahead and face the challenges of globalization. A return to the private preserve of nationalism has never been an option for Luxembourg, and neither is it today for anybody \u2014 above all, the countries in this Hall.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my honour and pleasure to deliver my maiden statement in the General Assembly. Allow me to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to preside over the Assembly at its seventy-third session. As  only the fourth woman in the history of the United Nations to hold that important position, her election is indeed most appropriate in terms of addressing gender equality within the Organization. The theme that she has chosen, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, resonates well with the mantra of the 2030  Agenda  for Sustainable Development, namely, to leave no one behind. The theme is a timely reminder for us to keep the momentum going three years after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nAlso at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a promise to end all forms of poverty. That shared vision and common destiny require us all to do our part in order to meet the ambitious targets and create a better world. For us in the developing world, the eradication of poverty is at the top of our agenda priorities. Development must equally be placed at the centre of the work of the United Nations, as it  plays  an important role in preventing hunger, deprivation, food insecurity, disease and, ultimately, conflict. The inclusion of the interests and views of women, young people, children and vulnerable members of our societies should be integral and essential components in all our programmes.\nI am pleased to report that Zimbabwe has made substantial progress in the implementation of  some  of the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular with regard to ensuring food security. Through our people-centred policies and planned programmes, complemented by private-sector financing and investments, farmers receive inputs, equipment and technical support. In a bid to improve nutrition and broaden income opportunities, we have also extended support to grow the livestock, fisheries and wildlife sectors. We are confident that those multipronged programmes will accelerate Zimbabwe\u2019s re-entry into the global economy and associated value chains. That is one example of innovation, creativity and home-grown solutions in addressing key development and economic challenges despite the continued illegal sanctions imposed on our country. We call for their immediate and unconditional removal. Meanwhile, we look forward to the first overall review of the implementation of the SDGs, to be held under the auspices of the General Assembly in 2019.\nPeace, security, stability, democracy and good governance are essential ingredients of sustainable development. In view of the fact that elections are an integral element of democracy, my country held its much-anticipated harmonized general  elections on  30 July. Following my deliberate and conscious decision to open up democratic space and my emphatic call for peace, unity and tolerance of divergent views among our people, political contestations, election campaigning, voting and counting processes were conducted freely, peacefully and transparently. In the spirit of transparency and openness, a broader spectrum of international\n \nobservers and global media houses were  accredited  to observe our elections. The exceptionally peaceful pre-  and  post-electoral  environments  represented the maturing and entrenchment of democracy in Zimbabwe. We are grateful to the United Nations and other Member States for sending election observer missions and for the technical assistance received by our election management body. The recommendations will be taken into account as we deepen our democratic and electoral processes.\nWe will continue to entrench constitutionalism, democratic traditions, norms, peace, unity and harmony, for it is indeed under such conditions that sustainable development, inclusive economic growth and prosperity can occur. The isolated and unfortunate incident of post-election violence that occurred on 1 August, is regrettable and most  unacceptable.  A  commission of inquiry comprised of eminent persons of national, regional and international repute has begun its work in earnest. Its ultimate report and recommendations will help us bring closure to the matter and assist in the improvement of our institutional governance.\nNow that the elections are behind us, my country is focusing on economic development as we seek to jumpstart  the modernization  and  industrialization of our country. The land reform programme is irreversibly behind us. Emboldened by the dreams, hopes and aspirations of our people, and in tandem with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063, we have outlined our vision to become a middle-income economy with  a per capita income of approximately $3,500.  That will bring on board increased investment, decent  jobs, broad-based empowerment and a society free from poverty and corruption by 2030. Zimbabwe is open for business, and  we  are presently  undertaking a raft of economic and political reforms to ensure an environment that facilitates inclusive and sustained economic growth. We have put in place institutions and instruments that maximize land utilization and increase agricultural productivity. Equally, strategies are in place in the various sectors of our economy to enable my country to enter the global value chain. The development and modernization of our roads, railways, airports, energy and information and communications technology infrastructure are being accelerated. in line with our regional and continental quest for enhanced connectivity and integrated infrastructure.\nZimbabwe looks forward to playing a positive and constructive role as a free, democratic, transparent, prosperous and responsible member of the family of nations. We are committed to strengthening dialogue, cooperation and partnerships, underpinned by mutual respect, common values and shared principles. The prevention of conflict must be a front-line strategy. My country remains committed to strengthening multilateralism and the peaceful resolution of differences. In that regard, we should  address  the root causes of conflict, which include poverty, inequality, deprivation and disputes over land and resources, as well as struggles for self-determination. Peacemaking and peacekeeping must be complemented by peacebuilding efforts to prevent the recurrence of and relapse into conflict. Zimbabwe continues to make its modest contributions through the deployment of its personnel to various United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions.\nThe United Nations  and  its  organs are in need  of being democratized. We  join  the  call  for  Africa to be represented in the permanent category and to have increased representation in the non-permanent category. That position is indeed justified in view of the need to correct the historical injustice that has left the African continent on the periphery of all major global decision-making processes. We emphatically call for the review and reform of the Bretton Woods and other international financial institutions. Trade is an engine for development if conducted fairly and in accordance with agreed rules. We therefore call for negotiations, under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, that would foster inclusive and shared economic growth and further advance the global development agenda.\nIn the spirit of leaving no one behind, our efforts to promote a global partnership for peace and development will never be complete unless we address the plight of people living under occupation. It is most saddening that some of us continue to turn a blind eye to the suffering of the people of Palestine. It is high time that the United Nations fulfil its obligations and duties under the Charter by implementing all its relevant resolutions, including General Assembly resolution 181\n(II) and Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 2334 (2016).\nOn the African continent, it is equally disheartening that the people of Western Sahara have yet to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. We call on the Security Council to insist on the holding of an\n \nindependent referendum for the Sahrawi people without delay, in compliance with the relevant decisions of the African Union and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. Furthermore, it is imperative and urgent for the Council to work tirelessly to strengthen its cooperation with the African Union Peace and Security Council in the search for a just and fair solution to the issue of Western Sahara.\nClimate change poses a threat to all of humankind, and its impact respects no borders. We therefore call for collective action and  responsibility  concerning the matter. As a developing country,  Zimbabwe  seeks support in the areas of adaptation, mitigation, technology, finance and capacity-building, as envisaged in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Zimbabwe\u2019s commitment to the principles of the Charter and pledge to continue to work with other nations in promoting and strengthening multilateralism for the good of humankind. Now more than ever, the United Nations must exert its authority and work harder for peace in a world where might is increasingly regarded as right. Let us work together in harmony to ensure that the United Nations and all its organs truly serve the collective interests of all Member States. As global leaders, we have a shared and onerous obligation to transform our societies and create a more peaceful and inclusive world for present and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "One decade ago, the world was convulsed by a cataclysmic collapse of its economic order. The devastating global economic and financial crisis began in the boardrooms of greedy banks and spread worldwide, with a rapidity that exposed the shortcomings of an unethical and unregulated international financial architecture. The adverse socioeconomic impact of the crisis has been vast and far-reaching, especially for the countries least responsible for the genesis of the crisis.\nRegrettably, the seemingly self-evident  lessons  of that economic and financial catastrophe have been distorted and manipulated to disastrous effect. While the financial architecture has been quietly reassembled, with little more than ineffectual cosmetic  changes, the post-crisis socioeconomic and political landscape has been radically reordered. Economic difficulties have caused most of the major nations to look inward, eschewing the most noble and beneficial aspects of global cooperation. Craven demagogues, clothed in populist robes, have emerged to exploit economic hardship and fan the flames of division, hatred and isolation. In all corners of the globe, the jarring rise of illiberal intolerance can be causally connected to the economic crisis and its continuing impact.\n \nSolidarity has been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, illustrating the enduring prescience of the late Kofi Annan\u2019s observation that when economic conditions are difficult, people tend to be less generous and protect themselves. The question of solidarity does not mean much to them at that time. We have retreated from the ethos of integration, cooperation and consensus-building that not only animated the pre-crisis decade but is absolutely necessary to solve the global problems that confront us.\nIn a technologically connected, increasingly educated and rapidly shrinking global village, any belated attempt to put the genies of multilateralism  and globalization back into their respective bottles is a dangerous folly. Walls cannot replace bridges, isolation cannot replace cooperation and clenched fists cannot shake hands.\nThe United Nations is not without its many systemic flaws, and the ascendancy of its unprincipled antithesis demands that we address those flaws urgently. However, after seven decades, the United Nations remains the world\u2019s only institution with the capacity and authority to enable global cooperation for our collective ennoblement.\nThe well-chosen theme for this general debate speaks to the relevance of the United Nations, global leadership  and  shared  responsibility.  It  centres  on  a recommitment to the bedrock foundations of the Charter of the United Nations: sovereign equality, non-interference and non-intervention, international peace and security, respect for international law and collective cooperation in solving global problems. It is precisely when times are most tumultuous and when damaging changes are upon us that principles must be most unwavering and fundamental truths must be most vigorously upheld.\nThe principles of non-intervention and non-interference are of particular importance to small island developing States. Lacking military might or economic wealth, and constrained within narrow borders, we owe our existence as nation States to a global recognition and respect for the principle that  no other nation \u2014 large or small, rich or poor, near or far \u2014 should be allowed to interfere in our sovereign affairs or intervene in matters properly resident in our domestic jurisdiction. Without strict adherence to those tenets, small States\u2019 existence dangles  precariously on the threads of great-Power intrigue or changing\nperceptions of our strategic significance. Without those principles, our international order reverts to barbarism, in which the strong are doing what they can and the weak merely suffering what they must. That is unacceptable.\nBecause of our undeniable reliance on that cornerstone of international law, small States are among its staunchest defenders. Every violation of the principle of non-intervention, wherever it may occur, is an indirect assault on our own survival. That principle is immutable, and no amount of heavy-handed coercion or ham-fisted inducements will cause us to abandon our overarching existential interests in pursuit of short- term appeasement. Our shared history of struggle against colonial oppression and exploitation informs not only our continuing pursuit of reparative justice for the victims of native genocide and slavery, but places us in implacable opposition to any actions by those who seek illegally to impose their will on independent nations and peoples.\nAs such, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines stands firmly against the continued interventionist assaults on the sovereignty of our neighbours in the Republic of Cuba and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The anachronistic economic blockade of Cuba is both illegal and unproductive. The time has long since passed for its complete repeal. We regret deeply that the fledgling rapprochement between the United States and Cuba has stalled, and we call for a resumption of mutually respectful dialogue between our two friends.\nIn Venezuela, the democratically elected Government has been subjected to an unacceptable, coordinated and intense external economic assault that indirectly has also had a debilitating effect on small Caribbean nations, which have had generous arrangements of solidarity, through the PetroCaribe agreements, for example. To be sure, Venezuela has enormous internal sociopolitical challenges, but unwarranted and illegal intervention is certainly counterproductive to the people\u2019s ongoing quest for peace, democracy and liberty. Venezuela needs a peace and reconciliation mission, not a campaign of sanctions, subversion  and  threats of armed intervention. Constructive dialogue between and among the contending parties and personalities is urgently required.\nThe peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean have repeatedly reaffirmed that our region is a zone of peace. Our peoples are not the pawns and playthings of any nation. Our America and our Caribbean defiantly\n \naffirm that. It is a noise in  our  blood,  an  echo  in our bones.\nNo international organization is better suited than the United Nations to fulfilling its foundational Charter mandate of achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian nature. Today, climate change is indisputably the defining, multifaceted existential problem that we are collectively  confronting. However, the prospects for an effective international solution to climate change are rapidly receding. Our carefully calibrated  climate  accords  are  teetering  on the brink of irrelevance, wounded not only by high-profile withdrawals but also by cynical and foolhardy non-compliance with voluntary mitigation pledges that major emitters have loudly declared but quietly disregarded.\nThe result of this ignoble hand-wringing and political procrastination is that the world continues to burn while its leaders fiddle. In the space of three years, our sister island of Dominica was twice devastated, by Tropical Storm Erika and Hurricane Irma, with Tropical Storm Isaac striking that island a glancing blow only weeks ago. As I speak, the threat of a storm hangs over my country. Beyond the headlines, the story of climate change is grimly told in daily experiences of floods, droughts, landslides, coastal erosion and lost lives and livelihoods across our region.\nWe can wait no longer. The constellation of challenges, externally caused, that faces our small States demands a focused global response that recognizes an undoubted small State exceptionalism in theory and in practice. The many-sided concept of small State exceptionalism ought to be placed at the centre of global discourse in order to prompt appropriate collective action.\nThe rising seas and intensifying storms pose an existential threat to small island developing States in particular. Major emitters that fail to set and honour ambitious mitigation pledges are committing a direct act of hostility against small island developing States, and we ought to resist their recklessness in acting against our interests.\nSimilarly, the financing of climate resilience and adaptation measures by our development partners cannot be shoehorned into the same glacially slow, labyrinthine bureaucratic processes that have stymied other cooperation initiatives. Our friends and partners\nmust recognize the fierce urgency of that unfamiliar and unprecedented climate threat and take decisive political and development action to arrest this extraordinary existential problem. Climate change cannot be handled by business-as-usual practices, however tried and true. Our global climate accords have birthed entities with the ostensible objectives of funnelling and delivering urgently needed mitigation and adaptation financing to the most vulnerable States. However, those entities place the promised support at the centre of an impenetrable web of unwieldy rules and processes that serve only to frustrate those most desperately in need of life-saving cooperation.\nSimilarly, the international commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals falters on the paucity of tangible global effort to ensure their achievement and timeline. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,  the Sustainable Development Goals have been adopted and embedded within our national development plans. Despite limited resources, we have created both a zero-hunger trust fund and a disaster contingency fund, innovative and unique responses to our own sustainable development needs. We have mainstreamed and prioritized goals related to clean energy, economic growth, sustainability, climate action and biodiversity. We have chalked up home-grown progress in tandem with the selfless solidarity of some of our regional and global friends and allies, but much more must be done.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to seek new avenues for  people-centred  development and economic growth amid rapidly changing realities. The spectre of trade wars poses  an  immense threat  to our development aspirations, as does the continual tightening of the procedural noose around the  throat of our banking and financial-services industries. The prospect of de-risking and the loss of correspondent banking relationships is not an individual banking or business decision but a clear and present threat to the economic viability of many small States. The modern manipulation of States\u2019 access to global banking and finance mechanisms, whether informed by politics, stigma or indifference, is a flagrant violation of the internationally recognized right  to  development.  It  is imperialism of a most insidious kind, imposed facelessly from a distance. The United Nations must urgently confront that grave and gathering menace in a coordinated and action-oriented manner.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is also making increasingly innovative forays into capitalizing on\n \nthe vast potential of the blue economy, tourism, niche agricultural products and our historical knowledge in the medical cannabis industry. We seek the cooperation of our friends and partners in supporting such initiatives.\nThe faith of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the principles and potential of the United Nations is manifest in its active participation in all aspects of  this organ. In recent years, we have demonstrated that small size is no impediment to impactful contributions on the world stage. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has played a leadership role in the post-financial crisis response of the United Nations, the revitalization of the General Assembly, Security Council reform, the advancement of the law of the sea, small-arms control, ambitious measures to combat climate change and the global response to non-communicable diseases. Most recently, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  chaired the Administrative and Budgetary Committee of the United Nations and currently serves as President of the Economic and Social Council.\nIn a similar manner, we feel the responsibility to bring our unique perspectives to bear on the work of the Security Council. The perspectives of small States, including small island developing States, have been historically the least heard in the Security Council. As threats to international peace and security have evolved in diverse ways, so too has the need increased for a diversity of viewpoints on the Security Council. Small island States have largely and spectacularly solved the challenge of forging peaceful, harmonious societies amid many of the social, ethnic, political, historical and cultural fissures that traditionally lie at the root of many breaches of international peace and security. We have confronted those challenges not with a surfeit of weapons or dollars, but with mutual respect, dialogue and an understanding that unique situations require not static ideological solutions, but flexibility and innovation geared towards the specificities of the issue at hand.\nThe need for more of that type of practical, principled pragmatism on the Security Council is self- evident. It is why the candidacy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has been endorsed by the States members of the Caribbean Community and why Saint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to call for reform of the membership of the Security Council to reflect modern realities and challenges.\nOur pragmatism affords us the opportunity  to  see the world as it is, unencumbered by historical or ideological blinders. The United Nations, which justly counts States with populations as small as 10,000 people among its Members, somehow continues to remain blind to the 23 million residents of Taiwan. There is simply no principled basis to deny Taiwan the right to participate in the work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations.\nThe relevance  of  this  institution  is  rooted  in  its responsiveness to the  needs  and  challenges  of  the peoples we collectively represent. We can  and must do more to address those needs in direct and transformative ways. We must ever more diligently work to match noble intent with decisive action in pursuit of our Charter objectives. Accordingly, we urge the practical resolution of the pain and suffering of the Palestinians, the people of Yemen and those afflicted by the evil of terrorism, whether State-sponsored or not. Similarly, the madness of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the threat of their use is a standing affront to humanity, peace and security, and therefore demands our continued collective response. Our international agenda for corrective action also includes trafficking in persons, illegal drugs and small arms, refugees from ravaged lands, violence against women and children, the growing scarcity of water and food in many nations, the war against chronic non-communicable diseases, the rising tide of religious intolerance in certain places and the reunification of families arising from abductions of yesteryear.\nWe live amid frantic attempts in diverse quarters to rekindle the dying embers of xenophobia and\n \nunilateralism in pursuit of a past glory stuffed with mythology. But this noble institution is the keeper of   a different flame. Our bedrock principles stand as an open rebuke to those who traffic in base triumphalism and pursue actions that are fueled by both short memories and short-sightedness. Ours is a flame of respect for sovereignty, diversity of views, dialogue, peace and development. In changing times, and amid new challenges, the principles that fuel that flame must be zealously defended. As keepers of that flame and as holders of those principles in trust for future generations, we cannot falter and  be  found  wanting in the face of reactionary assaults. Another way is possible, and that way, that path, is lit by the timeless principles that continue to animate and invigorate the best efforts of the United Nations. Long may those principles continue to guide our collective journey of peace, prosperity and people-centred development.\nWhat, then, is required of us? The answer is as timeless as it is wise. What is required of is to do justly, to love mercy and to work humbly with our God.\n"

        "file_text": "I am once again pleased to be speaking from this rostrum, as I have for several years. I would first like to pay tribute to a worthy son of the African continent, the late Mr. Kofi Annan, who passed on just a few weeks ago, having bequeathed to our Organization a legacy of exemplary commitment in the service of peace. I would also like to salute the unquestionable leadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in defending a strong multilateralism buttressed by a reformed United Nations. I also extend my warmest and most sincere congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its current session on her election, a clear recognition of her experience as a diplomat.\nDuring my address to the Assembly at its seventy- second session (see A/72/PV.19), I outlined the internal situation in my country from the security point of view, affirming that thanks to the efforts that have been made, we had succeeded in reversing dangerous trends in the central Democratic Republic of the Congo and significantly improving the situation there, while the outstanding efforts of our defence and security forces in the north-east had enabled us to contain terrorist attacks. Today peace has been consolidated  in the centre of the country, demonstrated by how far we have come in reintegrating the families that the deplorable violence had forcibly displaced towards the interior or forced into neighbouring countries.\nHowever, the security challenge in the north-east remains unresolved because of persistent terrorist activities that not only affected the  area of  Beni on  23 September, but have also been a problem for other countries in the region. In any case, those attacks, which constitute a further challenge to all who are committed to the defence of a free world without mindless violence, will not prevent us from continuing to work for peace and stability for our country and, above all, for the security of the electoral process currently under way.\nAt the political level,  I  commended  the  efforts of the entire political spectrum in the form of a\ncomprehensive consensus on the electoral process with the ultimate goal of organizing elections. I also mentioned the progress that has been made in particular in creating a voting register and ensuring the imminent publication of the electoral timetable. Despite the enormous challenges that still plague the electoral process at every level, I can now reaffirm, as I did last year, that the timetable for the holding of elections is irreversibly scheduled for the end of this year. The political situation in my country is therefore becoming clearer, with all the electoral timetable deadlines kept so far. Everything will be done to ensure the peaceful and credible nature of the elections, which is evidence of the strengthening of the political and economic stability that the Democratic Republic of the Congo so greatly needs for its emergence from crisis.\n\u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d is the theme of this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly. That suggests an uncompromising view of what we want for our Organization and urges every Member  State  to value its contribution to improving the universal collective. It also urges them to protect the values that make the United Nations a bulwark of solidarity, peace and shared progress in the face of the profound changes that have taken place in the international scene and that have been marked by the emergence of new development hubs and the appearance of new threats, some of which have global repercussions. That once again reinforces the value of shared and engaged reflection on the reform of our Organization with a view to ensuring its improved functioning. However, the effectiveness of our Organization in that new context also depends on its ability to preserve the ideals on which the structure of global equilibrium that emerged in San Francisco more than 70 years ago are based.\nWe will not be able to make the United Nations an organization for all if we tolerate or allow to become commonplace some Governments\u2019 serious interference in matters that clearly fall within the purview of domestic State policy, in violation of the rules that govern our Organization, which represents a grave danger. That is why my country denounces and opposes any interference in the current electoral process, and is determined to finance all of its operational costs. We also demand a return to the fundamentals of democracy and human rights, one of the issues at the root of the asymmetrical diplomacy that some make excessive\n \nuse of to consciously weaken countries that have resolutely taken a path towards progress.  Although the Democratic Republic of the Congo is only 58 years old, and its democracy only 15 years old, we are proud today to  share our experience in that area, both  in  the Human Rights Council and in other regional and international forums. We do it with humility and in a straightforward manner, bearing in mind that the road ahead is still long.\nLastly, we cannot make the United Nations an organization relevant for all people, with a view to achieving sustainable societies, as long as the fauna and flora of countries with extensive forestlands serve only as ornaments \u2014 under the well-chosen pretext that they are the lungs of humankind or the repairers of the environmental damage caused by Northern industries \u2014 and if there is no real will to allocate substantial rewards for those resources to our populations, or to make good on commitments that are often made but never kept.\nAlmost 15 years ago, the African continent spoke with one voice in asking that Africa be represented by a permanent member in the Security Council, as part of United Nations reform. Given the myriad changes over many years and for the sake of equity, which is the focus of our meeting here, it is Africa\u2019s wish to speak with a louder voice in line with the expectations of its peoples, who demand greater representation within this Organization, which embodies universalism and whose peacekeeping activities primarily concern our continent. Moreover, United Nations forces were  deployed  in my country 20 years ago, and my Government now reiterates its demand, given the fact that the results    at the operational level of the multilateral forces have diminished, that the multilateral force effectively and significantly begin its withdrawal.\nIn conclusion, I want to stress the progress made by my country today. Only a few years ago it was mired in bankruptcy, but it is now showing indisputable signs of new ambitions, underscored by encouraging economic and security policies. Our challenges are by no means negligible, but that in no way shakes my faith in a bright future for my country, in which the people understand how  to overcome their history and robustly commit  to their unity, independence and sovereignty. I would also like to assure the Assembly that the Democratic Republic of the Congo will always stand by the Organization as long as it remains at our side, as the United Nations embodies in the most concrete terms what our collective efforts can achieve in bringing about peace and the well-being of our planet. It is nevertheless up to Member States to work  to achieve  a stronger Organization by preserving through their actions the values that inspired its foundation and are unequivocally aimed at the preservation of humankind."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I would like to congratulate Her Excellency Mar\u00eda Fernanda\n \nEspinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session and to wish her fruitful work. Her long experience, both as Ecuador\u2019s Ambassador to  the  United  Nations  and  as Minister for Foreign Affairs, as well as her deep knowledge of the Organization, are valuable resources for the United Nations.\nThe Republic of San Marino, which this year has taken on the role of Vice-President of the General Assembly, supports the priorities of the President\u2019s agenda, as set out in her inaugural statement (see A/73/ PV.1), and believes that they provide  an  important and fundamental impetus to the necessary reforms concerning the most important areas of the United Nations activity. The San Marino delegation assures the President of its fullest collaboration throughout the work of the General Assembly.\nI would also like to express my country\u2019s gratitude to the outgoing President, His Excellency Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for the important work he carried out during the seventy-second session.\nMy country would also like to extend its special thanks to Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his energy and determination in leading the United Nations and the reform processes of the Organization.\nThe theme chosen for this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, is undoubtedly of great relevance. It gives Member States the opportunity to contribute constructively to the work of the General Assembly. There is a strong correlation between the two concepts that make up the subject of the debate: on the one hand, while the United Nations must be closer to the people of the world by translating the fundamental principles of its global action into concrete results, it is essential, on the other hand, not only to defend, but also to strengthen international cooperation and our Organization.\nRecent developments in the global sociopolitical landscape have created obstacles to the development  of multilateralism and are putting it at risk. Today, considering the magnitude of global challenges, their increasingly evident interrelationships and the need for Member States to work together to overcome difficulties, it is more and more essential to adopt an approach based on common and coordinated policies, in one word, multilateralism.\nThe Republic of San Marino has taken the decision to cooperate within the framework of international structures and mechanisms, at the top of which is undoubtedly the United Nations, because it  believes in the strength of dialogue, democracy  and  respect for others. Indeed, the very peaceful coexistence of peoples relies on such values. My country believes that the United Nations must increase its leadership role   in the management of global governance, given to its deeply democratic nature, its universal participation and undisputed legitimacy. The cultural  diversity  and traditions represented within the United Nations are not an obstacle, but rather an enormous asset, which makes it possible to adopt an approach that reconciles the interests of the international community and contributes to the attainment of human and sustainable development.\nWe cannot ignore the fact that in recent years other forums, such as the Group of Twenty, have been and are now exerting a great influence at the global level in the management of global governance. San Marino is grateful to those informal groups for the role that they have played. However, in their decision-making process, those groups should be more transparent and inclusive and should take into account the interests, concerns and aspirations of the countries that are excluded, in particular the interests of developing countries. The action of those informal groups must not be in competition with, but should be complementary to that of the United Nations.  Trust,  inclusiveness  and dialogue are essential elements in the support of multilateralism and its ability to produce concrete results at the global level.\nThis year\u2019s theme is inevitably linked to the United Nations reform process. That process is of fundamental importance for the future world balance needed to ensure international peace and security and must remain at the centre of all our efforts. The reforms must make the structures of the Organization functional for the objectives that it has set for its global action. The credibility and authoritativeness of the United Nations depend on its ability to transform objectives into concrete actions that have a real and measurable impact on peoples\u2019 lives. The United Nations must be closer to the people of the world, communicate better and show them the importance and effectiveness of multilateral collaboration for the lives of all citizens.\nIn that regard, the Republic of San Marino reiterates its support for the reform agenda that Secretary-General\n \nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres is implementing in the fields of peace and security and management and in the United Nations development system. We are confident that those reforms will improve the United Nations contribution to sustainable development, ensure greater effectiveness in the resolution of armed conflicts and the search for sustainable peace, and ultimately strengthen the United Nations system\u2019s ability to produce more concrete and visible results.\nThe Republic of San Marino expresses its concern about the increasing number of conflicts in  many parts of the world and supports the coordinated action of the United Nations in the fields of peacebuilding and peacekeeping. Religious radicalism, terrorism, transnational organized crime, trafficking in drugs and human beings, weapons of mass destruction, violent extremism, marginalization and exclusion all pose a threat to international peace and security.\nIt is essential to analyse the root causes of conflicts if we want to promote disarmament and de-radicalization. At the same time, we need to encourage, through education, respect for and the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and access to justice.\nThe United Nations has often been criticized in recent years for the inability of the Security Council to intervene adequately in various conflict situations, in particular in Syria. Unfortunately, that has undermined the credibility of our Organization. The Republic of San Marino hopes that the Security Council will soon be able to fulfil its mandate effectively. In that regard, and in order to support rapid and decisive action by  the Security Council, I am pleased to recall that my country has joined the code of conduct drawn up by the Accountability, Coherence, Transparency  group to refrain from using the veto in cases of crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. San Marino has also joined the joint proposal by France and Mexico for voluntary suspension of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council.\nIn pursuing the goals of peacemaking and sustainable peace, the United Nations must promote a strategic partnership in which Governments, the United Nations system, international, regional and subregional organizations, civil society, the private sector and universities work together to achieve common goals. The relationship between peace and development is clear: there can be no sustainable development without peace, just as there can be no peace without sustainable\ndevelopment. In that regard, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development becomes essential for the construction of inclusive, resilient and peaceful societies.\nThree years have passed since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda. The international community is working hard to make the Sustainable Development Goals become a reality. While progress has been made in  the implementation of some of the Goals and targets,  it should be noted that there are strong inequalities in the implementation of the Agenda not only between countries, but also within them. The Republic of San Marino underlines the central role played by the High- level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, thanks to its follow-up activity. In that context, San Marino supports the ministerial declaration that was adopted this year by the Forum.\nThe most difficult and important challenge to the achievement of the objective of sustainable development is the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, in particular extreme poverty. Although the level of extreme poverty has fallen significantly in the past 10 years, as shown by the data contained in the report of the Secretary-General on progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (E/2018/64), poverty remains, nevertheless, the main cause of hunger, and the number of undernourished people reached 815 million in 2016.\nThe Agenda emphasizes universal respect for human rights and human dignity and the fact that peace, justice, equality and non-discrimination are fundamental rights whose implementation becomes essential for the construction of inclusive societies.\nThe principle according to which no one should be left behind requires the adoption of specific measures to support people in vulnerable situations. The 2030 Agenda takes into account the needs of children, young people, people with disabilities, the elderly, indigenous people, refugees, displaced persons, migrants and people living in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies or in situations of armed conflict. Equal opportunities and respect for cultural and ethnic diversity are central to the full realization of human potential.\nThe promotion of actions in support of children and young people is a key element, since they must grow up free from all forms of abuse and exploitation. Unfortunately, children pay a very high price in areas of\n \narmed conflict; many lose their lives or are kidnapped, raped, used as shields or recruited as soldiers. Moreover, their schools are often destroyed, as are their hospitals, depriving them of their fundamental rights.\nMy country, which is a member of the Group of Friends on Children and Armed Conflict, believes that international humanitarian laws and human rights laws must be respected in conflict situations. San Marino has ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts, and it supports the Paris Commitments. Moreover, this year San Marino added its name to the list of countries supporting the Safe Schools Declaration, which is an important tool for the protection of educational facilities from military use during conflicts.\nOnly with  the  effective  and  full  participation  of women in decision-making processes that have a direct impact on their lives will it be possible to build sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies. The Republic of San Marino reaffirms its commitment to the fight against all forms of gender-based  violence, as well as all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation. The objective of gender equality, the emancipation of women and girls, and the full realization of their human rights must be achieved. Gender equality must also be translated into equality in educational opportunities, with particular regard to scientific subjects, because technology, science  and  innovation  in  general  play a vital role in meeting global challenges and in the promotion of sustainable development.\nAt the same time \u2014 and the Republic of San Marino is particularly convinced of this \u2014 the idea that sustainable development can be achieved through new technologies, science and innovation must be transmitted through means  of  communication  that do not distort the truth, so as not to undermine the very concept of freedom. In that regard, the Republic of San Marino is offering a concrete and motivated contribution, also at the international level, on the theme of correct information with the objective of combating the increasingly  dangerous  phenomenon of fake news, which are deceptive, uncontrolled and capable of inciting hatred and nurturing prejudices.\nThe commitment of the international community must be directed towards all vulnerable groups without exception. People with disabilities and the elderly, for\nexample, must be ensured full participation in social, economic and cultural life.\nThe effects of climate change represent  one  of the greatest challenges of our time because of their unprecedented impact on our lives and, in particular, on the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable. With an average temperature rise of 1.1\u00b0 C above pre-industrial levels, 2017 was one of the hottest three years of all time. The effects of climate change do not respect national borders. They spread everywhere, in every country and continent. They are increasingly damaging national economies, communities and countries. That is a global problem  that requires solutions  that need to be coordinated globally. Moreover, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation in order to help developing countries move towards a low-emission economy.\nThe Republic of San Marino recognizes the deep synergy between the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda and welcomes the recent entry into force of the agreement. Events related to climate change, such as drought, which generates food and water shortages, have increased competition for access to those and other natural resources. Conflicts are a major cause of food insecurity. As a result, about 74 million people today are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.\nThe number of conflicts has increased over the past decade and has led to the displacement of millions of people. In 2017, 68 million people were forced to leave their homes. In addition to persecution and armed conflicts, natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes, partly resulting from the effects of climate change, have forced millions of people to seek refuge in other countries. Other disasters, such as socioeconomic deprivation and the lack of food, water, education and health, have led millions of people to seek their fortune elsewhere. All of that has contributed to an increase in migratory flows, which is a major challenge that the international community has been facing for some years.\nSan Marino has followed the intergovernmental negotiations that led, at the end of July, to the finalization of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which will be formally adopted in December during the intergovernmental conference on the topic in Morocco. Given its transnational nature, no country can address the migration phenomenon on\n \nits own. The compact strengthens the universality of human rights, including the rights of migrants, their dignity, regardless of their status, and their entitlement to the satisfaction of basic rights, and their protection. Its objective is not  to stop migration, but  to manage   it in the best possible way through strengthened international cooperation. My country believes that the implementation of the compact will bring greater security, order and economic progress for the benefit of all.\nThe global compact is a clear example of what multilateralism can do and shows its potential and importance, in similar fashion as do the recent 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Indeed, through tangible measures aimed at financing development, the compact lays the foundations for a global plan of action.\nIn order to deal with today\u2019s global  challenges,  we need a renewed commitment to multilateralism. That is possible only through a strong United Nations Organization, capable of coordinating, in an effective way, our economic, environmental and social policies at the global, regional and local levels.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the strong support of the Republic of San Marino for all initiatives aimed at implementing the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great joy and personal satisfaction for me to see a woman presiding over the General Assembly. This is the tenth time that I have had the honour to speak in this historic Hall, and it is the first time in all those years that a woman has held the highest office here at  the General Assembly.  I salute her leadership, and we  will support her.  But  it is also disappointing to see that the United Nations, which should be a trailblazer on the path of women\u2019s empowerment, so frequently misses opportunities to make appointments that resonate outside this building. I am therefore all the more grateful to Secretary-General Guterres for his commitment to gender parity. His resolve has illustrated that that goal can be achieved relatively quickly. We have yet to realize full gender equality in practice back home in Liechtenstein, and we will continue to look to the United Nations to set examples that guide us on our own path.\nThe United Nations is the most important peace project the world has ever seen. It has shaped the way we have lived together for more than seven decades. It was created out of the belief that the world could not afford another armed confrontation between its most powerful States, with its devastating consequences for everybody. It was created on the basis of a collective system for the maintenance of international peace and security, based on common values and common purposes.\nThe early years of the work of the United Nations illustrated the enthusiasm with which States seized the opportunity they had created for themselves. There was a strong focus on the most painful open wounds caused by the Second World War. The true dimensions of the horror of the Holocaust gradually became public knowledge, not least through the trials in Nuremberg, and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was adopted as a result. Influenced by the vivid impressions of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in its very first resolution (resolution 1(I)) the General Assembly set a goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons. We are still far from achieving it, and the path so far has been rough. But we have finally charted a way forward by adopting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons last year. I congratulate the 19 countries that have already ratified the Treaty, and we will do our best to follow suit.\nThe United Nations has also been a place where we have developed human rights standards, the rules that guide the relationship between the State and the human person, individually and collectively. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights began that inspiring trajectory. Eleanor Roosevelt, one of my personal role models, made a decisive contribution to its conclusion. Seventy years later, there can be no question that every individual on this planet is entitled to enjoy all the rights reflected in the Declaration. An impressive number of groundbreaking treaties have been built on its foundations, a very proud record. More than any other, the area of human rights reflects the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, written on behalf of the peoples, not their Governments.\nDevelopment became another key mission in this building. In fact, for many of its Members, the United\n \nNations is the world\u2019s most important  platform  in that respect. That is also an agenda that we shaped together. We agreed on the right to development and made it clear that development, human rights and peace and security belong together. That effort has been crowned by the Sustainable Development Goals, which will guide our work until 2030. They offer a historic opportunity, and we owe it to our children not to miss it.\nThe challenge of climate change is a perfect illustration of the indispensability of the United Nations. We ourselves have created a threat to our sheer existence as the human race and as individuals. The threat knows no national borders and makes no distinctions. We are all equally affected, and we can only overcome it together. Our very survival is at stake, and yet we are significantly behind in terms of what must be done. The Secretary-General is right to sound the alarm. That is one of his responsibilities. It is up to us, all of us, to act.\nAll of this can lead to only one conclusion. We need more of the United Nations, not less. We need a United Nations that is more effective, cooperative and dynamic, more in tune with the times we live in, and yet our efforts have been distracted. We see tendencies to revert to a paradigm that resulted in enormous suffering in the past and would certainly be disastrous today. Wilful blindness, a disregard for realities, denial of the facts and appeals to fear and resentment are recipes for disaster. We have witnessed a downward spiral in that conversation. It has been rapid and today has led us to a point where the fundamentals of what we have created together are under attack.\nThe Charter is our main reference point as we reflect on the most pressing challenges of the day. One paragraph from the Preamble stands out this year:\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations determined ... to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained\u201d.\nToday more than ever we are challenged in our determination to do just that. Today we can no longer take it for granted that those conditions exist. The questioning of international agreements  and  norms in the areas of trade, climate change, disarmament, migration and human rights has one common thread. It not only undermines the contents of those agreements, it is an attack on the rules-based order as such. It runs\ncontrary to the pledge that we are all committed to under the Charter, that is, to respecting our obligations under international law.\nIn the course of this debate, speakers have expressed their overwhelming support for the international rules- based order. That gives us hope and inspiration to tackle the challenges we are facing. Let us be clear.  We have to work harder to make the United Nations fit for purpose. Most worryingly, we still have a Security Council that is least functional when it is most needed. While addressing our weaknesses, we must also make better use of our strengths, particularly the power of the Assembly. It has the legal and political authority to build institutions and set policies that are game-changers.\nOne such institution is the  International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. We were proud to lead the way in its creation two years ago. Born out of frustration over a deadlock in the Security Council, it has quickly become a symbol of what the Assembly can achieve and a beacon of hope for Syria. At this critical moment in the Syrian conflict, our resolve to ensure accountability for the crimes committed will shape the country\u2019s future.\nWe are confronted by a very different situation, with a similar massive accountability challenge, in the atrocities committed against the Rohingya population by the authorities in Myanmar, which are shocking to all of us. There can be no voluntary return for the hundreds of thousands forcibly displaced into Bangladesh unless we can ensure a credible accountability process. We now have a direct path to justice, because the International Criminal Court (ICC) has ruled that it can exercise jurisdiction over the crime of forced deportation. That creates a new and expeditious policy option for the 123 States among us that have joined the Rome Statute, in that we can now come together and refer the situation in Cox\u2019s Bazar to the ICC. I hope that conversation will take place here in New York over the next few weeks.\nFrom Syria to Myanmar to Venezuela, the International Criminal Court is at the centre of the effort to fight impunity. Its creation 20 years ago was perhaps the most important advance in the recent history of international law. It fulfilled a vision that had eluded us for a century. Today it is an institution that is imperfect but, more importantly, indispensable.\n \nIt is a telling fact that at a time when there seems to be a general questioning of the rules-based order, the ICC finds itself under particular attack from various sides. We need that Court more than ever, and more than ever, we must be ready to stand up for it.\nThe issue of modern slavery and human trafficking is particularly disturbing to the Liechtenstein Government. Seventy years ago, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we agreed that no one should be held in slavery or servitude. Today more than\n40 million people, predominantly women and girls, live in such conditions. That is unacceptable. We have joined forces with our partners from Australia and the United Nations University and created the Financial Sector Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. Its task is to design a response so that actors in the financial sector can help eliminate modern slavery and ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. I am proud to serve as its co-convener, together with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. We are under no illusions about the magnitude of the task, but we are encouraged that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has created such a strong impetus for finally eliminating slavery, and we stand ready to take that opportunity, together with everyone here.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the delegation of  the Bolivarian Republic of  Venezuela, I  would like  to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, the first Latin American woman to assume that position.\nWe have been convened to work on and address at this session the important and crucial theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. Making the United Nations relevant to all is indeed a noble and lofty objective, which the United Nations system must pursue at the dawn of the twenty-first century, a century of great opportunities that we firmly believe will set the tone for the processes of human, political and popular liberation that will have a significant impact on the future of the Organization sooner rather than later.\nThe United Nations was born in 1945, in the heat of the end of the so-called Second World War. The way it was organized throughout the rest of the twentieth century was a reflection of the post-war conflicts and action of those years in a bipolar and \u2014 after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s \u2014 a unipolar world. The correlation of forces and the functioning of the world have always directly influenced the United Nations and, in order for it to be relevant, in accordance with the objective of the seventy-third session of the General Assembly, it must express the desires, the way of being, the culture, the political thought, the strength and the hopes of the majority of the peoples of the world.\nThat is why Venezuela has come here today \u2014 to speak its truth. I bring to  the  Assembly  the  truth of a fighting, heroic and revolutionary people.  I  speak on behalf of a homeland that, throughout its history, has refused to surrender to injustice or to the empires that yesterday were made up of slave owners and colonialists and that today are still made up of slave owners \u2014 neocolonialist slave owners. I speak on behalf of a historic people who rose up in a heroic resistance to support indigenous and native peoples who for centuries resisted domination by the colonial empires of the past. I speak on behalf of the country that has the honour to be the birthplace of the great liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the outstanding leader of the generation of liberators of the Americas, who 200 years ago achieved the heroic feat of founding a continent and a region and of realizing a dream \u2014 that of independent republics in this region of the world.\nVenezuela is a historic place. It is both a birthplace and a school of republican values, a birthplace and school of rebellion, a birthplace and a school for dignity and for the values such as equality on which our homeland has stubbornly insisted  in  its  search for its independence and sovereignty throughout the centuries. That is the voice I bring to this Hall, which has been the backdrop for one of the most infamous and shameful assaults we have seen in recent years.\nOur country has been harassed and assaulted. Yesterday, in this very Hall, the President of the United States of America once again attacked the noble people of Venezuela (see A/73/PV.6), invoking the doctrine that established the United States empire 200 years ago and determined its interventionist role, its purported role as judge, plaintiff and policeman of the world \u2014 the Monroe Doctrine. In this very Hall, the President of the most powerful imperial nation in the world, the\n \nUnited States of America, articulated the doctrine of James Monroe, who, in his day, said that America was for  the people of  the United States and that the rest of the Americas must belong to the United States, as its backyard, in the interest of the Washington elites that dominated the way in which that nation, a former colony of the British Empire, was organized. In fact, he took the Monroe Doctrine further yesterday. We may ask why President Donald Trump unleashed such a ferocious expression of American power at every level in his speech yesterday.\nThis is a historic conflict, as we have often told the world. Our people are quite familiar with it.  It  is  a conflict between the imperialist, interventionist, neocolonialist Monroe Doctrine  and the historic republican doctrine of independence, rebellion, dignity, justice, freedom and equality of our liberator, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. It is an old conflict. It is an old confrontation with an imperialist doctrine seeking to dominate our region. In the nineteenth century, it was our region alone that they wanted to dominate. In the twentieth century, they were already planning to  dominate the  world.  In the twenty-first century, they intend to continue dominating, directing, blackmailing and giving orders to the world as if it were their own property.\nIn our region this is a 200-year-old conflict and confrontation between  the  republican  libertarian flag \u2014 which in the nineteenth century of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and the liberators advocated a world of balance and respect \u2014 and the pro-imperialist, interventionist flags promoting the domination of an  entire  region by an elite that had already taken control of power in Washington. It is an old, historic conflict, with which we are very familiar. Today Venezuela is  the  victim of ongoing aggression on the economic, political and diplomatic fronts \u2014 and in the media \u2014 by those who govern the United States of America. It uses the Monroe Doctrine to justify from an ideological, political and diplomatic point of view the aggression against our beloved homeland, our very raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\nWhat is the reason for that political, economic and diplomatic aggression against Venezuela? First of all, it is because Venezuela has carried out an independent project of democratic revolution and social redemption and has built its own new social model, founded on our country\u2019s historical roots, identity and the very culture of our Latin American region. For 20 years, they have tried to stop the course of history, development and a\nrevolutionary project that was born from the very roots of the struggles of our people and our region.\nSecondly \u2014 and this is perhaps more understandable \u2014 it is for global geopolitical reasons. Venezuela has the largest  internationally  certified  oil reserve in the world. Venezuela, a founder of the Organization   of   Petroleum   Exporting   Countries, a country that has been producing oil for 100 years, discovered and internationally certified the world\u2019s largest oil reserve. Venezuela also possesses significant natural and mining resources. Today, our country is pursuing the certification of what could be the world\u2019s largest gold reserve, based on international standards. The world should know that, in addition to the largest international oil reserve, Venezuela is in the process of having its gold reserve certified as the largest in the world, based on international standards. We are also in the process of certifying what will be the fourth-largest gas reserve in the world. These are significant natural resources in an important geopolitical, economic and strategic location, which has led the oligarchies on our continent and those who dominate from Washington to consider taking over and controlling Venezuela\u2019s political power.\nToday Venezuela is also the victim of ongoing economic aggression. In the past two years it has been subjected to a series of unilateral, illegal measures of economic persecution and blockade. We have been prevented from using the dollar, the international currency, on the authority of the United States Secretary of the Treasury. Today Venezuela cannot  negotiate any international transaction using the dollar. Does the world know that Venezuela is being persecuted economically, commercially and monetarily? Today we are subject to a set of illegal, unilateral economic sanction mechanisms. Yesterday, the President of the United States, from this very rostrum, announced new economic and financial so-called sanctions against our country under the cover of law \u2014 international law. Does the United Nations system know that unilateral sanctions that use preferential treatment through currency and financial persecution are illegal under international law?\nVenezuela is also subject to ongoing aggression  in the media. An attempt has been made to build a   file to justify an international intervention. Today we know that plans have been made for an international military intervention to control our country. A case against our country has been constructed in the global\n \nmedia, alleging the existence of a humanitarian crisis and using United Nations concepts to justify permitting a coalition of countries, headed by the Government of the United States and its satellite Governments in Latin America, to get its hands on our country. A migratory crisis has been manufactured in various ways, a crisis that is collapsing under its own weight and that is intended to divert attention from the real migratory crises that exist in the world and demonstrate the degree to which the countries of the South are disadvantaged. The migratory crisis that exists in Central America,  in Mexico and in Latin America was triggered by the announcement of a separation wall against our peoples, a wall dividing our peoples. No one wants to talk about that. It is evidence of the double standards in the treatment of the real situation of Latin American and Caribbean migrants, who are contained and persecuted on the border with Mexico, where families have been separated and children kidnapped, yet where there is no interest in addressing or raising awareness about the issue.\nThere  is  no  interest  in  drawing  attention  to  the seriousness of the migratory crisis caused by NATO\u2019s destruction of Libya, which has led to the migration of thousands, in fact millions, of our African brothers \u2014 and of the war against Syria, which has resulted in the migration of people from the Middle East. Instead, an attempt has been made to focus on  an  alleged migratory  crisis  in  Venezuela  through  a worldwide media campaign to justify  what  has  been announced for several years \u2014 a humanitarian intervention. It is the same kind of plot that was used in the story of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. It is the same kind of plot that justified intervening in other countries but it is now being conducted through a major campaign of brutal psychological warfare.\nToday Venezuela is also the victim of diplomatic aggression. Yesterday, my brothers and sisters of the Governments of the world witnessed as the President of the United States made direct threats to  cut  off  and withdraw aid. We  witnessed  direct  threats  by the Government of the United States to block aid to international support and assistance systems for the Governments and peoples of the world who need it.  We have heard statements from various Governments demanding better mechanisms for access to financing for development, to which our peoples are entitled. The President of the United States yesterday, from this same rostrum, threatened the Governments of the world\nby telling them that they must submit to his designs, obey his orders and cooperate with his policies in the United Nations system  or  suffer  the  consequences. A ferocious diplomatic offensive has been directed against Venezuela in all the organs of the United Nations system, supported by satellite Governments that kneel and sully the honour of the peoples they claim to represent.\nVenezuela has been subjected to continued political aggression. On 8 September, The New York Times published evidence of the participation of White House and United States Government officials in meetings  on how to promote a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and bring about a change of Government, a regime change, in Venezuela. The New York Times investigation, which was picked up by Time magazine, The Washington Post and throughout the world press, is further confirmation of the conspiracy and the ongoing attacks by the Government of the United States against the strong, constitutional democracy \u2014 a people\u2019s democracy \u2014 that is the Venezuelan democracy. We had already repelled, at the time, attempts to carry out violence against our Constitution and to cause riots and attempted military coups against the constitutional and revolutionary Government, over which, thanks to the popular will and vote, I preside in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\nAfter the failure of those apparent attempts to bring about riots and military attacks described in the pages of The New York Times, that newspaper detailed how United States officials, supported by the Colombian Government and institutions, met and offered their encouragement and support to that attempt at regime change. Can the United Nations system, can humankind and \u2014 I say this to my Latin American and Caribbean brothers \u2014 can Latin America and the Caribbean accept such methods, which did so much damage to our region throughout the twentieth century? How many military interventions and coups d\u2019\u00e9tat were there? How many dictatorships were imposed during the long, dark twentieth century in Latin America and the Caribbean? And whom did they favour? The people? Whose interests did they represent? They represented the interests of transnational corporations \u2014 interests contrary to those of our peoples. We had to endure long dictatorships, such as that of Augusto Pinochet  in Chile, because of the determination of the United States elites who believed in the Monroe Doctrine to deny the right that we had earned to govern ourselves\n \nin the way we need to govern ourselves and to build economic, political and cultural systems that were our region\u2019s own.\nThat is why I said that I have come to bring the truth of a people engaged in a struggle. Venezuela is at the centre of a political and media campaign that seems to have no end. That is why we bring the truth of our homeland to the General Assembly.\nAfter the failure of those illegal, unconstitutional and criminal attempts to bring about regime change, published in The New York Times; after the democratic presidential election on 20 May, in which this public servant standing before the Assembly today, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, obtained 68 per cent of the popular votes in free elections \u2014 the presidential election on 20 May was the twenty-fourth election in 19 years, and the Bolivarian revolutionary forces, with varying levels of approval, have won 22 out of 24 elections against  the opposition forces in our country; after the failure of the attempts to carry out military coups d\u2019\u00e9tat; and after the failure of the candidacies and electoral tactics supported by Washington, with the immense electoral triumph that the people gave us, on 4 August, I  was the victim of a terrorist attack by drones that tried to assassinate me in military style on a main street of the capital city of Caracas. If the attack had been executed as planned \u2014 and this is public knowledge \u2014 there would have been a massacre and all of Venezuela\u2019s institutional, political and military leaders would have been killed.\nThat same 4 August, the terrorist perpetrators of the drone attack, the first known global drone attack by terrorists, were captured by our State\u2019s  security and police agencies. All 28 perpetrators were captured through various investigations, and all of them have confessed and been convicted. As has been made public and as various Governments around the world have been informed, all the investigations indicate that the terrorist attack of 4 August was prepared, financed and planned from the territory of the United States of America. Through diplomatic channels, I have made the United States Government aware of the names of the organizers, financiers and planners of the serious terrorist attack of 4 August, and we have given proof of their involvement. All the investigations indicate that the attack and its perpetrators, as they have confessed, were trained and prepared for months on Colombian territory under the protection and support of the Colombian authorities. The latest investigations\nand arrests have revealed, as I have made public, that some diplomatic officials of the Governments of Chile, Colombia and Mexico have been implicated by the perpetrators in efforts to facilitate their escape after the terrorist attack was carried out.\nI want to ask the United Nations system to appoint a special representative of the Secretary-General to conduct an independent international investigation into the implications of the terrorist attack that our country suffered on 4 August and those responsible for it. Venezuela is open \u2014 as are the doors of our country and of our justice system \u2014 to establishing direct responsibility for that aggression, which is the most serious to have taken place in our country\u2019s political history. Through their involvement, they sought to create chaos in our homeland and to leave the entire State leaderless in order to justify national confrontation and internal violence, thereby rationalizing the implementation of mechanisms outside the multilateral system of the United Nations and military intervention, as other countries have experienced in the past.\nVenezuela therefore formally proposes support for an independent international investigation and that the truth about those events be established. Even I have said to the United States Government how good it would  be if the United States Government, which has denied its involvement in preparing and in carrying out those attacks, were to heed my appeal that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, together with high-level professionals and experts, take part in the investigation to clarify and help the Venezuelan justice system to determine the truth, and only the truth.\nWhen I arrived in New York today, in the afternoon, I learned that some journalists had asked President Donald Trump if he was willing to meet Maduro \u2014 as they call me \u2014 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, President of Venezuela. It seems that President Donald Trump said in some of his replies today that if that helped Venezuela, he would be willing to do so. I therefore say and affirm to him from this rostrum that, despite the immense historical, ideological and social differences \u2014  I  am a  worker,  a bus driver, a man of the people, not a tycoon or a billionaire \u2014 despite all the differences, which could be considered immeasurable, I, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, President of Venezuela, would be willing to shake hands with the President of the United States and sit down and discuss our bilateral differences and the issues of our region that have been so talked about. That is what I think.\n \nVenezuela is a nation with a tradition of peace. Venezuela is a friendly country. Venezuelans do not hate the United States. On the contrary, we appreciate the United States, its culture, its arts, its society. But we disagree with the imperialist concepts that have taken hold of political power in Washington since the very founding of the nation.\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was our liberator who wrote, in 1829, almost prophetically: \u201cThe United States seems destined by Providence to plague America with miseries in the name of freedom.\u201d He had prophetic vision. It must have been hard to see so early what would come to pass in the twentieth century. Do President Donald Trump and I have any differences?  Indeed  we  do. But it is those with differences who should enter into dialogue. It is those with differences who must bring their goodwill and their ability to communicate to the table. President Trump has said that he is worried about Venezuela, that he wants to help Venezuela. Well, I am prepared to discuss, with an open agenda, any topic with the American Government with humility, honesty and sincerity.\nAs President of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, Venezuela flies the  flag of  the  dialogue of civilizations. As President of the Non-Aligned Movement, Venezuela will always promote and participate in international political dialogue and understanding as a way to resolve international conflicts. We advocate political and peaceful means rather than force. Venezuela has invaluable experience in organizations such as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in dealing with differences and building consensus and agreement.\nRecently in Algeria, we held a meeting on the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC. It was an extraordinary meeting, attended by the representatives of the Monitoring Committee, of which our country is one, as well as the representatives of 24 States with the largest oil reserves and the biggest producers of oil. Keeping in mind the cultural, political, geostrategic and geopolitical differences, we reached a consensus \u2014 one voice \u2014 in order to continue stabilizing the oil market at fair, reasonable and stable prices.\nWe believe in political dialogue as the way to channel solutions, as the way to resolve conflicts. There have been attempts to demonize the Bolivarian revolution of Venezuela with a brutal campaign never seen before, first against Commander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\nFr\u00edas, founder of our revolution and, in the heart of Venezuelans, eternal Commander, and then against this humble man standing here carrying the voice of a people, who supports his revolution and democratically backs his actions. That is why I reaffirm our will to participate in international dialogue and national political dialogue.\nI know that there  are  Governments  represented in this Hall that are interested in peace, sovereignty, independence and justice in Venezuela. I open our arms to all those who wish to help us from Africa, Europe, Asia and Latin America, while respecting the sovereignty of the country, without intervening in the internal affairs of Venezuela, so that they can support and assist us in a process of  sovereign  dialogue for the peace, democracy, justice, prosperity and future  of Venezuela \u2014 a noble nation that deserves peace, a future and more.\nWe bring good tidings from a country that  has  not surrendered and will not surrender.  We  bring good tidings from a nation that is consolidating its democracy. We bring good tidings from a nation that is empowering its people. We bring good tidings from a country that is building its own social model and its own social welfare State with new ways of protecting its elderly, its retirees, its children, its youth, its women, its most vulnerable sectors and its workers. We bring good tidings about our efforts towards economic recovery. In mid-August, we launched an economic programme to bring about growth and prosperity, which is laying the foundation for a new economy that does not depend on oil revenue, but is, instead, diversified and can grow sustainably and build prosperity. We are on our way to a new type of social model.\nWe believe in a different world. Our generation saw the coming and going of the bipolar world of two blocs and the Cold War \u2014 which some, it seems, wish to bring back with attacks against China, Russia and humble countries like Venezuela. Engaging in combat against countries like Russia and China goes against what should be a humanistic international policy that recognizes the emergence of new centres of power and the need to build a multipolar world.\nVenezuela advocates and is committed to building a multipolar, multicentric world where the various regions \u2014 Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Europe, North America \u2014 can coexist in balance and in peace, while respecting each other\u2019s cultures, religions,\n \nidiosyncrasies, identities and various political and economic models. There is no single economic model. We cannot allow others to impose one particular economic model and way of thinking on us. We cannot allow others to impose a particular cultural or political model on us. Humankind must not all espouse the same uniform way of thought.\nWe demand the cultural, religious and political diversity of humankind in this world.  That  is  why we advocate the emergence of such a world from the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the emergence of a world of justice. We assume and reaffirm our solidarity with the Arab people of Palestine. There must be justice in Palestine and respect for its historical territories, as established in 1967 by the United Nations. We raise the flag of the Palestinian people.\nWe support the call of the United Nations for an end to the infamous and criminal 50-year blockade against the people of Cuba. We have had enough of continuing to apply obsolete methods of another era against Cuba. Those same methods are now being applied against other people, such as the Venezuelan people. We will therefore happily vote in the coming days in favour of the upcoming draft resolution to reject the blockade and economic and financial persecution against Cuba and demand that it be lifted immediately.\nWe have a world to build. We have a world to forge. Two hundred years ago, our region was plagued with colonies, slavery and injustice. One hundred years ago, as a people we strived for freedom. Today, in the twenty-first century, the time for freedom has come \u2014 the opportunity has undoubtedly arisen, from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, from the revolutionary ideas of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and the example and legacy of Commander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, whose voice still echo in this Hall, clamouring for justice in the world, demanding an end to those imperialist practices of threats, coercion and extortion against our peoples.\nToday, we can say that we have lived through 20 years of revolution. The past three years have been the most difficult with harassment, aggression and attacks. We have endured political, media, diplomatic, economic and financial attacks and persecution, and I can say today, on 26 September, that Venezuela is stronger than ever. We have managed to resist and have found strength in our own historical core to still be standing today, victorious and ready to continue building our own social model \u2014 that of the socialist revolution\nof the twenty-first century. We proclaim it to the four winds. It is a new revolution of independence, dignity and justice. Today we are stronger than ever.\nTwo days ago we witnessed the tribute to Nelson Mandela (see A/73/PV.5). To speak of Mandela is to speak of rebellion. Mandela has been portrayed as a fool, as someone who did not fight. Mandela is rebellion in the face of injustice. He is courage and bravery. He is a challenge to the oppressors. We consider ourselves to be following the legacy of Nelson Mandela and of the great African leaders who have raised the banner of equality and justice in the face of slavery, racism and colonialism in all of its forms.\nWe heard the tribute to Nelson Mandela and reflected on how much the world  has changed. Only 30 years ago, Mandela was considered a terrorist by the United States Congress of the North American Government. Just a few years ago, Mandela was still on the terror watch list. Does that not sound familiar? Nelson Mandela was a terrorist, he was sanctioned and persecuted, abandoned. How the world has changed. Today, Nelson Mandela is a flag that we embrace with love and conviction. He is a symbol of what is possible if rebellion, struggle and justice can win the noble hearts and minds of people.\nI have confidence in the future of humankind. I have confidence in the destiny of my country. I have confidence in the common future of this community, the United Nations. After having survived coup d\u2019\u00e9tat attempts and terrorist attacks, I can still say that I  have  confidence in human beings and in the future  of humankind. From Venezuela, we say to the United Nations that we have  confidence in the noble  ideals of a people that, like the people of Venezuela, has not surrendered and will not surrender. The Assembly can count on Venezuela for the great causes of the future of the United Nations and the future of a multipolar world.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me express my sincere gratitude for this opportunity to address the Assembly today from this rostrum.\nI would like to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I would also like to express our gratitude to Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his effective work at the helm of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session.\nToday, the Republic of Uzbekistan has entered an important stage of radical and dynamic transformations. Its goal is to strengthen and further develop a democratic, law-governed State with an open and\n \nsocially oriented market economy and a vibrant civil society, in which the main values are rights, freedoms and the legal interests of individuals. At the initiative of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, we adopted a five-year action strategy aimed at making fundamental changes in the economy, State governance, legal and social spheres, security, and at ensuring inter-ethnic and interconfessional peace and harmony. The principle that the people should not serve State bodies, but rather that State bodies should serve the people has become a cornerstone of the main programme of our democratic reforms.\nElevating the role of the Parliament and political parties, increasing the accountability and transparency of the executive branch, strengthening public institutions and developing civil society have become the practical embodiments of the constitutional principle that the people are the sole source of State power.\nWe are taking significant steps to streamline the national system for the protection of human rights and freedoms and are strengthening the independence of the judicial system. The use of child and forced labour has ceased. The recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Council, treaty bodies, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and its Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief are being systematically implemented.\nWe have also carried  out  large-scale  initiatives to liberalize the economy, create conditions for free entrepreneurship, ensure the inviolability of private property and improve the investment climate. We  have introduced the free convertibility of our national currency, expanded access to bank credit and carried out tax and custom reforms. According to the World Bank report entitled \u201cDoing Business 2018\u201d, Uzbekistan was among the 10 leading countries in terms of creating favourable conditions for doing business. As a result, Uzbekistan today has earned a reputation for being a thoroughly renewed, open and dynamically developing country. The chosen path of resolute reforms is irreversible and enjoys the broad support of the people of the country.\nToday we are witnessing an unprecedented new alignment of power at the global and regional levels.  A rethinking of the principles of international politics and economics, which until recently seemed to be unshakable, is under way. The world is becoming less predictable and unstable. The strength and effectiveness\nof multilateral institutions and mechanisms designed to ensure international security has been put to the test.\nIn that regard, it is crucial to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in international relations, especially in the support of the three pillars of the Organization, namely, peace, the security and sustainable development of countries and regions, and the protection of human rights. Uzbekistan supports the steps taken by the leadership of the United Nations to streamline the governing system of the Organization, and calls for the gradual reform of its bodies, including the Security Council, by taking into account today\u2019s realities and challenges.\nIn addition, we are ready to actively participate in United Nations efforts to promote comprehensive peace, stability and development on the basis of the respect for human rights and freedoms, democratization and the rule of law. In that regard, Uzbekistan has, for the first time, presented its candidacy to the Human Rights Council for the period 2021-2023. We sincerely hope that our achievements in the area of human rights will provide a solid basis for gaining the support of States Members of the United Nations for Uzbekistan\u2019s candidacy.\nWe are also counting on the support of Member States to back the initiative of the President of Uzbekistan aimed at developing and adopting a United Nations convention on the rights of youth and a General Assembly draft resolution on enlightenment and religious tolerance. Those documents would facilitate efforts to effectively counter the threats of terrorism and the ideology of radicalism by tackling the vital socioeconomic problems facing our youth through the provision of better access to high-quality education and enlightenment in the spirit of tolerance, humanism and openness.\nUzbekistan has already begun advancing those initiatives. In June, working with our foreign partners, we held an international conference on the role of youth in confronting religious extremism and terrorism. At the end of the conference, the participants adopted the Samarkand Declaration on Increasing the Role of Youth in Countering Violent Extremism and Radicalization Leading to Terrorism.\nIn 2018, the international community celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In that regard, the President of Uzbekistan has signed a decree on a programme of events dedicated to that occasion. We have adopted a\n \nspecial State programme for promoting the essence and significance of that first universal document on human rights through the streamlining of domestic legislation on human rights and law enforcement and the facilitation of Uzbekistan\u2019s accession to new international treaties. Uzbekistan has also made a voluntary contribution to the budget of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the amount of\n$100,000.\nCurrently, we are also taking an initiative to convene an Asian international forum on human rights on 22 and 23 November 2018 as the final event of our targeted practical actions. The forum will take place in the city of Samarkand, which is, as is attested to by UNESCO, a crossroads of many of the world\u2019s cultures. Central Asia remains a main foreign-policy priority of Uzbekistan. Today, the situation in the region differs from the  one  that  prevailed  not  long  ago.  Thanks to the joint efforts of the countries of the region, we have  created in Central Asia, within a  short period  of time, a fundamentally new political atmosphere, raised the level of political trust and strengthened the traditionally friendly and good-neighbourly relations among ourselves.\nThe important outcome of all that work is the significant progress achieved in resolving such acute issues as the demarcation of borders, the management of water resources and the joint use of transport communications. It should be noted that those very issues had not only remained unresolved for an extended period of time but were also sources of regional tension. The agreements with neighbouring countries have enabled the opening of dozens of checkpoints on the borders of Uzbekistan and liberalized the visa regime. Uzbekistan\u2019s trade turnover with the States of the region increased by 20 per cent in 2017 and by 50 per cent during the first six months of this year.\nIn the near future, at our initiative, Uzbekistan is planning to convene a regional economic forum, which should serve as a permanently functioning platform for representatives of the business community to discuss regional projects in the trade, economic, investment and innovative cooperation fields. The first consultative meeting of the Heads of State of the Central Asian countries, held in March in Astana, became the bright symbol of a new era of regional cooperation. The next forum will take place in March 2019 in Tashkent. Most importantly, we are now more convinced that we are united not only by our joint past, but also by our common\nfuture. The high level of regional interaction in Central Asia is receiving broad international support. In that regard, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our partners and friends who have recently rendered assistance in the preparation and adoption of a historic General Assembly resolution entitled \u201cStrengthening regional and international cooperation to ensure peace, stability and sustainable development in the Central Asian region\u201d (resolution 72/283).\nThere is no doubt that that United Nations resolution acknowledges the formation of Central Asia as a single consolidated region, the countries of which \u2014 and I would like to put special emphasis on this \u2500 are capable through their joint efforts of solving common regional problems and ensuring prosperity, well-being and a worthy future for their population of 70 million people. In order to further deepen  multifaceted  cooperation in our region, Uzbekistan is proposing  to  develop  and adopt a General Assembly draft resolution on developing sustainable tourism in Central Asia, which would facilitate the utilization of the unique tourism potential of the region, through which the great Silk Road stretched in the past, connecting East and West by trade, cultural and civilizational ties. The sustainable development of Central Asia requires the maintenance of the ecological equilibrium of the region, which in turn requires the mitigation of the consequences of the drying-up of the Aral Sea. For the past several years, Uzbekistan has implemented a number of large-scale projects in the Aral Sea zone.\nUzbekistan initiated the establishment of the Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the  Aral Sea Region, which was supported by the United Nations. The President of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, during his address at the seventy-second session of the General Assembly last year (see A/72/ PV.5) and at the recent summit of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, held on 24 August this year in Turkmenistan, again drew attention to that initiative. The establishment, under the auspices of the United Nations, of the Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region is an attempt to highlight major risks that pose threats to the vulnerable population and also opens a new level of dialogue aimed at comprehensive and human-based solutions that focus on the real needs of people, taking into account the existing risks and challenges.\nWe hope for the overall support of the United Nations for this initiative taken by Uzbekistan. When we speak about Central Asia, we cannot but mention Afghanistan \u2014 a country that we consider to be a historical part of the culturo-civilizational space of our region. A stable Afghanistan is a prerequisite for the sustainable development of Central Asia as a whole. Recently, Uzbekistan significantly expanded its bilateral relations with Afghanistan, actively joined multilateral efforts to resolve the Afghan problem and is making a real contribution to restoring the country\u2019s economy, as well as to developing close trade, economic, transport and communication ties. In March, we convened the Tashkent Conference on Afghanistan. As the President of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, stated during his address at the Conference,\n\u201cWe are ready, at any stage of the peace process, to create all necessary conditions for organizing on the territory of Uzbekistan direct negotiations between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban Movement\u201d.\nThe main outcome of the Conference was the unanimous adoption of the Tashkent Declaration. It reinforced a firm consensus, at the regional and global levels, on the necessity of obtaining the earliest possible launch of direct negotiations between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban Movement, without any preliminary conditions. We are  convinced  that the readiness of the contending parties for mutual negotiations in the name of the vital interests of the multinational Afghan people will serve as a  solid basis for advancing the peace process in that country. In Uzbekistan, we recognize that the success of our large-scale programme of democratic transformation, outlined in our current strategy of actions, as well as the success of our foreign policy initiatives, which are aimed at facilitating international peace and stability, will, to a large extent, depend on the support of our friends and partners and the international community as a whole. Uzbekistan is therefore open to a broad international dialogue. We are sincerely interested in Uzbekistan\u2019s further integration into global political and economic arrangements and in developing constructive and mutually beneficial cooperation with all interested countries.\n"

        "file_text": "History  usually defines certain periods by the major  developments and phenomena that occur during that period. If you pose the question as to which development or which phenomenon history will select to identify the current period that we have been living in, then the answer is pretty obvious. The huge migratory waves that we are experiencing globally are how history will  identify our current era. Those huge migratory waves impose  a significant security risk almost everywhere in the world. They have destabilized a number of countries over the past years. They have caused serious political debates globally. They bring with them the threat of terror and its consequences, which are more serious than ever \u2014 even in those parts of the world that have not experienced that phenomenon before. Migratory waves are not beneficial for anyone, certainly neither for those who must risk their lives to get to another place in the world nor for those countries that end up having to host a large number of people coming from different cultures. Those huge migratory waves lead only to the creation of parallel societies, with very serious security implications.\nI come from a Central European country whose territory saw 400,000 illegal migrants march through it in 2015. Those migrants violated our borders. They showed disrespect for our regulations,  our  culture and our way of life. The migrants attacked the police. They rejected any kind of cooperation with the local authorities. They occupied public areas. And they threatened people and families.\nWe Hungarians have first-hand experience with illegal migration \u2014 we did not just see it on television or hear it from storytellers. We have first-hand, direct experience. Based on that, I can tell members that it is\nno wonder that there are big debates going on globally as to how to handle that phenomenon. Unfortunately,  I have to tell the Assembly that the European Union (EU) has failed to find an answer to that challenge. The European Union gave a very poor answer: instead of concentrating on how to stop migratory flows, the European Union concentrated on how to encourage and manage the flows. That is basically a policy of invitation and encouragement for further migratory waves to be launched.\nAs Member States might know, the European Union wanted to introduce a system of obligatory quotas to distribute migrants among the EU member States. Hungary is among those countries that rejected that approach and were subsequently blackmailed and punished. The European Union\u2019s approach to tackling migration has turned out to be very unsuccessful and harmful. If we reflect on recent years in Europe, we see that there have been more than 30 major terrorist attacks committed by persons with a migratory background since 2015. More than 300 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured. That was not a phenomenon that Europe had previously experienced.\nEuropean institutions in Brussels kept on saying that it was impossible to stop  migration, but  that is not true. The truth is that migratory waves can be stopped \u2014 we Hungarians have proved it, with the assistance of several Central European countries, such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. We are spending more than \u20ac1 billion to build a fence on our southern border and have placed police and military officers there. We have proved that, yes, it is possible to stop the migratory waves, and it is possible to protect the borders of the countries I mentioned. Very recently, the Italian Minister of the Interior made an attempt to stop migratory waves on the maritime route. Instead of being praised, he was attacked very severely, as Hungary has been.\nBased on the experiences of recent years, international efforts should seek to stop the migratory flows and put an end to policies that encourage further migratory waves. They are harmful and must be ended immediately. With respect to international law, international organizations should make it very clear that migration is simply not a fundamental human right. It is not a fundamental human right to pick a country where one would like to live and, in order to get there, violate a series of borders and ignore national\n \nand international regulations. That is not a fundamental human right.\nUnfortunately, like some EU officials, United Nations officials have suggested a false context, as if migration were a fundamental human right. But that  is not true; that is not the case. Despite recent global events that have proved that migration is a dangerous and unfavourable phenomenon that poses serious security challenges to many regions of the world, United Nations officials have tended to speak about migration as a source of prosperity, innovation and global wealth. It is as though migration were the best thing ever that happened to humankind; but that is a false and biased claim. That is why Hungary strongly opposes that position.\nThe United Nations is currently preparing to approve the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. I can tell Member States that that is the worst possible thing that the United Nations could do with regard to responding to the challenge posed  by migration. Unfortunately, the United Nations is preparing to commit the same kind of mistake as was committed by the European Union. It is not without good reason that the United States left the negotiation process at the very beginning and that the Hungarian Government has also decided to disassociate itself, because we do not accept the principle of the global compact on migration. We do not accept the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration itself, and we will not take part in the approval mechanism. As we have stated, we absolutely do not consider it to be an obligation.\nThe global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration is a strongly biased, unbalanced and extremely pro-migration document. That is why it is very dangerous and will cause much harm to the world by encouraging further mass and illegal migratory waves. We strongly disagree with the basic approach of the global compact on migration, which tries to portray migration as though it provided a definition for the future of our globalized world, making us all countries of origin, transit and destination. Hungary does not want to be any of those three; we believe exactly the contrary, that the international community must respect the sovereignty of each country.\nThe international community must respect the right of States to make the safety and security of its own citizens a priority, and the international community\nmust respect the right of countries to decide whom they will and will not allow to enter their territory. All countries, all nations, have the right to decide with whom they would like to live. The international community should \u2014 and must \u2014 support countries in safeguarding their historical, religious and cultural heritage, as well as their social structure. The international community clearly must not put pressure on any country to get rid of its values or heritage or to change such phenomena.\nUnfortunately, the global compact on migration suggests that migration would be the best answer to the challenges regarding demography and the labour market. We strongly disagree with that. We believe  the contrary \u2014 that the international community must respect the sovereign rights of every country to make its own decisions regarding its own economic and social policy, which is supposed to be the most successful for that given country. The international community must respect the sovereign right of a country to control its own policies with regard to labour market regulations, economic policies and addressing demographic trends.\nThe global compact on migration suggests  that the border protection measures of certain countries should be judged based on human  rights.  We  find that approach extremely dangerous and harmful. That is why we strongly reject it. We believe the contrary. We believe that the protection of borders is a national security issue and is the obligation of every single country. Let me underline the fact  that every State  has the right and the responsibility to control its own border. The international community must support every State in successfully carrying out its border control responsibilities. The international community must make it clear that the illegal crossing of borders is a serious criminal offence. We must terminate policies that either encourage or mitigate illegal border crossing and those who commit that offence. Crossing borders should be possible only with full respect for international and national regulations. The violation of such regulations must result in serious consequences.\nThe global compact on migration also suggests that, by definition, a multicultural society is more valuable or better than a homogeneous society. Again, we strongly reject that definition and approach because it must be left up to the decision of the respective nation whether it believes that a multicultural society or a homogeneous society is more valuable. We Hungarians do not think that our society would be less valuable or worse than any other society that considers itself multicultural.\n \nHowever, in sum, the greatest problem is that although the text of the global compact on migration states that the compact places individuals at its core, unfortunately, that is not true. The truth is that the compact takes only the rights, interests and well-  being of migrants into consideration and does not say anything about the already existing fundamental human rights of those who would like to live their lives in their homes in safe and secure circumstances. I would like to make it clear that Hungary bases its migration policy on common sense. We do not  want to see the events  of 2015 repeated in Hungary. For us, the security and safety of Hungary and the Hungarian people are the top priority \u2014 first and foremost, security.\nWe continue to firmly and strictly protect our borders. We will not allow anyone to enter the territory of Hungary illegally. Instead of considering migration, we will continuously modernize our education system and help families to be able to raise more children in order to address the challenges of the labour market and demography in the meantime. We will preserve Hungary as a Hungarian country that is proud of its history and heritage. We urge the international community not to encourage further migratory waves to be launched but to stop the migratory flows now.\nThe international community must recognize that every person has the right to live in his or her homeland in peace and security. If that is not possible, we must help them to live in a dignified manner as close to their homes as possible until they can return there. Instead of suggesting that people risk their lives by taking to the road, pay millions of euros for the services of smuggling networks and leave their homes, we should bring help to where it is needed. Hungary helps the Christian communities in the Middle East. We spend many millions of euros on reconstructing houses that have been torn down, building schools, covering the medical expenditure of hospitals and giving scholarships to youngsters in the region. Church leaders from the Middle East usually ask us not to encourage members of their communities to leave but to help them to be able to stay where their communities have lived for centuries, or at least a long time.\nI would like to take this opportunity to inform representatives that Hungary will not support the adoption of the global compact on  migration because it is not in the national interest of our country. We will never give up our sovereign right, namely, that it is exclusively the Hungarian people who have the right\nto make a decision about the future of Hungary, our country. We will always adhere to that right of ours."

        "file_text": "The United Nations has played a critical role in promoting peace and development for all. Most indices measuring human development tell a positive story \u2014 a story of our shared success. It is a story we should tell more often.\nTechnological advances and social and economic progress that we never envisioned have become a reality, which gives us hope that humankind can once again\n \nprove that no challenge is too big to overcome and that we are right to dream big. But dreams will come true only with hard work and determination. And our common goals will be achieved only through international cooperation and by significantly accelerating the pace of progress. The United Nations is the most important platform we have for this vital cooperation.\nIceland is a small country with high ambitions. A gender-equal world is one of those ambitions. We have a solid record as one of the most gender-equal countries in the world, which could only happened through the hard work of women pioneers who changed our politics and our law to empower all women in Iceland, and, of course, with the cooperation of a few good men. Even though more needs to be done at home, we stand ready to share our experience with other States. Gender equality is a master key to unlocking sustainable development in all countries, in line with the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nAnother goal of ours is to make sure that future generations will thank us \u2014 all of us \u2014for having worked hard to save them from the worst consequences of climate change. Given its location in the Arctic, Iceland sits in the front row as a witness to disappearing ice caps and environmental change. In the drier parts of the globe, desertification continues and causes serious challenges to people\u2019s livelihoods. There is no doubt in my mind that climate change is fast becoming the single most serious challenge to global peace, security and development. While technology will be a big part of the solution \u2014 with electric cars, and with renewable energy fuelling our economies \u2014 we will also  need  to nurture our soil and restore our land as key  parts of our efforts aimed at fighting climate change. This perspective is reflected in the ambitious new climate strategy of the Government of Iceland, which has been put in place to meet our Paris Agreement targets for 2030 and to make Iceland carbon-neutral by 2040. Already, all electricity and heating in Iceland is produced from renewable resources. Our plan aims to phase out fossil fuels in transport and increase afforestation and the restoration of wetlands.\nWe have joined a coalition of other countries that have already put such plans in place because, again, the only way forward is through cooperation. High-income countries must do their share to reduce emissions and help low-income countries adapt to the effects of climate change. In the end, our reaction to climate change has more to do with self-preservation than self-sacrifice.\nSustainable development, with particular emphasis on the oceans, climate and energy, and social and economic development will be among the guiding principles of Iceland\u2019s chairmanship of the Arctic Council from 2019 to 2021. The Council has shown remarkable leadership in promoting sustainable development and practical cooperation in the high north and could be used as a model for other regions of the world, as local actions can drive global change.\nIceland is firmly committed to the 2030 Agenda, with its inclusive and bottom-up approach to development. It is a key policy priority for our Government and features strong ownership and participation by both the private sector and civil society. We look forward  to the upcoming Iceland voluntary national review in 2019 and are hoping for constructive feedback that will encourage us to do better.\nHealthy oceans and sustainable fisheries will remain at the core of Iceland\u2019s foreign policy. To reach our goal on healthy oceans, all nations must join hands. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its implementing agreements provide a tried and tested framework for the work ahead. Through our experience, we have learned that the most effective approach to conservation and sustainable use of marine resources is the regional approach. This should also be the main approach in the new \u201cbiodiversity beyond national jurisdiction\u201d implementing agreement currently being negotiated.\nIn the field of marine-resource management, we stand ready to share our expertise with others. The same applies to gender equality, green energy  and land restoration, all of which are a part of the United Nations training programmes in Iceland. Almost 5,000 experts from 100 countries have been trained since the first programme was established almost 40 years ago. This has been made possible because the knowledge was fostered by Icelandic institutions and private companies, not least within the fishery and energy sectors. Development, trade and business can and should go hand in glove in implementing the 2030 Agenda, and we are pleased to note that the United Nations is taking concrete steps to make such partnerships stronger and to bring energy, innovation and know-how into national and global efforts.\nIn the past few decades we have also seen incredible advances in medicine. These advances have enabled us to live longer despite increasingly unhealthy\n \nlifestyles. Yesterday, we vowed to actively cooperate in the prevention of non-communicable diseases and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. One neglected issue is neurological disorders, including spinal-cord injuries, which affect a billion people worldwide. The Nordic countries are working towards a common resource database on neurological disorders to facilitate medical advances in this area. We encourage others to do the same, as, yet again, cooperation will be key to success.\nEarlier this year, Iceland took a seat on the Human Rights Council for the first time. It was a proud moment for us, to join the Council, as it came at a time when Iceland is celebrating 100 years of sovereignty and the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We believe that human rights express the core purpose of the United Nations. Advancing the dignity and equality of all human beings must be our fundamental goal. Only in that way can we attain peace, security and sustainable development for all societies. We firmly believe that upholding human rights is in the interest of every State.\nThe Human Rights Council should be the standard bearer for respecting, protecting and promoting human rights around the globe. Its Member States must be willing to improve human rights in their own backyards, so that our criticism does not fall on deaf ears. We will strive to improve the Human Rights Council through dialogue and cooperation.\nOur priorities also revolve around promoting women\u2019s human rights, safeguarding our children\u2019s rights and upholding freedom from violence. We will work to advance the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, and, lastly, focus on the connection between climate change and human rights.\nIceland\u2019s history emphasizes that the prosperity and well-being of nations is, to a large extent, dependent upon protecting and promoting the rights  of our citizens, including civil, political, economic and cultural rights. As a part of our commitment to human rights, Iceland\u2019s new development cooperation strategy will incorporate an approach based on human rights, which means that further steps will now be taken to ensure that our development strategies and projects are formulated, implemented and evaluated with human rights at the forefront of our considerations.\nIt  is  better  to  light a  candle   than  to   curse the darkness. The United Nations is the heart of\ninternational cooperation but, in order to reach our common goals, a more efficient and effective United Nations is called for. Iceland strongly supports the Secretary-General\u2019s reform agenda aimed at making the Organization, which was created in a different era, fit to meet the challenges of and take advantage of the opportunities offered by the twenty-first century. We should continue to seek ways to reform the Security Council, its working methods and membership. It should not be held hostage to narrow national interests when our house is on fire. We need to show more unity. Despite the progress that we have made in every area, difficult conflicts remain to be resolved. Even today, in 2018, we are witnessing the use of chemical weapons, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, forced migration and other horrors, which should be echoes from a distant past, not everyday news.\nThe Syrian war has left the country in ruins, with more than 400,000 people dead and almost half the population displaced. A political solution continues to be the only viable path towards achieving peace. In Yemen, we are witnessing a conflict that is fast becoming the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, and there seems to be no end in sight, as regional powerhouses continue to fuel the fires of war. The issue of Western Sahara remains unresolved, and the same applies to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. The disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia remains a wound in the European security architecture. We are seeing mounting challenges in Venezuela and continue to receive reports of the horrors committed against the Rohingya population in Myanmar.\nWe must act and make full use of the tools available to hold those responsible to account, including before the International Criminal Court. All these conflicts become even more disconcerting when we consider that almost 250 million children are affected, which is casting a long shadow on their future. These conflict- stricken areas and other emergencies are also the drivers of the greatest refugee crisis since the end of the Second World War and call for a coordinated response, upon which we hope the global compact on refugees will be able to deliver.\nThe multilateral system \u2014 the very foundation of prosperity and peace \u2014 is under strain from new and challenging political agendas in which simple answers are provided to complex questions, favouring strongman politics over diplomacy, free trade, democracy and human rights. We need to stand by our convictions and\n \nprinciples both at home and abroad, while addressing some of the legitimate grievances of our citizens. Iceland has been increasing its contributions to United Nations programmes and funds. We will continue to support the United Nations and stand by its founding values and principles.\nOn 1 December, Iceland will mark the centenary of its independence and sovereignty. This period has been characterized by rapid economic growth and social development. It has given birth to a society that scores high on almost all development indices. One might be tempted to say that this success was all our own making and good luck, but that would be far from the truth. The bedrock of our independence and success has been the international rules-based order with its open markets, free trade, multilateral institutions, liberal democracy and international cooperation. This foundation should never be taken for granted, and it falls to us \u2014 the States Members of the United Nations \u2014 to ensure that future generations can enjoy the same benefits.\n"

        "file_text": "Three  years ago, when I first had the honour of addressing the General Assembly in a plenary meeting (see A/70/ PV.22), I emphasized that Greece was at the forefront of three overlapping international crises. Those crises have had a severe impact on Greek society, its economy and the country\u2019s diplomatic role in the region.\nGreece was the country most hard hit by the eurozone crisis, losing 25 per cent of its gross domestic product, reaching more than 27 per cent unemployment and significant levels of poverty. Greece was also the European country that, from a per-capita point of view, carried the heaviest burden of the refugee crisis, as over\n1.2 million people entered its islands within a period of a few months. Greece also found itself at the centre of a worsening crisis of destabilization in the Balkans\n \nand the eastern Mediterranean, with nationalism growing rapidly.\nThe question for me at the time of  my  statement in 2015, as it was for all of us, was  whether  the  United Nations, the international community and our international institutions would be able to help overcome those common challenges through collective solutions. The question was whether the European Union (EU), the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the World Bank would guide us to sustainable growth, help decrease poverty and promote more balanced global trade. The question was whether the EU, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration would help us to effectively and humanely resolve the refugee and migrant crisis. The question was whether the United Nations, the EU, NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe would promote peace and stability, combat international terrorism and resolve conflicts in my region and many others.\nIn the years that followed, however,  what  came  to the fore was a very big \u201ctrust deficit\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis international and national institutions, as the Secretary- General called it a few days ago (see A/73/PV.6). In that context, nationalist forces became stronger and stronger and finally succeeded in reframing the question. Their aggressive stance highlighted the fact that the question is not whether we can count on international institutions to solve common problems on the basis of common values, but whether those problems and values are common at all. Their logic in confronting those crises was simple and based on a not-in-my-backyard attitude.\nFor example, in dealing with the eurozone crisis, those forces called for a \u201cGrexit\u201d and the need to make an example of Greece. In dealing with the refugee crisis, they supported the unilateral closure of borders along the Balkan route as a solution, demanded push-backs into the sea and called for a small Schengen area that excluded front-line EU countries. In dealing with crises in the broader region, the solutions that they proposed were also simplistic \u2014 sanctions and preventive or humanitarian wars, and, when those led to a dead end, disengagement from the region and the containment of problems to avoid any spillover.\nIn Greece, we dynamically confronted not only the challenges themselves, but also the ideas and policies  I have mentioned about the problems. Not only did we\nmanage to stay standing, overcoming those difficulties, but beyond that we also became part of the solution, rather than part of the problem, in Europe and in the broader region. We did that without succumbing to the directives of countries, forces and institutions that disregarded the will of  the  Greek people  in favour  of their own economic or geopolitical interests and without resorting to nationalist politics that would  lead to a departure from the eurozone, an escalation of tension with neighbours and a violation of human rights and international law.\nFirst, as regards the economy, we remained in the eurozone but carried out tough negotiations for an economic programme that centred on the necessary structural reforms and not on the perpetuation of punitive and exhausting austerity. At the same time, we protected labour rights and are now establishing a respectable minimum wage, while guaranteeing fiscal space to support the welfare State and those who are most vulnerable.\nToday we have left behind economic programmes that only perpetuated recession. Our growth rate has been 2.1 per cent this year, and will be going on 2.5 per cent next year. Unemployment has fallen by 8 per cent, tourism has exceeded 34 million visits per year and  we are overachieving with regard to the size of budget surpluses, while investors\u2019 interest is growing steadily. Greece is becoming a regional energy, commercial and transport hub, while also changing the energy map and developing its strategic assets.\nSecondly, with regard to the refugee crisis, we have had to deal with the highest refugee flows in post- war European history. We did that while respecting international law and human rights. However, at the same time, we supported the difficult, but necessary, EU-Turkey statement. We did not give in to nationalistic and xenophobic voices that  called  for  push-backs into the sea or a superficial asylum process aimed at rejecting everyone. However, we also did not hesitate to accept that those who do not need international protection must return to their countries of origin where they can be safe.\nWe severely criticized those European countries that rejected their responsibility to assume their fair share of the burden \u2014 countries that call for unity when it comes to having rights but see things differently when it comes to fulfilling responsibilities. The people of Greece, despite their difficulties, opened their arms to\n \nincoming migrants, showing the world what solidarity means. Deaths in the Aegean Sea have nearly reached zero, and migrant flows have fallen radically.\nThirdly, concerning the security crisis, we confronted grave challenges caused by rapid destabilization, the strengthening of nationalism and increasing tensions in a region in which we already had stark differences with neighbouring countries. In that geopolitical context, Greece retained a policy of protecting its sovereign rights and interests. However, at the same time, it chose to become, together with Cyprus, the most important European pillar of peace, security and stability in the region.\nWe have established dynamic trilateral schemes of cooperation with Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine. We also clearly presented the message that dialogue, cooperation and respect for international law are the only ways to foster stable bilateral relations and strengthen the prospects for the region. Moreover, we remained committed to that policy in our difficult relations with Turkey, refusing again and again to give in to nationalism and the escalation of tensions. That position allowed us to show the great potential for our relations in the areas of security, migration, energy and the economy, while also making clear the need  for respect for international law in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean.\nIn that context, we clearly expressed and continue to express our full support for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue, on the basis of United Nations decisions. The solution will be based on the framework of the Secretary-General and our important Crans- Montana negotiations.\nMoreover, we are actively promoting stability and economic growth in the Balkans through a policy of resolving issues with our neighbours, which unlocks their potential to join the EU and other international organizations of their choice. One example would be our dialogue with Albania, but,  most  importantly,  the Prespes agreement with our immediate northern neighbour. That agreement is important not only for the region, but also as a model for the peaceful resolution of differences. Moreover, the agreement did not come about through the stronger party\u2019s imposition of its will and interests on the other, but through a mutually acceptable arrangement that preserves the dignity of both sides.\nI think that today it is high time that we, as an international  community,  reframed  the  questions for our future,  because we have heard  many important statements. The dilemma is not one of patriotism versus globalism. It is rather whether we will leave our world in a vicious circle of nationalist reaction and regression, which history has taught us leads to tragedy, or create the conditions for collective, progressive solutions that respect the national and popular sovereignty of each and every country.\nModern, democratic, patriotic politics cannot mean passively accepting the directives of transnational elites who are accountable to no one. Modern, democratic, patriotic politics cannot accept as a given an international order that reproduces inequalities of power and wealth, protects the rights of some to have enormous trade surpluses at  the  expense  of  others, or allows some countries to impose their will and interests on others in the name of common values no less. That is our position with regard to the eurozone, to humanitarian wars in the region and to our differences with our neighbours.\nOn the other hand, modern, democratic, patriotic politics has to be able to deal with twenty-first-century global and regional challenges, challenges that are common by their very nature and can only be dealt with collectively, on the basis of shared values. We believe that modern, democratic, patriotic politics must be based on collective arrangements and guarantees that preserve and promote peace, stability, sustainable growth and human rights, and that they  should  not  be based on a logic of unilateralism, nationalism and strengthening the powerful over the weak.\nThat means making sure that international organizations, including financial ones, become more accountable and respond to the actual needs of States and citizens. It means supporting the Secretary- General\u2019s vision for United  Nations  reform, as  well as the 2030 Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development, the coming global compact on migration, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Iran nuclear deal, despite all of its weaknesses.\nIt means finding a political solution in Syria on the basis of an inclusive political dialogue under United Nations auspices, and revitalizing the Middle East peace process towards a comprehensive solution that responds to Israel\u2019s just demand for security and the\n \nPalestinians\u2019 just demand for a State on the basis of the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nIt means promoting valuable dialogue among European and Euro-Atlantic institutions and member States with Russia, on the basis of mutual respect and with the goal of dealing with international challenges and regional crises. It means promoting peace and development in Africa, supporting the countries that carry the biggest burden in hosting refugees, such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, and confronting the root causes of migration. It means supporting positive steps for a diplomatic solution to denuclearization on the Korean peninsula.\nLastly, particularly as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it means advancing the human rights agenda, which Greece has done, after all, by granting citizenship to second-generation immigrants who were born and raised in our country, by establishing the legal recognition of gender identity and the institutionalization of civil partnership and by deepening the rights of the Muslim minority.\nThis year we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela, who once said that tasks always seem impossible until they are done. For the last eight years my country has been hit hard by three global crises. We decisively confronted the logic that countries affected by global challenges must deal with them alone. Today, although Greece still faces big challenges in its economy, migration management and diplomacy, it is again standing on its feet, bringing solutions to the region. That would not have happened without a politics that asserts popular and national sovereignty but also commits to collective solutions aimed at peace, stability and preserving human rights.\nThe challenge for our time is to once again find the proper balance as an international community, confronting international  forces that  spread  fear and hatred and that in the end seek to scale back the progress we have made. That is a genuinely modern, democratic and patriotic choice \u2014 one whose aim will be to ensure that our countries progress and prosper, rather than become pitted against each other.\nIn conclusion, the civilization of my country leaves no space for doubting the choice that we will support. I assure the Assembly that the Greek people will be standing once again, and as always, on the right side  of history.\n"

        "file_text": "I  am  pleased to begin my statement by congratulating Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly, as the fourth-ever woman elected to this position of great responsibility, and wish her every success in discharging her important duties. Ms. Espinosa Garc\u00e9s may count on the full support of Azerbaijan during her tenure.\nWe are also grateful to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his outstanding work in presiding over the Assembly at its seventy-second session. I express my profound respect for and gratitude to the Secretary- General, His Excellency Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his dedicated leadership and efforts aimed at improving the efficiency of the Organization. I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to former Secretary- General Kofi Annan \u2014 a man of peace. His legacy will remain a true inspiration for all of us.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s general debate is very timely and embodies those issues of utmost significance for all of us. We live in a globalized world where the interactions among people from different  countries are growing in intensity as they become increasingly extensive. Azerbaijan fully supports the Secretary- General\u2019s determination to genuinely contribute to\npreventing wars and sustaining peace, as well as his efforts aimed at responding to conflicts and crises in an early and effective manner, assisting Member States in their endeavours to sustain peace and build resilient and prosperous societies, making the United Nations more coherent, integrated, effective and efficient.\nAs we embark upon a path of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we need to regularly ask ourselves to what extent we are delivering on our commitments. Coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities among States, backed by adequate resources, are essential to securing a sustainable future and ensuring that no one is left behind.\nIn adopting its national development strategy, Azerbaijan has taken into account the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and continues to implement large-scale programmes for improving good governance, ensuring sustainable growth, strengthening the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights, facilitating access to public services and providing for inclusive societies.\nWe are consistent in our efforts aimed at improving the living conditions of our citizens. The poverty rate in the country is 5.4 per cent, while the unemployment rate is 5 per cent. The Davos World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report for 2017-2018 ranked Azerbaijan 35 out of 137 countries with respect to competitiveness. Among the developing countries, the World Economic Forum ranked Azerbaijan third on its 2018 Inclusive Development Index.\nAzerbaijan contributes to regional development efforts  through  promoting  connectivity.   It   plays an important role in  bringing  continents  together and creating a platform for mutually beneficial collaboration. The East-West transportation corridor, which was inaugurated in October 2017, is a transportation corridor that saves at least two weeks of time in transporting goods from Asia to Europe or the reverse. Other important projects include the South- North and South-West corridors, which, thanks to our efforts combined with those of neighbouring countries, have become a reality. Azerbaijan invests substantially in those corridors and is an active participant in both initiatives.\nThe first phase of the construction of the Baku International Sea  Trade  Port  complex  was  begun  in May. The handling capacity  of  the  port  will  be 15 million tons of cargo per year, with the possibility of\n \nincreasing it to 25 million tons in time. Azerbaijan has also initiated a transnational broadband project, namely, the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway, which aims to build a transnational fibre-optic line between Hong Kong and Frankfurt. It will be the shortest connecting line between East and West, in an era of competition where every single second counts.\nToday, Azerbaijan is providing the world with its own development model, backed by internal stability, civil unity, solidarity in society and an environment  of peace and tolerance among the various peoples and religions living together in a liberal, sustainable and dynamic economy. Inspired by its achievements in economic development, successful social policy, rich human capital and traditional values of multiculturalism, Azerbaijan  decided  to nominate  its  capital,   the city of Baku, to host the World Expo  2025.  Our theme \u2014 \u201cDeveloping human capital, building a better future\u201d \u2014 is of universal interest and has a particular significance for Azerbaijan. It is also fully aligned with the international development agenda, in particular, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe region that encompasses Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and the Caspian has never hosted a World Expo. Accordingly, World Expo 2025 Baku will be truly universal in the way it goes beyond traditional geography and presents a vivid example of a country achieving remarkable results within a historically short period of time \u2014 it has only been 27 years since Azerbaijan\u2019s independence \u2014 and proposing to host an event of the scale of World Expo. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to kindly ask States members of the International Exhibitions Bureau to vote for Baku at this year\u2019s elections, which are to be held in Paris on 23 November.\nSustainable economic growth has enabled Azerbaijan not only to focus on its national development strategy, but also to actively support international development efforts. Azerbaijan has provided international humanitarian and development assistance to a number of countries through the Heydar Aliyev Foundation and the Azerbaijan International Development Agency under the auspices of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Particular attention has been paid to addressing the needs of the developing and least- developed countries, as well as those recovering from natural disasters.\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year, we reaffirm our commitment to strengthening democracy and protecting human rights  as  top  priorities  for  the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Government is implementing large-scale programmes  so  as  to create the necessary  conditions  for  all  the  citizens of Azerbaijan to fully enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms. Education is a top priority in our domestic policy because a well-established and educated society is a guarantee of successful and sustainable development.\nThe right to health is fully ensured in Azerbaijan. Every year, more than 5 million people \u2014 half the country\u2019s population  \u2014  undergo  medical  check- ups that are fully subsidized by funds from the State budget. Azerbaijan was the first country in the Muslim world to grant women the right to vote, as early as 1918. Azerbaijan strives to ensure gender equality and empower women in public and social life. It is also worth noting that, as we live in a digital age, currently about 80 per cent of the country\u2019s population has unimpeded access to the Internet, which has become the most favoured and practical vehicle for information, media, communications and the free flow  of  ideas and thoughts.\nCombating corruption lies at the heart of SDG implementation in Azerbaijan. The implementation of innovative approaches and technological innovations has enabled Azerbaijan to make significant progress in curbing corruption in the public  sector.  Earlier  this year, the Human Rights Council unanimously adopted resolution 37/7, on promoting human rights and the SDGs through the transparent, accountable and efficient delivery of public services, which was introduced by Azerbaijan and aims to promote the Azerbaijan Service and Assessment Network brand concept of public service.\nIn early May, Azerbaijan successfully presented its periodic report within the framework of the third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review. We remain committed to enhancing dialogue and interaction with other United Nations human rights mechanisms, based on mutual respect and understanding.\nAzerbaijan is one of the world\u2019s recognized centres of multiculturalism. All ethnic and religious groups living in Azerbaijan coexist in peace and harmony. We have hosted numerous international events aimed at\n \nstrengthening intercultural dialogue. As a member of both the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan launched, in 2008, the Baku Process, whose main goal is to strengthen dialogue, partnership and cooperation between the Muslim world and Europe. Implemented under the patronage of the Azerbaijani leadership, the Baku Process provides a large-scale platform for the exchange of knowledge through interreligious and intercultural dialogue.\nIn his most recent report on the promotion of a culture of peace and interreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace (A/72/488), the Secretary-General specifically mentions the important role being played by the Baku Process in advocating dialogue among cultures. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Baku Process, and a series of events will be organized on this occasion, including the sixth high-level Humanitarian Forum, to be held from 25 to 26 October in Baku.\nFrom this rostrum, I am  pleased  to  announce that Azerbaijan will  assume  the chairmanship  of  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries next year. Throughout its history, the Non-Aligned Movement has played a fundamental role in strengthening international peace and security by promoting adherence to the principles adopted at the Bandung Conference. The chairmanship of Azerbaijan will provide further impetus for advancing the founding principles of the Movement, the sixty-fifth anniversary of which will be celebrated in 2020.\nUnresolved armed conflicts, existing and emerging security challenges and related humanitarian crises threaten to reverse much of the development progress made. The ongoing armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan continues to represent a major threat to international and regional peace and security. The conflict has resulted in the occupation of one fifth of the territory of Azerbaijan and has turned approximately one out of every nine persons in the country into an internally displaced person or refugee.\nSince the very first day of the conflict, combat operations have been  conducted  exclusively  inside the territory of Azerbaijan \u2014 virtually in the middle of the country \u2014 affecting  its  civilian  population and infrastructure. In its resolutions   822  (1993),  853\n(1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), the Security Council acknowledged the fact that military force was used against Azerbaijan, that such actions are unlawful and\nin contradiction with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and that they constitute an obvious violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. Numerous decisions and documents adopted by other authoritative international organizations have been framed along the same lines.\nHowever, the Security Council\u2019s key demands, including, first of all, the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, have yet to be implemented. On the contrary, Armenia\u2019s policy and practices clearly demonstrate its intention to secure the annexation of Azerbaijani territories it captured through military force and in which it has carried out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.\nInitially, after changes in the Government of Armenia, there were some expectations that the new leadership would uphold democratic values and the norms and principles of international law, including the relevant resolutions and decisions of international organizations, particularly those adopted by the Security Council. Unfortunately, so far no progress has been observed in that regard.\nContrary to his earlier statements, the Prime Minister of Armenia now does not even shy away from overtly attempting to regard the Nagorno Karabakh region of Azerbaijan as part of Armenia. Such an annexationist claim not only shows utter  disrespect for the norms and principles of international law and the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, but also undermines the peace process mediated by the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and its Chairs. Therefore, at the highest political level, Armenia demonstrates that its real intentions are not the settlement of the conflict through negotiations, but the continuation of the illegal occupation of the Azerbaijani territories.\nThere are continual internal political developments in Armenia of an unstable nature, with no understanding by  the international community of  what is going on  in there. That is why we cannot and will not rule out the notion that the latest statements and actions of    the Armenian Prime Minister are aimed at further escalating the situation on the ground and provoking armed hostilities along the line of contact and on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But one thing is clear: full responsibility for the consequences of this negative scenario will lie entirely with the Republic of Armenia. We therefore call upon the\n \ninternational community to  send  a  strong  message to and exert pressure on Armenia to ensure its full compliance with international law and to immediately and unconditionally start implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions adopted with regard to the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.\nArmenia has consistently obstructed the conflict- settlement process and, at the same time, refuses to conduct results-oriented negotiations and regularly resorts to various provocations designed to escalate the situation on the ground. Armenia is trying to consolidate its occupation of the seized territories by changing their demographic, cultural and physical character and preventing the hundreds of thousands of forcibly displaced Azerbaijanis from returning to their homes. In flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Armenia continues to implement its policy of illegally settling Armenians, particularly those from Syria, in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.\nArmenia\u2019s new leadership should understand that their promises to the Armenian people to make Armenia an economically developed and prosperous State cannot be possible without peace, good-neighbourly relations and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours. The earlier Armenia puts aside its territorial claims and withdraws troops from the territories of Azerbaijan, the sooner peace can come to our region and the sooner prospects for Armenia\u2019s development will improve.\nThere is now much talk of democracy and the Armenians of the Nagorno Karabakh  region of Azerbaijan. But what about the Azerbaijani population of Nagorno Karabakh and the Azerbaijanis from the seven surrounding districts who were subjected to brutal ethnic cleansing and forced to leave their places of origin, homes and property? If the new Armenian leadership is calling itself democracy, then they have to act in accordance with the rule of law and democratic values. It must let those uprooted people return to their homes, and it must withdraw its armed forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, as demanded by relevant resolutions of the Security Council and other international organizations.\nAzerbaijan sincerely believes that there is no alternative to peace, stability and mutually beneficial regional cooperation, and is the most interested party in the earliest possible political settlement of the conflict. At the same time, no settlement of the conflict can be\nreached if it violates the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and is inconsistent with international law. The resolution of the conflict is possible only on the basis of the respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally recognized borders."

        "file_text": "I am pleased to extend our warmest congratulations to Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s and the people of Ecuador on the occasion of her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. That election is all the more gratifying because Ms. Espinosa Garc\u00e9s represents the Latin America and Caribbean region. She joins a small but distinguished group of women who have presided over the Assembly in the 72 years of its history. Guyana pledges its unwavering support as she discharges her responsibilities.\nLet me also take the opportunity to pay tribute to the previous President, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his successful stewardship of the Assembly\u2019s seventy-second session.\nI would also like to take a moment to salute the memory of the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a son of Africa and a servant of the peoples of the world whose dedication to the global community was epitomized by a lifetime of selfless service to the United Nations.\nGuyana is guided by the value of multilateralism, sometimes termed liberal multilateralism, which has oriented its policies since independence. That rules- based system, with a pivotal role for nation States alongside key international and multilateral institutions,\n \nis valued by Member States, particularly small States. It is largely predictable, as it is based on the rule of law, and it has enabled extensive economic development and improvements in human welfare across the globe since its establishment after the 1939-1945 war.\nIn spite of that success, multilateralism is now under attack in some quarters of the world, and recently there have even been calls for it to be replaced. Some of the challenges fuelling such calls are obvious. The rapid expansion in the number of States over the past few decades has contributed to the exponential growth in the number and complexity of decision-making units in the system. The consequences of the latter have been most evident in some of the very areas in which global multilateral governance has had the greatest success in the past \u2014 trade, economic growth and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.\nAt the United Nations, we are faced with stymied efforts at Security Council reform. The debates about the reforms needed to move us forward and out  of  this cul-de-sac have yielded many ideas. But rather than turning to outdated models, solutions based on misconceived economic goals, or some form of national exceptionalism, we need to explore complementary organizational forms and arrangements that could help simplify decision-making.\nIn their attempts to look outside the box for solutions, some observers have turned to the idea of including new partners, such as non-governmental organizations and social networks working alongside States and Governments, as well as to some degree of regionalization of organizational structures \u2014 the so- called Web 2.0 option. It may also be worth exploring other voting rules for decision-making. In other words, we need to fashion a more equitable and just variant of multilateralism rather than its replacement.\nSerious proposals should seek to preserve the valued elements of multilateralism, because as we face more intractable problems, the capacities of individual States do not give us the ability to solve those problems. It is no wonder that the Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization (A/73/1), asserts that the United Nations offers a platform where Member States, regional organizations and civil society can find solutions to global problems that no nation can resolve by acting alone. Working together is not an option. It is the only answer. Guyana therefore pledges its full support for the strategic vision proposed by\nthe President, \u201cDialogue and the strengthening of multilateralism as a catalyst for the well-being of all persons and a sustainable planet\u201d.\nGlobal governance and peace are inextricably linked. In that regard, Guyana has noted with satisfaction the efforts of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in close collaboration with Member States, to reform and streamline the machinery of the United Nations so as to make it more fit for purpose. We fully support the reform of the peace and security pillar, with its emphasis on preventive diplomacy.\nPeace is also inextricably linked to sustainable development. In that regard, the United Nations disarmament agenda is a central element in our efforts to achieve a stable, secure and peaceful world order. Guyana has demonstrated its commitment to that agenda, most recently in its signing and ratification   of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. We recognize, however, that the commitment of every Member State to the disarmament agenda is key to achieving the world to which we aspire. The onus is on all of us to fulfil the obligations that we have taken on ourselves by becoming State parties to the various legal instruments concerned with questions of disarmament and non-proliferation.\nFor Guyana and the wider Caribbean, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and their associated ammunition poses one of the most serious threats to human security and sustainable development in our region. International drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, unregulated cyberspace and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons divert resources that could otherwise be invested in other critical areas. We believe that with effective international cooperation and assistance, small countries like Guyana can tackle that illicit trade and ultimately create safer communities, countries and regions and a safer world.\nAdherence to the cardinal principles of the sovereign equality of States, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the peaceful resolution of disputes are the most effective guarantees of peace. Members are no doubt aware of the controversy that has arisen between Guyana and its neighbour the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela over Venezuela\u2019s contention that the 1899 arbitral award, which settled the boundaries between the two countries, is null and void.\nOn 30 January 2018, Secretary-General Guterres took the decision that the controversy with the\n \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela should be referred to the International Court of Justice. The decision of the Secretary-Generalisbindingontheparties. Accordingly, in March of this year, Guyana filed its application in the Court, seeking an affirmation of the validity of the 1899 arbitral award and the international boundary that it established. Unfortunately, notwithstanding its obligation to do so, Venezuela has so far refused to participate in the proceedings. Guyana sincerely hopes that Venezuela will change its mind. There is still time for it to do so. Guyana wishes to express its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his important contribution to the resolution of this long-standing matter and looks forward to a final judgment by the International Court of Justice.\nAs a responsible member of the global community, Guyana seeks peace not only in our region but throughout the world where the scourges of war and conflict are an obstacle to development. They divert attention away from the pressing problems of development and the enhancement of human well-being.\nWith regard to the Middle East, the region of the world that has given birth to thethree great monotheistic religions of our age, we reiterate our call for a two- State solution to the generational  conflict  between the peoples of Palestine and Israel. Those two peoples have much to gain by living side by side in peace. Like people everywhere, the people of Palestine, including the inhabitants of Gaza, have a right to life, a dignified existence and their own homeland.\nSimilarly, we deplore the suffering being endured by the Rohingya population. We call on the international community to take the necessary steps to ensure respect for the human rights of the affected population. At the same time, we commend the efforts of Bangladesh to provide a safe haven for the refugee population, with the assistance of international agencies.\nCloser to home, in the Caribbean region, we again join the overwhelming majority of the international community in calling for the removal of the trade and economic embargo on our sister Caribbean nation of Cuba. That embargo hinders the right of the Cuban people to development and the enhancement of their material well-being.\nGuyana also welcomes the measures being taken to reposition the United Nations development system in order to better align its operations with the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We\naccept that that repositioning is a shared responsibility, and Guyana is committed to playing its part. Guyana has fully embraced the holistic and people-centred approach to development enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals. Our nation is currently engaged in efforts to mainstream and integrate those Goals into our national development strategy, known as the Green State Development Strategy, which seeks to ensure that development is not achieved at the expense of the environment, notwithstanding the fact that Guyana will soon become a significant oil producer, regionally and internationally. We will wean Guyana away from its current near-total dependence on non-renewable sources of energy. We are turning to renewable sources such as hydroelectricity, wind, solar and biomass.\nGuyana is unalterably committed to the principles of sustainable development and to working with the international community and all partners to help combat the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels, to which we are particularly vulnerable as  a low-lying coastal State. For that reason, Guyana\u2019s strategy is to emphasize inclusive transformation, sustainable natural  resources, energy transition, resilient infrastructure, human development and well- being, Government and institutional foundations and international cooperation, trade and investment.\nGuyana fully recognizes the necessary \u2014 nay, critical \u2014 contribution of women and girls to its sustainable development. Women and girls constitute more than half of the world\u2019s population. The underutilization of their potential represents a serious loss of resources in the global effort to promote human development. We are trying to ensure that the management of that development is undertaken with women and girls fully represented at the helm of the decision-making in Guyana. We therefore applaud the steps taken by the Secretary-General to ensure parity in the appointment of United Nations senior management, including Resident Coordinators in the field.\nI want to express Guyana\u2019s satisfaction at the successful conclusion this year of the intergovernmental negotiations on a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Its provisions are consistent with the 2030 Agenda and the commitments made in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. It is our hope that this global framework will help to manage international migration flows in all their dimensions for the benefit of all States, both of origin and destination, and for the benefit of migrants themselves.\n \nGuyana looks forward to the successful adoption of the compact at the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, to be held in December in Marrakech.\nWe meet this year in disconcerting times. Our planet, the only one we have, faces grave threats on multiple fronts, including to the very existence of life as we know it. As I have already hinted, there are many who question whether our Organization, the nations  of the world united, will be able to unite our strength in order to maintain international peace and security while promoting social progress and better standards of living in larger freedom and reaffirming faith in fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person and the equal rights of men and women. It is for us to decide and to summon the will to work for those ends. Our children and our children\u2019s children will judge us. Guyana reaffirms its strong resolution to doing its part within  the  limits  of  its  capacity and resources.\n"

        "file_text": "I have been accorded the privilege of continuing to serve as Japan\u2019s leader for the next three years. As I address the General Assembly\n \ntoday for the sixth consecutive year, I do so with a feeling of renewed resolve.\nIn the next three years, I will do  everything in  my power to strengthen the free trade system and to recast the post-war structure of international relations in North-East Asia. In my view, the Japanese people have been very much hoping to see their national leaders serve as flag bearers for free trade, since after the war Japan enjoyed remarkable growth thanks to the advantages of trading as a beneficiary of a free and open economic system. That free trade system enabled the countries of Asia to achieve take-off one after the other and fostered the middle class in all of them, against a backdrop of the large-scale direct investment that Japan has made in those countries since the 1980s. In every case, that was made possible thanks to an international economic system that was rules-based, free and open. If Japan, the country that reaped the greatest benefits of all under that system, should ever fail in its support for maintaining and strengthening that system, who else should we expect to rise in support of it? Japan\u2019s responsibility is indeed tremendous.\nThis is also Japan\u2019s mission, rooted in its own history. Other than the coal that supported modern Japan\u2019s industrialization, our nation has had no other resources to speak of. But even though post-war Japan lacked resources, when it devoted itself to reaping the blessings of trade, it succeeded in realizing growth that was called miraculous. Japan was the very first country to prove through its own experience the principle of the relationship that exists between trade and growth and that has now become common sense. Japan has now taken on the mission of imparting the benefits of trade to the world.\nThere have been times when I have risen above intense domestic debates by waving the flag of free trade. There was no greater joy  for  me  than  when the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement took final shape and was quickly approved by our National Diet. In addition, Japan and the European Union have signed an economic partnership agreement whose scale and scope are worthy of special mention in history. But that said, we must not be complacent. I will have to push my efforts up a notch and aim still farther ahead.\nIn addition to Japan\u2019s commitment to the World Trade Organization, which is a given, I will make every possible effort to conclude negotiations on a\ncomprehensive regional economic partnership, which will create an enormous free-trade area in East Asia. And above all, I value our new free, fair and reciprocal trade talks with the United States. Japan and the United States have both advanced the free trade system internationally for  many  years.  That  is  evidenced by the fact that Japan\u2019s direct investment has created employment in the United States for some 856,000 people nationwide \u2014 a number second only to what the United Kingdom has achieved. At present, in contrast to the 1.74 million vehicles exported annually from Japan to the United States, the number of Japanese cars manufactured within the United States is 3.77 million. That is a win-win situation at its finest. I intend for Japan and the United States to continue that kind of relationship. But that is hardly unique to our bilateral ties with the United States. Under the flag of free trade, Japan has built up relations with many countries and regions where we can mutually assist one another, and we will continue to do that going forward. In order to expand free and fair economic rules, suitable for the twenty-first century, into the vast region extending from Asia and the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, the countries that have created the system and reaped the greatest benefits from it \u2014 that is to say, countries like Japan \u2014 must lead the effort. That is what I believe.\nAt the beginning of my statement, I said that I would do everything in my power to recast the long- standing post-war structure of international relations in North-East Asia. Together with President Vladimir Putin I am now working to end the stalemate between our countries, which has  seen  no  movement  for more than 70 years. President Putin and I met at the beginning of this month in Vladivostok for our twenty- second summit meeting, and I will meet with him again in the near future. We must resolve the territorial issue between Japan and Russia and conclude a peace treaty between our two countries. Once a Japanese-Russian peace treaty is signed, peace and prosperity in East Asia will be more secure.\nAt this time last year in this very Hall, I strongly urged North Korea to tackle its issues relating to abductions, nuclear power and missiles (see A/72/ PV.8). As someone who has called for the full implementation of all the relevant Security Council resolutions, I am extremely interested in the potential for change in North Korea, which is now at a crossroads where it will either seize the historic opportunity it has been afforded or fail to do so. North Korea has both\n \nuntapped natural resources and a labour force whose productivity can be greatly enhanced. Japan will not change its policy of seeking to resolve our unhappy past history and normalize relations with North Korea once the abduction, nuclear and missile issues are dealt with. We will be unstinting in assisting North Korea  to unleash its potential. However, there is one thing I must reiterate over and over again. We will ensure that all Japanese abductees are returned. I am determined to make that a reality, and in order to resolve the issue, I am also ready to break through the wall of mutual distrust between us and North Korea, make a new start and meet with Chairman Kim Jong Un face to face. While so far nothing has been decided regarding a summit meeting between Japan and North Korea, I am determined that if we hold one it must help to resolve the abductions issue.\nI also want to comment briefly on relations between Japan and China. The mutual visits at the leadership level that began this year will continue, with me visiting China next month, to be followed by my invitation to President Xi Jinping to Japan, thereby expanding our bilateral relations and improving the stability of the entire region.\nWhen we have recast the current confrontational geopolitical structure in North-East Asia, the maritime corridor from the Arctic Ocean to the Sea of Japan and through the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean will become  increasingly  important.  Japan,  which is located right above it and also possesses a vast exclusive economic zone, hopes that we can ensure stability and peace in those waters, as well as in the airspaces above them. The countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations lie at the confluence of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and in eras long past it was our forerunners, living in what we now call the Pacific island countries, who crossed those two oceans to introduce products to faraway East Africa. What I call our free and open Indo-Pacific strategy derives from our desire to preserve the blessings of open seas together with those countries, as well as with the United States, Australia, India and others, and indeed all countries and peoples who share those aims. What we must ensure  is that the rule of law and a rules-based order control our broad and expansive seas and airspaces, and that they in turn are backed by solid institutions \u2014 hence my strategy.\nThe other day, foreign students in Japan proudly returned to their home countries of Malaysia, the\nPhilippines and Sri Lanka with new academic degrees in hand, master\u2019s degrees in maritime safety and security policy that can be obtained only in Japan. As well  as the students that Japan\u2019s  Coast Guard sends  to the programme, it also takes senior officials from various coast-guard authorities in countries all over Asia. The students who graduated the other day were the third cohort to enter the programme. Maritime order is a matter not of power but of the rule of law and a rules-based order. Every year, a class learning that enduring truth and taking it as a guiding principle for their lives will head out from Japan to the seas. That  is very promising, and it is Japan\u2019s noble mission to cultivate the people who will protect and defend a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nAs I was preparing this address, I created a new if modest programme. At the beginning of 2019, we will invite approximately 10 elementary and junior-high- school teachers from the Gaza Strip to Japan. That will be the first such group and we will continue to invite teachers every year. Teachers who come to a place such as Japan, so different for them both culturally and historically, will naturally see the situation in Gaza and the Middle East in a wider perspective, and we hope that the experience will enable them to see their own hometowns and region anew and work in a unique way to give them solace. It goes without saying that for peace to be achieved, efforts must be made on both sides. But hopefully this programme of ours will represent some hope for the teachers from Gaza and the children in their care. Twenty years from now, 200 teachers will have had the experience of visiting Japan, and the students taught by them will number in the thousands. I look forward to that day.\nThe goal of Japanese diplomacy, which to some extent I have conveyed to the Assembly today, is to help to bring certainty to the future of the world and the region. In addition, what I want is for the young people who will live in the Japan of the future to vigorously take on challenges. The duty of our generation is to create an environment conducive to that. It is as if a new breeze is about to blow in Japan.\nAt the end of April and the beginning of May next year, His Majesty the Emperor will abdicate and His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince will succeed to the throne. In fact, it is the first imperial succession in 200 years to result from a sitting Emperor\u2019s abdication, and in October 2019, we will welcome guests of honour from around the world who are coming to express their\n \ngood wishes. Next June, Japan will host the Group of 20 summit. As Chair of the meeting, I intend to lead the discussions about issues facing the international community, including the state of the global economy and environmental issues. Soon after, in August, Japan will host the seventh meeting of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development. The Conference, which Japan has hosted diligently since 1993, has earned the unwavering trust of national leaders all across Africa. At the Conference we will discuss universal health coverage, whose importance I have highlighted a number of times. And lest we forget, next year Japan hosts the Rugby World Cup, and in 2020 Tokyo is hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Our eyes will continue to be fixed on the future.\nWhen Japan and the Japanese people fix their gaze squarely on the future, Japan increases in vitality. Japanese citizens focused on the future will become people who are determined to take on the responsibility of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The next generation of Japanese youth will be commendable flag bearers for the United Nations spirit. I am absolutely certain of that.\nIn conclusion, I want to say that in the light of the lack of progress in reforming the Security Council, the significance of the United Nations in the twenty-first- century world is already being severely questioned. But that is precisely why Japan will never waver in its contributions to the Organization. I will end by pledging that Japan, alongside Secretary-General Guterres, will push forward with reform of both the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "As we gather in this Hall and work together to make the United Nations more relevant to all people, the positive developments in Africa over the past year merit this body\u2019s attention. Let me start with a paradox.\nIn no other region is the sense of transnational solidarity and unity as deeply felt as in Africa. The idea that our respective national identities stand in contradiction to pan-Africanism is unheard of in our context. And yet, despite that unique civic endowment, Africa has too often stood out for division and dysfunction in practice. That left Africa unable to articulate and advance its common interests. We ceded responsibility for our future to others not by force but by default.\nBut times are changing rapidly, and therefore the management of Africa\u2019s global position must also change. The trend on our continent is towards closer and more productive cooperation, both through the African Union and our regional economic communities. The evident decline of old certainties and authorities is not bringing turbulence to Africa, as would have been the case in a previous era. On the contrary, the effect has been to focus Africa\u2019s attention on the urgent need to get our house in order and fundamentally change how we do business. That is why the African Union initiated a major financial and institutional reform more than three years ago. We are already seeing practical results.\nNew financial discipline has produced an African Union budget that is 12 per cent lower than last year\u2019s. The share of funding supplied by member States has also\nincreased substantially. Contributions to the fund that helps pay for African Union peace support operations are at the highest level since its establishment, in 1993. And earlier this year, the historic agreement on the African Continental Free Trade Area was signed, which was the culmination of decades of effort. Once that is in force, Africa\u2019s place in the global economic and trade architecture will be redefined.\nEconomies of scale and higher levels of intra-African trade will help our continent attain the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. We will also see new possibilities for public-private partnership with Africa\u2019s growing private sector. This year also provided examples of regional security affairs and key political transitions being handled in a peaceful and forward- looking manner. More effective consultation and leadership is reducing the need for external mediation, and that is how it should be.\nThe momentous developments in the Horn of Africa \u2014 in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and even Somalia \u2014 are the most remarkable. The region\u2019s leaders deserve our full support as they set aside decades of mistrust and work towards a comprehensive settlement. It is important for the Security Council to collaborate closely with the African Union to accompany that process of normalization.\nIn Zimbabwe as well, the next stages on the country\u2019s path of progress warrant steady encouragement from the international community. However, there are other situations in Africa \u2014 notably in the Central African Republic, Libya, the Sahel and South Sudan \u2014 where serious problems remain unresolved, despite so much potential. Africa and the world should come together and do what needs to be done to harmonize overlapping initiatives and ensure that agreements are respected.\nPeace and security are the foundation of economic and social well-being. Yesterday we happily marked the centenary of Nelson Mandela\u2019s birth with the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit. In that spirit, we are already set to embark upon a new chapter, with cooperation between the African Union and the  United  Nations on stable funding for African-Union-mandated peace-support operations. The draft resolution to be introduced by Africa\u2019s three Security Council members has the full backing of the African Union. That step will also align with the Secretary-General\u2019s new Action for Peacekeeping initiative. That once again reflects the\n \nfact that the dividend of a more focused and functional Africa benefits everyone.\nIn that wider context of even stronger partnership between our institutions, it is important for the African Union\u2019s diplomatic representation here at the United Nations to be accorded the status and weight enjoyed by other regional bodies. The theme for this year\u2019s general debate is \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people\u201d. That requires a commitment to achieving real multilateralism where it has too often been lacking. The current two-track system of global governance is unsustainable. A few get to be the ones to define the norms by which others shall be judged. But standards that do not apply to everyone equally are not universal. Addressing that  imbalance  in  the very  foundation of our system is what will give shape to a revival of multilateral cooperation and renew the legitimacy of the international institutions that are so crucial to our planet\u2019s future.\nIn the years ahead, we look forward to deepening the important partnership between Africa and the United Nations and  to  advancing our shared agenda of peace and security, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment,  environmental   protection   and shared prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\u201cThe only route that offers any hope of a better future for all humanity is that of cooperation and partnership\u201d (A/56/ PV.7, p. 2). Those were words spoken from this rostrum by the late Kofi Annan 17 years ago, at the dawn of the twenty-first century. This year, we commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War. Exacerbated rivalries, economic tensions and vengeful withdrawals led to misunderstanding, frustration and hard facts on the ground. Unilateral actions and failed dialogue led to the irreparable wiping out of sacrificed generations, as half of the twentieth century was crushed by the horror of two world wars and the shame of the Holocaust.\nIt took the foresight and courage of a generation  to provide the outline of an international order based on values and rules. From the ashes of tragedy in the previous century, the birth of the European Union and the United Nations has created hope for a better world. The European Union has enjoyed a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Its concrete achievements include a free economy based on  fair competition, freedom  of movement and the establishment of social and environmental standards.\nThe European Union is the result of a tireless dialogue that is sometimes complex and often restrictive. That dialogue is based on an ambition that goes far beyond simply adding to national interests. That ambition is the promise of the founding fathers, namely, the freedom and dignity of every citizen, the rule of law and democracy as a bulwark against arbitrariness in governance. Those are the pillars that have laid the foundations for peace and security. The Charter of the United Nations declares the importance of dignity and respect for every human being, regardless of where they come from, the colour of their skin, their origin, philosophical or religious beliefs or sexual orientation. Our universal values are the strongest and most reliable benchmark for addressing each of the challenges that the world faces.\nDemocracy and the rule of law are always the best guarantees of the realization of fundamental rights and freedoms, because the rule of law is the arbiter\n \nthat protects the weak from the strong. The rule of law means that we assume the consequences of our actions. The rule of law is the rejection of impunity. The rule of law is also the guarantee that science and knowledge are better shared among us. Putting human beings at the centre and establishing the rule of law as the basis for international order is what should drive the engine of multilateralism.\nMultilateralism is not a hollow and meaningless concept. On the contrary, it is a conviction, because dialogue is tireless, including with those with whom we do not easily share the same points of view. That dialogue is key. Multilateralism is cooperation and negotiation; it is the battle of ideas and arguments rather than weapons. Multilateralism is the rejection of violence. It is up to us to be committed to a better, more just, safer and more sustainable world.\nWho here believes that bringing together the 193 national sovereignties represented in this Organization with each acting unilaterally could miraculously produce a virtuous and effective response to our common challenges? That is an illusion. It is the same illusion as thinking that the invisible hand of the market can naturally and miraculously lead to progress and shared well-being. Capitalism needs rules, and so does humankind. Of course multilateralism requires patient efforts. Of course there may be failures. However, multilateralism is the only way to eradicate poverty, neutralize terrorists and preserve the natural resources of our planet. My country regrets that international agreements, the result of tough and intense negotiations, can  be  swiftly  and   unilaterally  jettisoned.  In  just a few months, the nuclear agreement with Iran,  as well as trade agreements and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, have all been cast aside by one of the signatory parties.\nTrust and cooperation between sovereign nations implies respect for the promises and  commitments that have been made. History has always shown that the law of the survival of the fittest does not protect anyone; quite the opposite. The most lasting solutions are always those that are balanced and widely accepted. As we know, Iran was on the brink of acquiring nuclear weapons and, as we  know,  the negotiations on the problem were long and difficult in reaching a compromise. It took reciprocal courage to overcome deep mistrust and hostility, and we know that the agreement is not perfect, given that it does not cover Iran\u2019s ballistic programme. At the same time, the\ninspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirm that Iran has been fulfilling its commitments. Should the agreement be thrown aside owing to its imperfection? Should we not open a new chapter of multilateral negotiations to complement and improve that agreement?\nUnilateral, brutal and unpredictable actions make the world more dangerous. They result in imbalance and frustration and serve as seeds of conflict. On the other hand, we are made stronger by dialogue and negotiation with mutual respect. Dialogue helps us to deal with and resolve our disagreements and offers better results. For 70 years, the United Nations has persistently worked to improve the world, based on a common foundation of fundamental values. It is our duty to identify the challenges, develop strategies and, especially, to act. Our Organization has immeasurable potential, and in that connection I would like to commend the intelligent, energetic and tireless work of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\nThroughout its history, my country has been committed to working for peace and building consensus. In that strong conviction, Belgium has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the next two years. We will live up to the confidence placed in us. We will ensure that we foster dialogue with all actors. We want to promote a respectful and transparent debate so as to inspire a greater spirit of trust among us. We will work for security, prosperity and respect for our planet.\nCollective security is the ultimate requirement, and it is just common sense to seek to prevent conflict whenever possible. That is why we support the permanent monitoring of all indicators of  violence. We are also in favour of setting up early-warning mechanisms, because serious violations of human rights should never leave us indifferent. The manipulation or rigging of elections, violations of territorial integrity and threats of the use of force are always early-warning signs of future conflict. The search for a peaceful and political solution must always be at the heart of our approach, and peacekeeping operations must always be part of a credible political framework.\nFinally, let us be honest with each other. The presence of Blue Helmets on the ground must not become a smokescreen for political resignation, either in conflict zones or at the regional or international level. Every peace mission must be regularly evaluated\n \nagainst the yardstick of its contribution to realizing the political goal in the noble sense of that term. During our time as a member of the Security Council, we would also like to focus on protecting the most vulnerable in armed conflicts. In our view, the protection of civilians, especially children, as well as ensuring dignity and respect for women and the safety of schools, hospitals and humanitarian channels, are the essential priorities. We cannot tolerate the intolerable. Those who flout, often cynically, those fundamental principles of international humanitarian law must be punished. The fight against impunity must also seek to create the conditions for living together in peace after the conflict. Living together in peace and harmony is an existential issue in the Near East and Middle East. The tragedies that we are witnessing in Syria, Libya and Yemen remind us of the long road still to be travelled. We cannot allow regions to become arenas for the cruel and deplorable battles of warring nations, with no regard for the humanitarian tragedies that subsequently ensue.\nTwenty-five years after the signing of the Oslo Accords, the peace process in the Middle East remains at a standstill. The excitement generated by some developments, which often contradict international law, only creates further obstacles and difficulties and dims hopes for peace. We maintain our support for the two- State solution, with the two States living side-by-side in peace and security, with Jerusalem as a shared capital.\nThe proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction poses a serious threat to the future of humankind. We will remain fully engaged in non-proliferation efforts.\nWe want a more prosperous world, with more shared development and the freedom to be entrepreneurial and to innovate, create and  trade. The development  of science and knowledge and the rejection of obscurantism are always the basis for  development and the improvement of living conditions. The digital economy and the artificial-intelligence revolution bring with them fears and uncertainties, but above all they offer new opportunities for a better world, if those advances are designed to serve everyone.\nWe must also ensure that we, always and everywhere, encourage efforts to promote good governance, transparency and the fight against corruption. For centuries, trade has promoted peace among peoples. Trade develops mutual understanding, respect for cultures and traditions, sharing and the\nexchange of experiences. Trade leads to prosperity. Prosperity leads to peace. Freedom of trade must be based on healthy and fair competition and a shared level playing field, with ambitious and reciprocal social and environmental standards. In that respect, the recent trade agreement between the European Union and Canada, concluded despite much resistance, including in my own country, offers such guarantees. I am delighted with the impressive and rapidly achieved results, with jobs and investment at its heart, leading to better social protection and therefore more freedom.\nBefore 2050, the African continent is expected to have a population of 2.5 billion. One in four human beings will therefore be African. For a long time, my country has been advocating for a new, more global, dynamic and ambitious partnership with the African continent. We know how much potential there is in Africa. Energy, agriculture, infrastructure and digital technology offer areas of opportunity for the future. I want to make a strong appeal here for a sacred Africa- Europe alliance \u2014 a strong and sustainable alliance for the development of both continents in the service of our peoples, an alliance for investment, trade and jobs in Africa and Europe.\nI say to our African friends that it is up to us, that we should turn the page on the antagonisms of the past. Let us heal ancient wounds. Let us forge a partnership free of nostalgia or guilt. And above all, let us dare to renounce charity, which eases the conscience but also entails a dose of humiliation. Let us draw up a peer- to-peer strategy based on the shared values of the rule of law, democracy and respect for our fellow citizens. In ten years, we can, if we wish, build an unequalled and unprecedented area of prosperity. I advocate a very ambitious free-trade agreement, from continent to continent, a global and reciprocal partnership, a win-win situation for all.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sets out the path for a better and fairer world, and everything is there \u2014 poverty eradication, access to health and education, gender equality and the fight against global warming. The only possible option is the general mobilization and ownership of this joint programme. All of us, at all levels, let us roll up our sleeves, decide and act, because the countdown is on. There is urgency about this, and the results are fundamental.\nClimate change is not constrained by borders. Natural resources are limited and the number of people\n \non Earth is constantly increasing. The stubbornness of some in denying the reality of climate change is of the same order as the stubbornness of those who in the past denied that the Earth was round. Prosperity must be sustainable. It can no longer be based on a frenetic and selfish exploitation of our precious natural resources. Oceans, biodiversity, air quality and health are precious assets that must be cherished and respected.\nNatural disasters are falling on us one after another and are ever more spectacular, ever more deadly. Just a few weeks ago in India, in Kerala, unprecedented floods forever shattered the fate of 450 people, displacing a million others who had been displaced and are now homeless. The harmful effects of climate change are going to cause or aggravate conflicts. In West Africa, for example, access to water is leading to increasing tensions between herders and farmers, with the risk of escalation on the basis of ethnicity and identity. Faced with that existential challenge for our children, our responsibility is shared. Alone, we can do nothing. Together, we can do anything.\nThe Paris Agreement on  Climate  Change  must be implemented. We must, of course, give up certain habits. We need to change our behaviours. But it will be worth doing, because the future of humankind is at stake here.\nThroughout history, human beings have always migrated. Our host country here is a great example. Men and women  from elsewhere, seeking to discover a new world, have built  a  free  and  prosperous nation. This year, we recorded the highest number of migrations ever. It is not a question of being for or against an unavoidable phenomenon. The issue is about whether we can manage it in an orderly way so as to reduce fears, tensions and conflicts. We must first pull migration out of the claws of smugglers and traffickers in human beings, the abject slavers of modern times. We must also reject the trap of deliberate confusion fomented by populists on all sides, whether from the far left or the far right.\nMy country intends to continue to  fully assume its responsibility to humankind. During the past three years, we have granted international protection to nearly 45,000 people, and that is many more than in the past. I am also in favour of an effective policy of return for those who do not meet the conditions set forth at the international level.\nFinally, it needs to be said that the time has come to pursue legal and orderly forms of international mobility, for example, to enable students to get an education and then return home, or for other economic reasons. In December, in Marrakech,  my  country  will sign the global pact on migration, because that document is a step in the right direction. It clarifies the various concepts and could be a lever for the future and for a more organized and controlled management of international mobility. Indeed, we can say that extremists on all sides and human traffickers are in  the same boat. The former instrumentalize and fuel the migration issue for electoral and political purposes, the latter for low financial purposes.\nIn conclusion, peace is our most precious asset. History has always shown that peace requires courage and vigilance at all times, and that no continent or country is immune to the poison of the fear of others, or of hatred or selfishness. We all come from different backgrounds, with our histories, our cultures, our traditions, but also with our emotions, which stem from the roots of our past. The demands of memory must serve our lucidity. The demands of memory must rally our energy so  that it  can rise to the challenges of this century. Those challenges know no borders. Development, the fight against terrorism, climate change, are all problems that no country, regardless of its economic or political power, will be able to overcome by itself.\nBeyond our many differences, we will always share a common feature, our humanity. Every human being, by the simple fact of his or her birth, must be free. That being\u2019s dignity must be recognized and respected. It is a pivotal value, and the fundamental condition for making the world progress unflaggingly towards greater hope and optimism. Our method is based on our faith in a committed, creative, invigorating multilateralism. We reject all forms of inertia and resignation, because we believe that the best is within us.\n\u201cLaw and order rather than violence; tolerance rather than selfishness; knowledge rather than obscurantism; respect for others rather than hatred or fear\u201d: that is my country\u2019s credo. Belgium is a loyal, solid and reliable partner. We will spare no effort to make the world a safer, more sustainable and, above all, more just place.\n"

        "file_text": "I have  had  the privilege of addressing the General  Assembly  over the past 21 years as Samoa\u2019s Prime Minister, and my message has remained consistent throughout those years. Put simply, climate change poses our single greatest threat, especially to small island developing States like Samoa \u2014 albeit not through our doing or choice \u2014 and the need for the international community to take effective action to mitigate its impact is urgent and real.\nClimate change also encompasses the breadth of security issues facing our blue Pacific region, including human security, environmental and resource security and transnational crime and cybersecurity. As we have explained to the United Nations before, climate change is one of the most pressing security challenges facing island countries, affecting food security and access to safe water and fundamentally affecting our ability to draw sustenance from the pristine ocean and seas that surround us. It is the highest priority challenge facing the countries of the world and does not discriminate between rich and poor.\nThe logic of our perspective is simple. Climate change affects the whole of Samoa\u2019s realities and aspirations. It affects our society, economy, culture, faith and way of life and will continue to be our overriding policy concern and major preoccupation,\n \nand that of our entire Pacific region, today and well into the future.\nIt is a societal problem requiring a decisive response from the world community. Its global reach and impact should unite and strengthen our resolve, not weaken and divide us. As a united community, there is a great deal that we can do to arrest, and even reverse, the threat of climate change, although its effects are worsening by the day. Acting alone, no one country or single group of nations or organization can win the war against climate change. The divergent, yet inextricably linked, interests of Member States demand that we work together.\nOur Paris Agreement on Climate Change was a beacon of hope, especially for vulnerable island States. It is based on shared responsibilities, trust, collaboration and principled action. It demonstrates a new brand of cooperation and a broad outlook, where the narrow pursuits of self-interest and a reliance on economic and political expediencies were to be set aside. It was meant to be a timely reminder that no action is too small or insignificant. All contributions matter, and every action counts, irrespective of who provides it. Importantly, it places the responsibility of addressing climate change squarely on every leader and every individual country in terms of the implementation of their nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement.\nIt is indeed worrisome and alarming that the level of commitments to the Paris Agreement by Member States will not keep global warming anywhere below 1.5\u00b0 C, which is the ideal and moral goal required to save planet Earth. Without that, the continuing existence of low- lying islands in our Pacific region and elsewhere will be in grave doubt. We must work together with a sense of urgency and commitment to address climate change today. It should not only be science that recommends what we should do but also our very conscience and political will to follow through.\nClearly, we want leaders who view the world as a single constituency where all must work together within the limits of their capacity and capability to be part of the total solution. Samoa also wants to be part of that solution, because it is in our interest to do so. As for those suggesting that they are being asked to implement bold actions just for the sake of our vulnerable islands, they need to be quietly reminded that in the final analysis, implementation initiatives will ultimately benefit their economies, their people and the survival\nof their countries as well. In fact, the whole world will stand to benefit.\nFor vulnerable countries, the issue does not require the setting of new targets, the commissioning of more studies and reports or even more polite talking-shops and structured dialogue sessions. What is needed now is adaptation in the interest of long-term survival. The United Nations remains our last best hope to provide the political will and the necessary commitment to turn the tide against climate change.\nSamoa appeals to States Members of our Organization in positions of world leadership to lead the charge in finding and implementing solutions to the causes of climate change. As custodians of our world\u2019s environment, we owe it to our future generations to do what needs to be done quickly and decisively. In the same way that nations in leadership roles are called to account to do the right thing for our world, all States Members of the United Nations must uphold their part of the bargain in the work that needs to be done. Without that cooperation from all Member  States,  reaching the objectives that we all know must be achieved will continue to elude us.\nThe Pacific region is already dealing with the destructive impact of climate change and disasters. Unprecedented cyclones, floods, droughts, sea level rise and ocean acidification are taking their toll  on  the health and well-being of our peoples, environment and economies. Disaster-related  economic losses, as  a percentage of gross domestic product, are higher in Pacific island countries than almost anywhere else in the world.\nOur people are waiting; the world is watching. It  is incumbent on each individual leader and country to raise the level of ambition, not just as an aspirational goal but as deliverables under the Paris Agreement. For the Pacific peoples and our blue Pacific region, urgent, ambitious action on climate change is the only option.\nWe welcome the determination that we heard in the Secretary-General\u2019s remarks to the General Assembly earlier this month to sound the alarm on the need for bolder action on climate change (see A/73/PV.6). Those are big demands to deliver on, and it  would be naive  to think otherwise. But when the future existence of sovereign island nations, populations and cultures are at stake, there is a moral imperative for the world to act decisively and collectively.\n \nThe Pacific leaders are increasingly conscious of and concerned about the security of our region, and we look at security not only from the orthodox perspective of State security but also for what it means for us as Pacific communities. The Framework for Pacific Regionalism identifies security as one of the four objectives of regionalism, a security that ensures stable and safe human, environmental and political conditions for all.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum leaders have renewed their commitment to work together as one blue  Pacific continent, particularly in view of the renewed geopolitical interests in the Pacific region. Suddenly, the Pacific is swimming in a rising tide of so-called fit-for-purpose strategies, stretching from the tip of Africa, encompassing the Indian Ocean and morphing into the vast blue Pacific Ocean continent, which is our home and place. The big Powers are doggedly pursuing strategies to widen and extend their reach and creating a far-reaching sense of insecurity. The renewed vigour with which a strategy based on a free and open Indo- Pacific Ocean is being advocated and pursued leaves us with much uncertainty. For the Pacific, there is a real risk of privileging Indo over Pacific.\nWhile the Pacific region is currently enjoying a period of relative stability, drivers of instability exist in the region and beyond. The 2017 State of Pacific Regionalism report indicated that shifting global and regional geopolitics are creating an increasingly complex and crowded region that places the Pacific at the centre of contemporary global geopolitics. That trend, coupled with broader challenges, such as climate change, rising inequality, resource depletion, maritime-boundary disputes and advances in technology, will continue to shape the Pacific regional security environment.\nWhile the world belabours the issues of security based on military might and the wonders of technological advancement in achieving such ends, our priority in the Pacific is to maintain the stability of our Governments and countries. We can do that by reviewing of our governance pathways and ensuring that our elected leaders respond to people\u2019s needs. Pacific Island Forum members have a very proud history of working collectively in response to events and issues that have challenged regional security, peace and stability, from the 1985 Rarotonga Treaty, which created a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific, to a collective approach to addressing the existential threat of climate change.\nThe Pacific region\u2019s current geopolitical and geostrategic context underlines the need for an integrated and comprehensive security architecture incorporating an expanded concept of security. A stable and resilient security  environment  provides the platform for achieving the region\u2019s sustainable development aspirations.\nIn 2017, in recognition of those considerations, the Pacific Forum leaders agreed to build on the Biketawa Declaration and other security-related declarations issued by the Forum as a foundation for future regional strategic responses, recognizing the importance of an expanded concept of security and regional cooperation in building resilience to disasters and climate change. The leaders have also prioritized action on climate change and disaster-risk management, fisheries and ocean management and conservation, all of which have significant security elements.\nAs if being vulnerable to climate change were not a lifelong challenge, the label of Pacific small island developing State can also bring with it unintended trials and tribulations. For far too long, the international community has been given to believe that our States are little and classified as have-nots. We are susceptible to being characterized as countries that have little and that should be grateful for whatever is offered to us. We are highly protective of our means of livelihood and have embraced regional action to ensure the sustainability of our fisheries resources. We are actively asserting our ambitions to ensure that there is inheritance for the generations to come. Any approach to engagement with partners must be genuine and durable, premised on understanding, friendship, mutual benefit and a collective ambition to achieve sustainable results. It must also be non-partisan and non-interventionist. I repeat that any engagement must be non-partisan and non-interventionist.\nIn that process, our partners have fallen short of acknowledging the integrity of  Pacific  leadership  and the responsibility that our leaders have for every decision made in order to garner support for the sustainable development of their nations. Some might say that there is a patronizing nuance that suggests that Pacific nations do not know what they are doing or are incapable of reaping the benefits of close relations with countries that are, and will be, in the region for some time to come. To the extent that emerging partners have engaged with Pacific countries without conditionality, the relationships are perceived to be associated with\n \nproblems of corruption or unprecedented environmental degradation. We have the tendency to be bemused by the fact that the reaction is an attempt to hide what we see as strategic neglect.\nWhere we are now would not have been possible without the valuable support of our circle of partners and the value of the partnerships that we have nurtured and cultivated over the years to respond to our people\u2019s multitudinous needs. The friendly relations that we have with some partners are construed by others as compromising and obtrusive, prompting some to speak up for us in order to ward off the influences that we are supposedly too naive to recognize. By the same token, we are given alternatives that reflect interests beyond altruism and improvement of the poor. As Pacific leaders we need to ask ourselves what we ought to do in order to make a difference for ourselves and for the world and to promote our values, which are premised on peace, stability and security.\nOur geographical isolation and insularity no longer shield or protect us from today\u2019s increasingly complex and dynamic security challenges \u2014 transnational crime, nuclear proliferation, challenges to sovereignty and humanitarian crises. The rules-based international system is being bent out of shape. Gone are the days when we took only what we needed from our environment and were much more conscious of the importance of the continuity of our cultures and values, unadulterated by the infringing, impinging world around us. In those days we did not worry much about borders because the original migrations of our peoples defined for us our ocean space and place. Poverty was not a part of our consciousness because we cared for each other and the oceans provided their bounty.\nWe should not be influenced by economic dependence, as that is a compromise in itself. We should seek to strengthen domestic cohesion, develop resilience and rethink our governance pathways. The leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum are committed to a vision for the Pacific \u2014 that it  should be a  region  of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion and prosperity so that all Pacific people can lead free, healthy and productive lives now and into the future. Moreover, we have committed to working together to achieve that vision. The blue Pacific platform offers all Pacific countries the adaptive capabilities to address  a changing geostrategic landscape. The opportunity to realize the full benefits of the blue Pacific rests on our ability to work and stand together as a political\nbloc. The challenge for us is to maintain solidarity in the face of the intense engagement of an ever-growing number of partners in our region. We should never let that challenge divide us.\nIn four weeks\u2019 time, Samoa will host the interregional meeting of small island developing States and their development partners in preparation for the five-year review of the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA Pathway) during the high-level week in September next year. My Government looks forward to welcoming our guests, and we thank Member States, in particular small island developing States, for agreeing to allow the SAMOA Pathway to make  a  brief  return  to  its  namesake  and birthplace.\nLet me conclude by acknowledging the support of all States Members of the United Nations, Samoa\u2019s circle of friends, that supported our candidate\u2019s re-election to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.\n"

        "file_text": "Ghana salutes the historic election of Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session as the first female  Latin American President of the General Assembly, and congratulates her most heartily. Her election reinforces our common belief that gender equality must be a central feature of the global agenda.\nThirteen days ago, we laid to rest in  his  home soil of Ghana our brother Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations  and  the first from sub-Saharan Africa to occupy that exalted position. On behalf of the Government and the people of Ghana, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Secretariat, led by the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the whole world community for the outpouring of grief and condolences that we received on the passing of Kofi Annan. We were deeply touched that so many world leaders and people took the trouble to come to Accra to bid him farewell. Kofi Annan\u2019s passionate and profound belief in the United Nations and his certainty that a better organized and stronger United Nations would make the world a better place is an ideal that should not be allowed to die.\nToday we continue to be faced with the stark reality that resolutions, norms and any number of votes in the\n \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly mean nothing without the political will of the international community to enforce them. We continue to try to work out what the role of the Organization should be. Should it be just a club of nation States that exists to look after their own interests? What of its formation by \u201cwe the peoples\u201d, as declared in its founding document? Does the theme that we have chosen for this session of the Assembly have any relevance in real life? And do we want to make the United Nations relevant to all people? Do we want an Organization that ensures shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, or should it remain a place where resolutions are adopted but ignored with impunity?\nWhen some of the nations of the world gathered in San Francisco 73 years ago and signed the landmark document that created the Organization, the  world was very different from what we have today. I am not referring only to the difference in the number of States in the room on that occasion or the difference in the mode of travel that brought the leaders to that meeting, as opposed to the jet planes that brought us all to New York this week. I am not referring either to the tweets by which we communicate now as opposed to the elegant handwriting that they employed in 1945. I am referring to the theme that we have chosen for this session of  the General Assembly, and I wonder if it would have been comprehensible to that group in San  Francisco. It is a different world in which we currently live, and we should accept the fact that the Organization must change to suit contemporary needs.\nTen years ago, as the General Assembly was starting its proceedings, the world was plunged into a financial crisis. The first scenes of that crisis were played out  on a street not  far from where we  are gathered, but  the consequences were felt, and continue to be felt, around the world in small countries like Ghana. Some say that upheaval lies at the heart of the change in politics and outlook throughout the world. Today, as we speak, a trade war is being stoked between the two largest economies of the world. The  consequences will affect those who have had no say, including small countries like Ghana. Those events provide proof, if any were needed, that ours is an interdependent world. We in Ghana, and people in other parts of the African continent, are determined to pull our countries out of poverty and into prosperity. We do not believe that a nation needs to remain poor or become poor for others to become prosperous. We believe that there is room\nand that there are enough resources on the planet for us all to be prosperous. But it does mean that the rules and regulations that we fashion to guide our dealings with each other have to be respected by all of us.\nFrom the environment to  trading rules, we  have to accept that there cannot be a different set of rules for different countries. The United Nations provides the best vehicle to date for all nations to address their aspirations and challenges. Ghana has always conveyed its belief in the United Nations and sought to contribute its share to efforts to make the Organization successful. We have embraced the Sustainable Development Goals, and we have integrated the 17 ambitious Goals into  our national vision and budget. We intend for Ghana  to take its turn in July 2019 and present its voluntary national review during the High-level Political Forum of the Economic and Social Council. We will share our successes and challenges, as well as opportunities for new and continuing partnerships.\nIt is important to reiterate that advocating for a world order in which all countries sign up to obey the rules does not mean that we insist on uniformity. We take pride in what distinguishes us as Africans and as Ghanaians. Fifty-five per cent of the work of the Security Council last year had to do with Africa. Unfortunately, that invariably meant peacekeeping and poverty-related issues. We no longer want to be the place that requires the intervention of peacekeepers and poverty-fighting non-governmental organizations, no matter how noble their motives. Our regional bodies, like the Economic Community of West African States, and our continental body, the African Union, are making systematic efforts, despite significant handicaps, to bring peace and stability to the entire continent, and, sooner rather than later, they will succeed. We know that we must get our population educated and trained, and we are setting about that. We must address our infrastructural deficit.\nThe traditional methods for tackling that problem will not provide the answer. We are looking for new ways to resolve it. Ghana, like many countries in Africa, is forging relations with China,  so  as  to  make arrangements that can help address part of our infrastructure deficit. That is not a uniquely Ghanaian or African phenomenon. It has not been lost on us that the developed, rich and well-established countries have been paying regular visits to China and seeking to open new economic ties and improve upon existing ones. It is also not lost on us that much anxiety is being expressed about the possibility of  a  recolonization of\n \nthe African continent by a new Power. We should learn from history. It was at the turn of the twentieth century that China\u2019s first railways were built by Western companies and were financed by Western loans to a nearly bankrupt Qing Dynasty, and it was under those circumstances that a certain strategic port called Hong Kong was leased for 99 years. The rest, as the saying goes, is history.\nToday the former victim of Western railway imperialism is lending billions to countries throughout Africa, Asia and Europe to build not only railroads, but also highways, ports, power plants, other infrastructure and businesses. The historical echoes are certainly worrisome, but surely we must, and can, learn from history. We in Ghana must build roads, bridges, railways, ports, schools, hospitals, and we must create jobs to keep our young people engaged. It is obvious to us that the development trajectory on  which  we had been for many decades had not been working. We are trying a different one, and we would appreciate  the support and goodwill of the world, especially in helping to curtail the huge flow of illicit funds from our continent.\nIt is in everybody\u2019s interests that we, who are counted among the poor of the world, make a rapid transformation from poverty to prosperity. We are determined in Ghana  and,  increasingly, in  more  and more parts of Africa, to chart our own paths to prosperity and pay our own way in the world. We are no longer interested in being a burden on others. We will shoulder our own responsibilities and build societies and nations that will be attractive to our youth. We have the necessary sense of enterprise, creativity, innovation and hard work needed to engineer that transition, hence our vision of a Ghana and an Africa beyond aid.\nIt is equally important that the United Nations be reformed so as to be able to preside over the changed and changing world to which we all aspire. The powerful nations must be willing to adapt to changes to make our world a better place. After all, we all inhabit the same planet, and we all owe the same duty of care to ensure its survival. The African common position on United Nations reform, as expressed in the Ezulwini Consensus, remains the most comprehensive proposal for the reform of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council. It is time that the global community endorse it so as to create a modern United Nations fit for purpose in our time.\nMay God bless the United Nations and us all."

        "file_name": "ARM_73_2018.txt",
        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We hope that the deliberations under her able leadership will  be fruitful.\nIt is a great honour to address the Assembly as a leader who has recently become the Prime Minister of Armenia as the result of a people\u2019s revolution that is now known as Armenia\u2019s velvet revolution. I would like to take a moment to share the story of our victory over the authoritarian rule that preceded that revolution. The people of Armenia succeeded in bringing about an unforeseen and unprecedented revolution, which took place without violence, victims or public disorder. That was no coincidence, as our intention was to make a revolution based on love and solidarity. From the very beginning, we declared that we were ruling out violence of any kind. We declared that even if violence was used against us, we would not respond with violence. We declared that our response would be with raised and open hands, smiles and love.\nWhen we started this political process there were just a few dozens of us marching from Gyumri, Armenia\u2019s second-largest city, to the capital, Yerevan. When we reached Yerevan and showed our determination and devotion to the principle of non-violence, our entire nation rose up against the ruling regime in unity and solidarity. We won without a single shot being fired and with no victims, through peaceful demonstrations alone. We succeeded against all expectations. Even well-known experts and think tanks were sceptical about our chances for victory. Against all odds, I was elected Prime Minister, and in a Parliament where I had only four reliable votes, including my own. Yet it was possible. It happened because people were firm in their demands, and the Parliament, which had been elected just a year before, had no choice but to follow the people\u2019s will.\nWhile that Parliament continues to operate today, it no longer represents the people\u2019s will, as it also failed to do before and during the revolution. Why? The short answer is that the elections that created it  involved  the buying of votes on a massive scale, the misuse of administrative resources, and oppression.\n \nAn important test of our ability to hold genuine free, fair and competitive elections was the Yerevan city council election that took place just before my departure for New York. The fact that for the  first time since Armenia became independent, all of the main parties congratulated the winning candidate and nobody questioned the official results shows that a completely new political culture has been established in Armenia. In the same spirit, we are now getting ready for snap parliamentary elections in our country. Free, fair and transparent elections will become an irreversible reality in Armenia and will bring strong and vibrant democratic institutions that function through a system of checks and balances. Protecting our citizens\u2019 rights and ensuring freedom of speech and other forms of expression and of assembly are very high on our Government\u2019s agenda. From now on, there can be no possibility of manipulating the electoral process and undermining the people\u2019s trust.\nI would also like to stress that the current situation in Armenia is not just a change of Government or ruling party. It represents the establishment of a new political and governance system, which we have named \u201cthe people\u2019s direct rule\u201d or \u201cthe people\u2019s direct governance\u201d. In order to institutionalize the system, we intend to guarantee the expression of the people\u2019s will not only through elections but also through local and national referendums, in order to engage our people in the decision-making process.\nHaving been a political prisoner myself, I understand how much it means to be able to speak out and decide one\u2019s own future. Now that we have assumed our responsibilities, our team has a clear vision and the strong political will we need to launch fundamental reforms aimed at eradicating corruption, creating transparent, accountable and efficient governance mechanisms, safeguarding human rights and the rule of law, ensuring an independent judiciary and advancing economic growth through a free and competitive business environment and an atmosphere favourable to investment.\nDespite the radical transformation in our internal political life, our foreign policy agenda will not involve any U-turns. The continuity of Armenia\u2019s foreign policy shows that our country is a predictable and reliable partner. Our international commitments are not subject to revision. Our position is clear: Armenia stands ready to have constructive dialogue and to cooperate with\nall partners. However, we do not intend to develop our relations with one partner at the expense of another.\nWe underline the importance of the role of multilateralism at the global and regional level. Armenia\u2019s cooperation under the umbrella of the United Nations is comprehensive and vibrant. Without going into minute detail, I would like to mention our contributions to global peace through the United Nations-led and -supported peace operations, with their impressive geographical scope, which extends from Afghanistan to Lebanon and from Kosovo to Mali. That has special significance for our country. While we are dealing with serious security concerns, we realize that the security of any one country is inextricably linked to that of all others and that global peace requires concerted action.\nWe are a truly global nation, with hundreds of Armenian communities all around the world, which explains Armenia\u2019s sensitivity to global threats that could put our fellow Armenians at risk in different parts of the world. The sizeable Armenian community in Syria is facing an existential threat from the ongoing crisis there. Armenia has tried to contribute by dispatching humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable regions, and we are ready to enhance our humanitarian mission, aimed at meeting the most pressing needs of our community in Syria. As a nation that has experienced the horrors of genocide, Armenians have a great awareness of security concerns involving their compatriots and are ready to do their utmost to protect them.\nThe peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict continues to occupy a central place on our foreign policy agenda. The status and security of the Republic of Artsakh is an absolute priority for Armenia in the negotiation process. Any attempt to resolve the conflict through military means represents a direct threat to regional security, democracy and human rights. Armenia will continue its constructive engagement in the peaceful resolution of the conflict within the format of the co-Chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has the only internationally recognized mandate to deal with the conflict.\nAzerbaijan should change its disrespectful attitude to the negotiations, abandon the idea of any military solution and implement all previous agreements. Furthermore, if Azerbaijan is truly committed to the\n \npeace process, it should start talking to the main subject of the conflict, Nagorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan declares at every possible occasion that Karabakh should be a part of its territory, while at the same time announcing that it will not negotiate with Nagorno Karabakh. The question is how Azerbaijan can make a claim to Nagorno Karabakh without even speaking to it. Is that possible? It is possible only if the Azerbaijani Government wants the territory, but not the people in it. It therefore becomes obvious that  the  Azerbaijani  leadership\u2019s  intention is to cleanse Armenians from Karabakh, as it did in Nakhchivan. That entitles Nagorno Karabakh to argue that if Karabakh were to become a part of Azerbaijan it would mean its total extermination. Karabakh must therefore not become a part of Azerbaijan unless we want to trigger a new Armenian genocide.\nTo sum up, let me reiterate that the conflict can and should be settled only through mutual compromise on all sides, in an atmosphere conducive to peace, not war. Last but not least, I would also like to express my satisfaction to the Secretary-General for his unwavering support to the OSCE Minsk Group co-Chairs\u2019 approach and the related efforts.\nThe topic of our deliberations, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d,  shows  the  consistent  nature of our approach to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations and its development agenda should indeed be relevant and accessible to all. No one should be left behind, as we keep repeating in our collective efforts. Earlier this year, in July, Armenia presented its first voluntary national report on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. That important exercise coincided with a decisive political period animated by vibrant democratic processes and the launch of a wide range of reforms in my country. Armenia is committed to the creation and development of a knowledge-based, innovative platform that will leverage the impact and accelerate the implementation of the development agenda.\nIn that regard, we recognize the indispensable role of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as the importance of cooperation in working with other potential partners. As a newly elected member  of the Economic and Social Council and a candidate for the Human Rights Council for the 2020-2022\nterm, Armenia will do its utmost to contribute to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and to the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThis is the year when we mark the seventieth anniversary of two of our most important human rights documents, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Each has its own history, and each has become a cornerstone for the development of international law. They served as the basis  on which Armenia launched the Global Forum  against the Crime of Genocide. This year the Global Forum will be dedicated to issues of genocide prevention through education, culture and museums. I encourage delegations to come and contribute  to  the  work  of the Forum.\n\u201cLiving together\u201d is the theme of the seventeenth summit of the International Organization of la Francophonie, which will be held in October in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, a city that is some 2,800 years old. It is a great honour and a  privilege  for Armenia to be part of the wider French-speaking family and to promote tolerance and mutual respect through cooperation in the areas of culture, education and innovation. I reiterate once again our invitation to delegations to attend the summit of La Francophonie with several events planned within that framework."

        "file_text": "We live in paradoxical times, as optimism and pessimism equally characterize our lives. We recently adopted landmark documents, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. At the end of the year, the international community will give the green light to two more instruments that inspire particular hope for changing the situation in  the  world  for  the  better,  namely,  the global compacts on refugees and migrants. The implementation of those unique initiatives is intended to transform human life on the globe in a drastic way so as to ensure that globalization is equitable and a win-win situation, to eradicate poverty and to preserve the planet for future generations.\nThe search for answers to global challenges and the quest for ways to reach common objectives clearly show that no country can do it alone. There can be no individual progress without collective progress. That is why, no matter how justified the criticism of the United Nations may be, we still need the Organization\n \nas a unique platform for cooperation and as an effective multilateral instrument based on principles that ensure equal and respectful treatment of each and every country and its priorities and needs. In order to assist States in implementing the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda, we need effective United Nations country teams on  the ground that can effectively help countries achieve results in moving towards sustainable development. That is where we see the essence of the reform of the United Nations development system.\nPursuing a globalization that will meet everyone\u2019s interests and managing that globalization for the common good are key objectives in the modern world. Yet we can see that there are evident difficulties in  that area. Globalization is being accompanied by new geopolitical and geoeconomic lines and splits, not only in regional contexts, but also on a global scale. A kind of civilizational trap is emerging in which the demand for integration goes hand in hand with fragmentation, protectionism and even confrontation. Located in the heart of Europe, Belarus, on the one hand, is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union; on the other hand, it has an interest in pursuing deep economic cooperation with the European Union. Squeezed between two geopolitical power centres, we fully feel the interplay of geopolitics and geoeconomics.\nThe conflict in Ukraine and the rising tensions in the region, the sanctions and counter-sanctions, all weigh heavily on our country, if not directly, then indirectly, leading to substantial economic losses. As a medium- sized country with one of the most open economies in the world, because we export up to 60 to 70 per cent\nof our gross domestic product, Belarus is heavily dependent on external markets and international trade. That is one of the reasons why we consistently support building a fair, predictable and non-discriminatory trade and economic architecture, both in Europe and in other regions \u2014 one that is aligned with the interests of all countries. We believe that that architecture should be underpinned by the implementation of multi-tiered integration projects.\nOwing to its geographical location, Belarus is particularly interested in closer cooperation between the Eurasian Economic Union and the European Union. Indeed, our western border remains the only economic border on the huge space stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok, and, in future, perhaps even Shanghai. That is why Belarus has consistently advocated for what is known  as  the  \u201cintegration  of  integrations\u201d as a principle of cooperation that seeks to find optimal ways to bring together economic growth and sustainable development.\nAchieving the goals of the global 2030 Agenda, with its overarching promise to leave no one behind, requires a particular focus on and international support for middle-income countries. Indeed, it is that group of countries that is home to 5 billion of the world\u2019s  total 7 billion people, and it wields the greatest potential  for economic growth and sustainable development. On the other hand, it is within that group of countries that three quarters of the world\u2019s poor reside. They are the most vulnerable to such factors as global economic fluctuations, the consequences of regional conflicts, natural and human-caused catastrophes, climate upheavals and epidemics \u2014 all of which threaten social and economic stability and exacerbate inequality at both the regional and the global levels.\nIn that context, it is unjust that development progress continues to be gauged exclusively on the basis of per capita income. That criterion does not reflect the economic, social or  environmental features inherent in middle-income countries. For Belarus, it is evident that the multidimensional nature of the challenges faced by the countries in that category, including our country, requires the application of multidimensional development criteria that would also be instrumental in designing the Untied Nations system\u2019s result- oriented strategies of cooperation with United Nations agencies. Belarus hopes that the  high-level  meeting to comprehensively discuss those issues, which the President of the General Assembly plans to convene\n \nin the near future, will provide a serious impetus for the United Nations to design and implement specific measures in that area.\nAnother multidimensional issue is increasingly coming to the forefront. Humankind has entered a new era, as digital technologies are drastically transforming our lives. The importance of the digital economy for sustainable and comprehensive economic growth is something that our country  understands  very  well. In March, the presidential decree entitled \u201cOn the development of the digital economy\u201d, whose ambition it is to turn Belarus into an information-technology country, entered into force. The Belarus High-Tech Park is developing rapidly and has shown record rates of growth, both in terms of the number of residents and in terms of its exports.\nDigital technologies have been rightly compared to rocket fuel for national economies. They enable the rapid introduction of  innovations into various areas  of human activities, such as education, the consumer market and social cooperation. They stimulate business activity, generate revenue and create jobs.  At  the same time, digitization will  lead  to  drastic changes in the labour market, doing away,  in  the  process, with a whole array of professions that will no  longer be required in those new conditions, which will make many people employed in those sectors and industries extremely vulnerable.\nClearly, Governments in developed and many developing countries will soon confront a number of challenges, including how to adapt their own economies to the global digital transformation, how to effectively manage those processes at the national level and how to cope with unintended consequences generated by digitization. In that regard, Belarus proposes that the United Nations engage in international  cooperation on digitization and forward-looking technological planning with a view to facilitating sustainable development. The purpose of such cooperation would be to assist developing countries in finding their own niche within the global digital economy and to increase the benefits of digitization, as well as to ensure their equitable and fair distribution.\nWe therefore welcome the establishment by the Secretary-General of the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, and we hope that the Panel will pay particular attention to the capacity-building of States in that area. It is absolutely clear that the strengthening\nof such capacities would be fruitless unless the effort is predicated on the values of sustainability and prosperity for all. It is precisely those values that form the fundamental basis for the tasks required, which can be accomplished only if all countries work together.\nUnfortunately, those values are often fall  victim to confrontational thinking, which we are  seeing more frequently. At the United  Nations  summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda in 2015 (see A/70/PV.4 et seq.), the President of Belarus contended that sustainable development would be unattainable in the absence of lasting peace and security. That point is completely relevant today. True sustainability cannot be achieved outside a framework of security, the strength of which is being tested day in and day out.\nOne shared threat that we face is terrorism. Combating it requires a comprehensive approach whereby all countries uphold the principles of international law and refrain from the use of double standards. We welcome the efforts of the United Nations leadership and stand willing to support them so as to mount a common front against terrorism. Our country\u2019s contribution to the global processes of unification in that area will be to convene a high-level international conference on preventing terrorism in the digital age, which we will organize jointly with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and which will be held in the Belarus capital, Minsk, in a week\u2019s time, on 9 and 10 October.\nTurning to the overall issue of international security, it is evident that the world today is facing unprecedented challenges and threats. Confrontation in international relations increasingly evokes the notion of a new cold war. More and more frequently we hear threats of the likelihood of the use of weapons of mass destruction, even if only as a result of an inadvertent conflict or an accident. That points to a crisis in diplomacy and seriously undermines the authority of the United Nations as the key international organization tasked with preventing international conflicts.\nThe degree of divergence in relations and views among a number of great Powers has reached a boiling point. When it comes to some issues, the situation has become absurd. The principal organs of the United Nations \u2014 first and foremost the Security Council \u2014 are turning into arenas for confrontation, political grandstanding and self-assertion, with\n \nconfrontation prevailing over dialogue and geopolitical ambitions taking the upper hand over common sense.\nLike many in this Hall, I do not, regrettably, have recipes for how to fix the situation. But we are deeply convinced that there is no choice other than to forge a global order on the basis of shared values. It is patently clear, however, that it is impossible to arrive at shared values by means of coerced democratization and violence, which subvert legitimate authority. The bitter geopolitical experience of the past three decades tells us that we should all take a common interest in such values. We believe that the idea of stability could serve as a unifying paradigm. Bringing about stability means stopping the unwinding spiral of geopolitical chaos in its tracks. What needs to be done to achieve that?\nFirst, stability implies that States retain their role as the primary international actors and that State sovereignty is respected. Contemporary international law is predicated on those key principles, which are enshrined in basic United Nations  documents.  On  the one hand, those texts reflect the right of States to choose their own form of political governance, as well as their own path and priorities of development, while, on  the other hand, they refer to the non-interference  of countries in the internal affairs of other countries. Unfortunately, adherence to those principles is not universal in today\u2019s world. The politics of sanctions, economic coercion and political isolation against so- called rogue regimes are frequently found in many countries\u2019 foreign policy toolkits. We have all borne witness to the decades-long policies of economic, trade and financial blockade against the freedom-loving State of Cuba, which not only run counter to United Nations resolutions, but take a heavy toll on that country\u2019s social and economic development.\nSecondly, stability is also  about  strengthening the State, along with its role in domestic affairs. We are absolutely convinced that only strong States can provide security for their populations and ensure their well-being. We believe that people living in places where real, firm authority is absent could testify to that truth better than anyone else. Therefore, if we really have a stake in ensuring global stability, we should seek not to undermine the State, but rather to strengthen it.\nThirdly and finally, stability very much relates to relations among the great Powers, which today must, once again, learn to listen to one another and hear each other\u2019s arguments, in addition to being willing to\nembrace reasonable compromises. In the past, it was the great Powers that determined the destiny of the planet. Today, they no longer enjoy such an exclusive prerogative. Still, unity among the great Powers on shared values and their leadership in advancing them are a sine qua non for progress in many areas.\nIn that spirit, the President of Belarus, Alyaksandr Lukashenko, advanced an initiative to begin a comprehensive dialogue  on  international  security last year. Its objective is to overcome the existing disagreements that plague inter-State relations in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian space. We are convinced that only dialogue can help resolve the deep crisis of trust in international relations and lead to mechanisms conducive to peace, international security and sustainable development.\nCan one day or one meeting change history? The great leader of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, called that moment a tryst with destiny. I think that our common task is to increase the number of such moments. We must pool our efforts to find common solutions that are acceptable to everyone.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to extend our congratulations to you, Madam President, and your friendly nation on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I assure you, Madam, of the delegation of the Sultanate of Oman\u2019s cooperation as you guide the Assembly to success in this session.\nWe also express our appreciation to the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, His Excellency Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for the way in which he steered the Assembly\u2019s work and for the decisions that were taken under his leadership. We also take  this opportunity to fully commend Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization and reform its mechanisms in order to better achieve the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe work of the United Nations must focus on addressing challenges, settling international disputes and conflicts, and achieving peace. Given that my country believes that dialogue and negotiation are the best means to resolve differences, we emphasize that the Sultanate of Oman will spare no effort in supporting initiatives that lead to peace, security and stability in the Middle East and throughout the world. We consider peace to be the main building block for stability and development. Accordingly, we hope that Member States will collaborate in ways that are consistent with the principles of good-neighbourliness, respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\nThe Palestinian question is the central issue  in  the Middle East. The international community\u2019s cooperation in creating  an  environment  conducive  to the parties concerned ending the conflict is an urgent strategic necessity. We believe that, despite the difficulties in the current situation and the impasse in the dialogue, an environment favourable to fruitful discussions between the Palestinian and Israeli parties that might lead to a comprehensive settlement based on the two-State solution would be more welcome than ever, especially since the absence of a Palestinian State will only perpetuate violence and terrorism.\nThe Sultanate of Oman is willing to make every effort to restore a climate of optimism so that a comprehensive agreement can be reached and a future of peaceful coexistence between the Palestinians and the Israelis built. The creation of a peaceful environment\n \nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli parties is essential to establishing peace  in  the  Middle  East  region  as a whole.\nWe also call on the countries of the world, particularly the United States of America \u2014 which plays an essential role in achieving peace and stability in the world \u2014 to consider all available opportunities to support peace efforts and to facilitate the work of international organizations. We must not allow peace to be sacrificed.\nThe suffering of the Republic of Yemen can be seen in the tragic economic and humanitarian situation in the country, which stems from the collapse of infrastructure in the health, education and economy sectors and the loss of other basic services that affect the daily lives  of citizens in Yemen, as well as the spread of disease, inadequate medical treatment and a lack of medicines. That tragic situation demands that we all redouble our efforts to help Yemen.\nThe international community must implement a project that would allow the Yemeni people in various provinces to gain access to humanitarian aid, while facilitating the use of airports and seaports to that  end. Indeed, the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen requires that such measures, at a minimum, be taken. Accordingly, my country welcomes the efforts of the United Nations and the Arab coalition countries to establish a humanitarian medical airlift for patients suffering from critical conditions so that they can receive proper medical treatment. Those scheduled flights are being supervised by the United Nations in collaboration with the Yemeni parties.\nMy country also underscores its support for the efforts of Special Envoy Martin  Griffiths.  We  call for further efforts to be made to support his mission, in particular to enable the holding of meetings and consultations with all Yemeni parties and the provision of transportation of the parties so that they can participate in such meetings. We believe that a political solution should be based on the reality on the ground in Yemen and that all Yemeni parties and political entities in the country and abroad should be given a chance to participate in planning a bright future for their country.\nAs we are deeply affected by the humanitarian suffering of the Yemeni people, we would like to emphasize that the Sultanate of Oman will continue  to provide facilities and humanitarian assistance  to the  brotherly  Yemeni  people,  and  that the  land, sea\nand air outlets between the Sultanate of Oman and the Republic of Yemen, which are the only available means for Yemenis to interact with the outside world, will remain open, based on the principles of brotherhood and good-neighbourliness and the deep historical and social ties linking our peoples.\nWe commend the Special Envoy of the Secretary- General for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, for  his efforts to help the Syrian parties develop a constitutional foundation for the country and build on the positive outcomes of the talks in Geneva, Astana and  Sochi  so as to stop the war, achieve national reconciliation and end the conflict. We hope that the joint efforts and cooperation that we are now seeing in Syria and other places of conflict will continue.\nMy country welcomes the positive developments in the Horn of Africa and the understandings reached by States in the region. They should result in restoring confidence and ending disputes. We welcome the efforts of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the key role played by his country in helping to achieve security and stability in the Horn of Africa region.\nIn conclusion, my country renews its call on all countries of the world to adhere to the principles of  the Charter of the United Nations and international law and resolve their differences by peaceful means, that is, without resorting to war, in the light of war\u2019s tragic consequences, so as to ensure that the peoples of the world can enjoy security, stability, development and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to express my heartfelt congratulations to Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on being elected President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I pledge my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation in the discharge of her heavy responsibilities.\nToday we are living in a flat, globalized and interrelated world. Our life is digitalized to a great extent, and our way of life is greatly shaped by technological progress. In spite of such developments, we encounter a plethora of global flashpoints, including conflicts, poverty, hunger and inequality. I am therefore glad to represent my Government in this general debate, which will deliberate issues relating to making the United Nations more relevant to all people and making the world more peaceful, equitable and sustainable.\nOver the past 73 years, the United Nations has reached out to and assisted every Member State as part of its diligent activities to promote peace, justice and global understanding. Accordingly, under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is timely for the United Nations to endeavour, in line with its founding principles, to reach every individual in Member States. Mongolia appreciates the leadership that Secretary- General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has shown through his reform initiatives in reinforcing the joint efforts of Member States to leave no one behind. We support his reform initiatives in the peace and security architecture, which are aimed at ensuring  stronger  prevention  and mediation activities and making peacekeeping operations more cost-effective, as well as his initiatives aimed at repositioning the United Nations development system, which aspire to reform the United Nations so as to create a more effective, well-coordinated, transparent and accountable organization.\nAccording to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, world military expenditures are estimated to have reached $1.7 trillion in 2017. That is not only an increase over the previous year, but also the highest level of such expenditures since the end of the Cold War. The arms race shows no sign of abating, and the situations in some regions are unstable owing to deteriorating conflicts. The use of technological advancements in armed conflicts is  making  the  world situation more dangerous than ever. Mongolia\n \nhas always held the principled position that conflicts should be resolved peacefully and through dialogue. Based on our peaceful philosophy, originating in our national mentality and religious beliefs, we have always supported peace and security initiatives proposed at the General Assembly and other forums, and have striven to be a responsible member of the Organization.\nWith regard to Mongolia\u2019s initiatives aimed at demonstrating its contributions to peace and security at the global and regional  levels,  I  need  mention only the resolutions on Disarmament  Week,  which has been observed from 24 to 30 October every year since 1978; the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace, adopted in 1984; and my country\u2019s declaration as a nuclear-weapon-free State in 1992, the status of which  we  continue  to  guarantee.  Mongolians  have a saying that, \u201cIt is better to give a needle in time of need rather than to give a camel when wealthy\u201d \u2014 or, as it is said in English, \u201cA friend in need is a friend indeed\u201d. Mongolians always try to assist other nations and people when they are in need or seek peace and stability. On one such occasion, we brought hundreds of orphans from the  Democratic  People\u2019s  Republic of Korea to Mongolia following the Korean War and subsequently raised them. During past decades, we have stretched out our hands to the extent possible to  a number of countries that have faced natural disasters and terrorist acts, while rendering development assistance to countries of the region and sharing our modest experience with democratic transition.\nThis year we are celebrating the seventieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping, which has contributed immensely to world peace and security. Mongolia first joined United  Nations  peacekeeping in 2002, with the deployment of unarmed military observers, and began deploying troops in 2006. Today we are proud of our troops, who  have  been praised  by the international community for their robust, calm and appropriate approach to peacekeeping. As one of the major 30 troop-contributing countries, as well as one of the leaders in terms of troop deployment per capita, Mongolia envisages increasing its participation in United Nations peacekeeping  operations  and  fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative.\nAddressing security issues in North-East Asia is one of our foreign-policy priorities, as it has a direct impact on our security and development. Mongolia has been closely following and has welcomed recent positive\ndevelopments on the Korean peninsula, including the inter-Korean and other bilateral summits, which have provided an important impetus to confidence-building and ensuring peace and security in North-East Asia. However, we are not merely observing the process, but are also trying to contribute to it. Since the 1980s, we have been consistently pursuing the policy of launching a dialogue mechanism in North-East Asia. Those efforts yielded the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security \u2014 an international conference that has been held annually since 2014. The Dialogue is currently developing into an open and  inclusive  mechanism that brings together both Government officials and representatives from academia from all of the countries in the subregion. Discussion topics cover a broad range of issues, including security, energy, infrastructure, green development and opportunities for humanitarian cooperation, among others.\nAsia is one of the most disaster-prone regions of the world. We actively support regional cooperation for enhancing disaster resilience, reducing disaster risk and increasing the effectiveness of disaster-prevention activities. Within that framework, we have proposed an initiative to establish the Northeast Asia Disaster Risk Reduction Platform in Mongolia. The proposal was discussed at the conferences of the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security and the second Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, successfully hosted in Ulaanbaatar in July, which received warm support from the countries of the region with regard to its implementation. Mongolians believe that neighbours share the same  disposition and interests. As Mongolia is determined to develop strategic partnerships with its two big neighbours, it closely follows their initiatives at the regional  level and strives to engage with them in every possible way. We recently proposed initiatives to facilitate travel for nationals of countries along the Belt and Road corridor and proposed the Peace, Prosperity, Progress, Promise Award for junior diplomats and scholars from Belt and Road countries.\nUndoubtedly, many of the armed  conflicts, rivalries, insurgencies and terrorist attacks that trouble us today have been caused by the clash of civilizations and religions. Mongolia is one of the few nations that has had no religious or ethnic wars in its history. The great Mongolian Empire, established 812 years ago, was governed by a written and codified law, and it was a genuine home of religious freedom, where Christians,\n \nMuslims, Confucians and Buddhists were treated equally and lived together without any ideological struggle. In brief, the legacy of  religious  tolerance and respect in the Mongolian Empire, which covered an immense swathe of territory, is very instructive for today\u2019s world. More recently, during the era of the Cold War in the twentieth century, we carried out specific activities aimed at bringing together the voices of international Buddhists to support world peace through the Asian Buddhist Conference for Peace (ABCP), which was established in 1969 and has achieved tangible results in combating ideological divisions.\nWe perceive a pressing need today for effective dialogue mechanisms, such as the ABCP, which enjoys consultative status in the Economic and Social Council. We are therefore determined to revitalize its activities at the regional and international levels. In that regard, as a regional hub connecting North-East and Central Asian countries, we are announcing, from this rostrum, our initiative to host the Conference on Religious Freedom in Mongolia in March 2019. We are confident that our initiative will contribute constructively to new developments in the culture of peace and religious tolerance and freedom worldwide.\nMongolia was one of the early adopters of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the national level, with the adoption of its own Sustainable Development Vision 2030 in February 2016. In accordance with its Vision, by 2030 Mongolia aspires to consolidate its democratic governance, preserve ecological balance, eradicate poverty in all its forms and rank among the upper-middle-income countries. My Government has been taking important steps to ensure coherence between the SDGs and the national development policies that have been implemented previously and translate them into short- and medium- term plans and programmes. In order to provide financing for development, an investment programme has been adopted in line with the Government action plan. Moreover, SDG indicators  were  developed based on multi-stakeholder consultations and will be adopted shortly.\nMongolia has witnessed an economic resurgence with accelerated foreign-trade turnover, increased investment and a budget surplus over the past two years. However, Mongolian economic growth, which is highly dependent on mining and vulnerable to commodity prices, tends to be unstable and risky in terms of ensuring the allocation of financial resources for the\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in years of commodity-price decline. Moreover, another challenge faced by my Government involves ensuring that every citizen benefits from economic growth. For instance, following the recent economic growth, unemployment, but not poverty, decreased modestly. We are therefore introducing measures aimed at reducing income disparities and poverty into all relevant Government programmes and sectoral plans, while compiling a comprehensive database of low-income households and supporting public-private partnerships. In order to resolve issues comprehensively, the national programme on reducing poverty and unemployment will be launched shortly.\nThis year we are celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2014 a milestone document in the history of human rights. In accordance with the ideals enshrined in the Declaration, Mongolia has made remarkable progress in the area of the promotion and protection of human rights. In recent years particular importance has been attached to the issues of enhancing gender equality, protecting the rights of children, the elderly and persons with disabilities, combating human trafficking and drugs, and ensuring freedom of speech and expression. For the period from 2016 to 2018, Mongolia has been serving as a member of the Human Rights Council for the first time. It has been an honour for us to contribute to global endeavours to protect and promote human rights. Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set  forth in  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized.\nFollowing the 2016 New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, Member States have continued working constructively on  the  issue  of  migration. We expect that the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration will be adopted in Marrakesh, Morocco, in December on the historic day marking the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and will serve as a valuable document in terms of ensuring the protection of the rights of all migrants. The world has witnessed the highest level of population displacement ever over the past two decades. That phenomenon has not spared my country, which has a small population and is located in the highlands of North-East Asia.\nWe are experiencing a high volume of internal and external migration for a number of reasons, including\n \nunemployment and poverty. Owing to a large number of citizens who have been moving from the countryside to cities since the 1990s, as of 2017 45 per cent of our total population lives in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, with a net annual growth of 22.3 per cent. The social ramifications include poverty, unemployment, poor access to health-care services and a high level of air pollution in the capital city as compared with other areas. The citizens of Mongolia are highly educated. The fact that the second-largest portion of the 2018 State budget has been allocated to the education sector demonstrates the Government\u2019s firm commitment to prioritize human-resource development. However, access to schools and the quality of education has not always kept pace with demographic growth, rates of urbanization and modern education standards. While the pupil-to-classroom ratio in schools and kindergartens has decreased together with the population density in rural areas, the opposite is true in urban centres. It was troubling for me to hear at one of my public meetings in Ulaanbaatar last year that the 10-year-old child of a citizen had to walk home at 9 p.m. through dark winter streets, as the temperature dropped to between -20\u00b0C and -25\u00b0C on his way back home after the third shift of his school, which does not provide bus service.\nThe Government of Mongolia is planning and implementing policies and programmes that aim, by 2030, to address effectively the challenges faced by living in the capital, including kindergarten shortages, the fact that approximately 30 suburban schools must operate in three shifts, the overloading of family hospitals and the adverse affects of air pollution on people\u2019s health, as well as the issue of unemployed people in Ulaanbaatar, who account for one third of the nation\u2019s unemployed. Furthermore, approximately 5 per cent of our total working-age population is working abroad, and that percentage is increasing. We therefore need to take comprehensive measures to resolve issues pertaining to their health care, social insurance and dual citizenship, and improve the related legal environment.\nClimate change is yet another daunting challenge for humankind today, along with peace, security and development issues. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change has been ratified by 179 countries. However, the implementation rate is not living up to expectations, and the fulfilment of shared responsibilities by States Members remains insufficient. We therefore welcome and support the Secretary-General\u2019s timely initiative to convene the United Nations 2019 Climate Summit\nfor reviewing the Paris Agreement commitments. Global warming  and climate change impact all nations, and they are felt more intensely in the context of the economic and social development of the least- developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small  island  developing  States.  In  that  regard, I would like to highlight that, through the initiative and leadership of Mongolia, the International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries has been established in Ulaanbaatar and became fully operational in May. The International Think Tank \u2014 the first- ever intergovernmental organization representing the 32 landlocked developing countries \u2014 will carry out policy research and implement feasible projects to address common challenges and protect the interests and positions of those countries with the purpose of augmenting their ability to benefit from international trade. I am confident that members will continue their cooperation and support for the activities of the Think Tank, as they have done in the past.\nIn Mongolia, where extreme weather conditions prevail and the economy mostly relies on mining and agriculture, the scope, frequency and negative impact of disasters \u2014 such as earthquakes, desertification, soil erosion and forest fires \u2014 have increased in recent years. I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that, during United Nations Climate Week, my delegation will be screening a documentary entitled Blue Gold. We are sharing that documentary with members not only to show the devastating impact of climate change in Mongolia, but also to sound the alarm about similar consequences elsewhere and appeal for timely protective steps to be taken.\nIn conclusion, I would like to call, from this United Nations rostrum, for unity among all nations in a spirit of mutual trust and awareness of our responsibilities for the sake not only of the current but also of future generations, as well as to strive for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my great honour to deliver this statement on behalf of  His  Excellency Mr. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President  of  the  Republic of South Sudan, who unfortunately could not be here today owing to his engagement in consolidating and streamlining the implementation of the peace process. I would also like to congratulate the President on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session and on being the fourth woman to hold that position. The Republic of South Sudan affirms its commitment to playing its role in supporting the implementation of the agenda she has proposed for this historic session.\nOn behalf of the people of the Republic of South Sudan and my Government, I would like to reiterate our heartfelt condolences to the entire United Nations family and to the family of the late former Secretary- General His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, who recently passed away. He played a crucial role in supporting the people of the Republic of South Sudan by ensuring that we peace, which was instrumental in the formation of the Republic of South Sudan.\nIn addition, I was happy to attend the centenary commemoration of the late Madiba (see A/73/PV.4 et seq.). It is fitting that the United Nations has dedicated\n24 September to the annual holding of the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit. He was an icon of peace whose legacy will live forever.\nThe theme selected by the President for this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, resonates very well with the vision of the Republic of South Sudan for peace and prosperity. At this juncture, I would like to share with members some of the successes that we have achieved on our long walk to peace and prosperity.\nI stood before the General Assembly last year (see A/72/PV.19) as the First Vice-President of a country  in the middle of violent conflict. I stand before the Assembly today in testament to what  Members  of this Organization have helped achieve in the Republic of South Sudan, especially the relevant specialized United Nations bodies operating in our country, along with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the African Union (AU), the European Union, the Troika, China, the IGAD Partners Forum and the international partners and friends of South Sudan. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that we now have a more united Republic of South Sudan, heading towards peaceful stability. With the continued support and goodwill of our regional and international partners, we are on schedule to hold free and fair general elections after a transitional period of 36 months.\n \nThe path leading towards that agreement began at the thirty-first Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads of State and Government, held on 12 June 2017 in Addis Ababa on the situation in the Republic of South Sudan. The Heads of State and Government agreed on the need for the establishment of a high-level revitalization forum for all of the parties to the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. That process includes new stakeholders and various groups, including civil society, women\u2019s groups, religious leaders, young people and eminent persons as observers. The purpose of the High-level Revitalization Forum, as stated at the Extraordinary Summit, was threefold: first, to institute a permanent ceasefire; secondly, to give fresh impetus to the inclusive implementation of the provisions of the peace agreement; and thirdly, to agree on a realistic new timeline and implementation schedule for the holding of democratic elections at the end of the transitional period.\nThe Government of the Republic of South Sudan unreservedly embraced the IGAD-led High-level Revitalization Forum. Its objectives were crystal clear, and the delegation of the Government of the Republic of South Sudan attended the meetings of the Forum fully prepared to take advantage of every opportunity to achieve comprehensive and lasting peace. The thirty- second Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads of State and Government on the situation in the Republic of South Sudan entrusted His Excellency Field Marshal Omer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir, President of the Republic of the Sudan, to facilitate a second round of face-to-face discussions with His Excellency General Salva Kiir Mayardit, Mr. Riek Machar and other political leaders to resolve the outstanding issues pertaining to the governance and security arrangements emerging from the Revitalization Forum.\nThe signing of the Khartoum Declaration of Agreement between the Parties to the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan took place on 27 June. General Salva Kiir Mayardit and Mr. Riek Machar, together with other political leaders, approved under that agreement: first, the declaration of a permanent ceasefire throughout South Sudan, based on the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement signed on 21 December  2017;  secondly, the adoption of security arrangements to build one national army, a police force and other security organs of an inclusive character; and thirdly, the conclusion of an agreement on the revised bridging proposal before the closure of the Khartoum round of talks. On\n12 September, all of the parties \u2014 the Transitional Government of National Unity, the Sudanese People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Sudanese People\u2019s Liberation Army in Opposition, the South Sudan Opposition Alliance, former detainees, other political parties and other stakeholders with regard to the original peace Agreement \u2014 signed the final Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of South Sudan in Addis Ababa. The signing was graciously attended and witnessed by the IGAD Heads of State and Government, the international community, the African Union, the European Union, the United Nations, the Troika, China, the IGAD Partners Forum and international partners and friends of the Republic of South Sudan.\nIn addition to the recently signed Revitalized Peace Agreement, since December 2015  we  have been working on a national dialogue and grass-roots people-to-people peace initiatives. It is our belief that such a complementary three-track approach is the only way to consolidate the efforts for peace on the ground, as well as to ensure the restoration of accountability and the upholding of human rights in my country. In South Sudan\u2019s unique environment, a multilayered approach such as the one adopted by my Government is the best way forward.\nIt is therefore against that background that the Transitional Government of National Unity has embraced the full implementation of the peace Agreement as the only instrument crucial to achieving that mission and vision. The Government of the Republic of South Sudan is ready to welcome forces from the guarantors of the Revitalized Agreement to monitor its implementation and encourages IGAD and the AU to discuss with the Security Council how the Regional Protection Force can help to monitor and ensure that peace holds in the Republic of South Sudan. With regard to security-sector reforms, which are a major pillar of the Revitalized Agreement, my Government reiterates its commitment and resolve to implement transitional security arrangements encompassing a range of security-sector reforms, including the cantonment of forces. Moreover, the Government is committed to transforming the Sudan Peoples\u2019 Liberation Army, and its structures are already in place to achieve the aim of creating a professional national army.\nI am very pleased to inform the Assembly of the formation of the National Pre-Transitional Committee, which is made up of all of the stakeholders who will\n \nbe entrusted with the functions of overseeing and coordinating the implementation of the peace agreement activities during the pretransitional period.\nThe achievement of lasting peace requires establishing mechanisms to tackle impunity and ensure accountability. In the recently decided Terrain Hotel case, the Government interviewed victims in order to be able to hold the responsible individuals accountable. A detailed investigation formula and evidence-gathering process, carried out with the support of the United States Government through the Federal Bureau of Investigation, enabled the victims to identify their attackers and enabled the prosecution of those responsible to the full extent of the law. Since the eruption of the conflict in December 2013, the court martial has tried 204 cases, including the Terrain Hotel case. The Terrain  Hotel  trials  demonstrated the commitment of the Sudanese People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Sudanese People\u2019s Liberation Army in Opposition to holding its members to account for their crimes, including abuse of civilians.\nIt goes without saying that war has blighted the economy of the Republic of South Sudan. We have seen tremendous losses of life, property and human dignity. No report affects my heart as much as the sight of our young and infirm dying needlessly and suffering from deprivation. Indeed, I have been asked specifically why my Government believes that this time peace is permanent. There is an African proverb that advises a person to look at the place where he slipped, because there he will find what made him fall.\nIt is through a change of leaders\u2019 attitudes from entrenched  positions  that  we  have  moved   towards a conciliatory and accommodating Government of National Unity. My President, Mr. Kiir Mayardit, has compromised on many positions and worked with more stakeholders for the sake of peace. The IGAD-led peace initiatives have demonstrated the way in which African solutions to African problems can lead to an agreement. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to IGAD, the Republic of the Sudan in particular, and the broader international community for the critical roles they played, without which the Revitalized Peace Agreement would not have happened.\nIn that regard, given the positive role being played by the Republic of the Sudan in the peace process in South Sudan and the region, we appeal for a speedy\nnormalization of the relationship between the Sudan and the United States of America. Moreover, we call for the total lifting of the sanctions against the Sudan.\nWe urge the Government of the Sudan to find a speedy resolution to the contentious issues in the Blue Nile, Southern Kordofan and Darfur regions, based on our strong belief that stability in those areas is critical for total and lasting peace in South Sudan and the Sudan, as well as the region as a whole.\nOn Abyei, as we await the settlement of its final status, the Government of South Sudan reiterates its support for the recommendations of the Secretary- General in his letter to  the  Security Council dated   20 August (S/2018/776). We also commend the good work of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) and remain grateful to Ethiopia, the sole UNISFA troop contributor.\nWe also urge Member States to continue supporting efforts at the level of the African Union to find a political solution to the problem of Abyei. We call especially for the implementation of the 21 September 2012 proposal of the AU High-Level Implementation Panel for the Sudan and former President Mbeki, which has been endorsed more than six times to date by the AU Peace and Security Council. It is high time that we brought an end to the suffering of the Ngok Dinka people.\nConflict by itself can also be a vehicle for positive change, if we are aware of where we have come from, where we are now and where we are going. As brothers and sisters, we have hurt each other. As we seek national healing,  President   Kiir  Mayardit   has   empowered a cross-section of community representatives and mediators to set up national dialogue and other grass- roots people-to-people peace initiatives.\nThe national dialogue was launched to create a multilayered approach to repairing the social fabric. It has been heavily criticized by some external observers, mainly because of a misconception that it was considered a substitute for peace talks. At the launch of the national dialogue in 2015, its aim was to create a forum in which the causes of conflict could be discussed and, among other things, to ask the people important questions about matters such as national identity, governance and the relationship between the communities, including the causes of intercommunal conflict.\nThe grass-roots component has been the most effective. Members of the committee visited regions,\n \nstarting at the community level, asking questions designed to identify the causes of division while also searching for solutions to those divisions and how to heal them. The process enabled those who  had not  had an opportunity to have their voices heard to begin expressing their various viewpoints. The reports from the grass-roots initiatives were candid, as communities were allowed to express their opinions freely without fear of repercussions. We look forward to seeing the next steps of that process as we enter the transitional period.\nAs we work to make the United Nations relevant  to all people through global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, I would like to reiterate that my Government welcomes the presence and support of United Nations agencies. However, the terms of that relationship need to be reconsidered, specifically when it comes to protecting vulnerable citizens in the host country. It is only through a reflective approach that we can move forward in adapting the nature of this institution to make it fit for today\u2019s environment.\nLast but not least, as I speak of reviving peace in the Republic of South Sudan, it is only right to mention the late former President John F. Kennedy, who said in an address to the Assembly on 20 September 1963:\n\u201cPeace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually  changing  opinions,  slowly  eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures.\u201d (A/PV.1209, para.38)\nI call on members of the United Nations family, including those who are sceptical, to give peace a chance in the Republic of South Sudan by supporting the critical implementation phase of the peace agreement. South Sudan will continue its cooperation with the United Nations, the regional bodies, IGAD, the East African Community, the AU, the EU, the Troika, China, other international partners  and  all our friends as we work to enhance conditions in our country. We undertake to consolidate peace and justice, rebuild strong institutions in our country and stabilize our economy.\nWe call on all Member States as partners to support, cooperate, consult and engage in dialogue with us as we join together in achieving the agenda  for making the United Nations relevant to all people through global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. That is our agenda, too.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, allow me to give thanks to Almighty God, who has enabled us to meet in the magnificent city of New York, which is hosting the seventy-third session of the General Assembly of our Organization.\nAllow me also to offer the President the sincerest greetings of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of Burundi, who was unable to make the trip to New York and has honoured me with the task of representing him. My delegation would like to add its voice to all those who  preceded it  in this forum to extend to Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s our warm and heartfelt congratulations on her brilliant election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. As the fourth woman to assume that position out of 73 Presidents of the General Assembly, we have no doubt that she will utilize her feminine touch to make this session a resounding success. Naturally, she can count on Burundi\u2019s full support and cooperation throughout her term.\nMy delegation also takes this opportunity to pay a fitting tribute to her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for leading the work of the seventy-second session and helping us to achieve such brilliant results. We also thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for the commendable actions he has already undertaken in the short time since he assumed his role at the helm of our Organization.\nMy delegation is deeply saddened by the death of the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His death is an irreparable loss for all Africans and the entire United Nations family. We pay tribute to him for\n \nhis tireless work and dedication to the cause of world\npeace and development.\nMy delegation welcomes the choice of the central theme of this session, namely, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. That is a timely theme, as the fragmentation and polarization of the world threatens the multilateralism that we desire and which is based on respect for the rule of law and the sharing of responsibilities in managing global issues.\nFor most of my statement, I will focus on the general situation in my country, Burundi, before addressing the current global challenges, whose solutions require concerted responses. At the political level, on May 17 Burundi organized a constitutional referendum, which proceeded in a calm and orderly manner. That event was preceded by very broad consultations with the population, which enabled them to express themselves in all their rich political, ethnic, regional and gender diversity \u2014 and in complete transparency \u2014 regarding the content of the new basic law.\nMember States will recall that, when the new Constitution was enacted on 7 June, the President of the Republic of Burundi informed citizens and the international community that his second term of office would end in 2020 and that he was ready to support the new President, who will be elected that year. Contrary to the discourse of some who had claimed that his intentions were to shape the new Constitution for his own benefit and to remain in power until 2034, that gesture of high political and democratic value on the part of our President sets a welcome example.\nAlso at the political level, it would not be superfluous to underline that the spirit of tolerance, transparency and openness of the political space is continually being strengthened in Burundi. That is evidenced by the return and reintegration of the several thousand refugees and political leaders who had fled the country and who can now enjoy their civil and political rights without any hindrance. The liberation of more than 2,000 prisoners at the beginning of the year also formed part of that dynamic of reconciliation, social cohesion and political tolerance in the country.\nWith regard to the inter-Burundian dialogue, my delegation notes that dialogue as a means of finding peaceful solutions to political disputes has become part of our culture. Those who ask us to promote dialogue\nare pounding on a door that is already open. In addition to the very commendable efforts of the East African Community, Burundi has the Permanent Forum of Political Parties \u2014 an excellent platform for dialogue among approved political parties in Burundi. It is within that framework that all political parties met in the north of Burundi on 3 August to informally discuss the important issues of the 2020 elections. The meeting resulted in the adoption by more than 20 political parties of a road map for free, inclusive and peaceful elections in 2020. The Independent National Electoral Commission, in accordance with the new Constitution, was also set up recently with due consideration given to the need to respect political, ethnic, regional and gender inclusiveness.\nRegional dynamics are continuing normally. We have reached out to contacts at the highest level since the beginning of the year. Nearby, at the beginning of this month, the former President of Tanzania and facilitator of the inter-Burundian dialogue, Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, sent his team to Burundi for constructive consultations with all stakeholders in the country with a view to organizing the fifth and final round of the inter-Burundian dialogue in preparation for free, transparent and peaceful elections in 2020.\nOn the security front, the situation in Burundi is calm, stable and fully under control, with the exception of a few cases of common-law crime. That positive observation was echoed by subregional organizations as well as by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Burundi and the Security Council in the 9 August briefing (see S/PV.8325) and the press statement of\n22 August (SC/13461), respectively. That return to normalcy in the country made it possible, among  other things, to hold the constitutional referendum without major incident, to accommodate a massive return of refugees and political leaders, to host several conferences at the regional and continental levels, and to host foreign dignitaries visiting Burundi.\nWith regard to the return of refugees, I am pleased to inform you that since 2016, more than 206,000 refugees have returned voluntarily to Burundi \u2014 including 100,000 who decided to return in 2016; 168,000 who returned to their families from January to August 2017; and 38,254 who have returned since the August 2017 tripartite agreement between Burundi, Tanzania and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). That voluntary return of refugees is continuing at a satisfactory pace. However,\n \nmy delegation would like to reiterate its request to UNHCR and friends in the region to intervene because some host countries are holding our exiled fellow countrymen hostage by erecting  artificial  obstacles to their voluntary return home. We also ask UNHCR to ensure that refugee camps maintain their civilian character, in accordance with the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and Security Council resolution 2389 (2017) of 8 December on the Great Lakes region.\nIn that same vein, Burundi reiterates its urgent appeal to all countries that host, support and maintain the fugitive rebels of 13 May 2015 to extradite them to Burundi so that they can be held accountable for their actions before the courts. Their long-awaited extradition would be a major contribution to the strengthening of the democratic principles advocated by the Charter of the United Nations and a clear rejection of any attempt to gain power by unconstitutional and violent means.\nWith regard to human rights, Burundi reiterates its readiness to work and cooperate with other nations and the United Nations on the promotion of the protection of human rights in Burundi and elsewhere in the world, in accordance with the rules established by the Charter of the United Nations. That noble mission will be possible only through mutually respectful cooperation, frank and sincere dialogue among Member States and the use of mechanisms accepted by all, such as the Universal Periodic Review. The dangerous trend of some States to attempt to transform the Human Rights Council into a tool for political  pressure and  the  regulation  of geopolitics in the South risks compromising the objectives set by Member States when the  Council was created in 2006. The drift towards the excessive politicization of human rights and the policies of selectivity and double standards run contrary to the principles of the universality and indivisibility of human rights.\nThe withdrawal of some countries from the Human Rights Council should not be interpreted as a negative act. Rather, it is a momentary disavowal of the dysfunction and almost exclusive control of that body by a minority of States. For its part, the Government of Burundi remains more committed than ever to the promotion of human rights in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 60/251, of 15 March 2006, establishing the Human Rights Council. Dialogue and cooperation based on mutual respect form\nthe cornerstone of the Government of Burundi\u2019s policy on the promotion of human rights.\nWith regard to cooperation with the United Nations, Burundi is proud to participate actively and successfully in United Nations and African Union (AU) peace missions. More than 6,000 Burundian men and women are deployed in the various peacekeeping operations, mainly in the Central African Republic and Somalia. The excellent work of our brave soldiers on peace missions, who have voluntarily chosen to sacrifice their very lives in saving the lives of others far from their homeland and in particularly difficult conditions, must be duly appreciated and commended. In order to demonstrate its growing interest in peacekeeping, Burundi is proud to have joined other nations in renewing its international commitment during the Action for Peacekeeping high-level meeting held on 25 September.\nWith regard to Burundi\u2019s presence on the Security Council\u2019s agenda, my delegation would like to reiterate its strong appeal to the Council to have the courage to remove Burundi from its agenda. It should be noted that the current political and security situation in the country is calm, stable and fully under control. It is far from posing a threat to international peace and security, which is the Security Council\u2019s field of expertise. The precious time that the Council allocates to discussing Burundi should be devoted to the other areas of tension and conflicts that are raging now. Burundi today should not be an item on the agenda of the Security Council. We need instead the attention of the United Nations agencies tasked with socioeconomic development in order to boost our economic recovery.\nThe implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains a priority for Burundi. The Government of Burundi has just adopted a 10-year plan, the Burundi national development plan 2018-2027. The plan aims to restore the structural balance of the Burundian economy through the strengthening of food self-sufficiency and export diversification through the promotion of agro- industrial, commercial and extractive enterprises. We need to develop the energy and craft sectors, build and maintain infrastructure to support growth, improve access to basic social services, including education, health and social protection, continue environmental and regional planning programmes, improve financial governance and decentralization, and develop regional and international partnerships. The Government of\n \nBurundi therefore calls on all bilateral and multilateral partners to consider those goals in their projects aimed at supporting the Burundian people and helping us to implement our plan.\nWith regard to the unilateral economic sanctions that the European Union\u2019s partners have imposed on Burundi in the aftermath of the 2015 election fever, my delegation would like to inform the international community that the context in which those sanctions were imposed has fundamentally changed. My delegation also notes that, following the undisputed return of peace and security to the country, the AU Summit of Heads of State and Government, held in early July in Mauritania, adopted a resolution calling on the European Union to lift the unjust and immoral sanctions against Burundi. At the end of its meeting  in New York on 25 September, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union issued a communiqu\u00e9 reiterating the call of the  previous  AU  Summit  to lift politically motivated sanctions in order to create conditions that would foster socioeconomic recovery in the country. On the same occasion, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union welcomed the return of peace and stability to Burundi.\nWith regard to global challenges, Burundi believes that migration issues must be resolved in a constructive and concerted manner among all Member States. Burundi fully supports the ongoing process within the Organization we share to adopt, in December 2018 in Marrakech, Morocco, a global pact for safe, regular and orderly migration.\nWe cannot ignore that climate change is an existential threat to the economic, social and sustainable development of Africa and beyond. Without immediate and coordinated action, it will be much more difficult and costly to adapt to the future consequences of those changes. Each State member of the Organization must urgently respect its freely made commitments within the framework of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In the same vein, developed countries must honour their commitments to finance the adaptation of Southern economies to the effects of global warming.\nThe SDGs are a call to action for all poor, rich and middle-income countries to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. In order to achieve the 17 Goals that we set ourselves in 2015, two factors are needed \u2014 the political will of all leaders of Member States and the availability of adequate and predictable\nfunding. Particular attention should be paid to supporting the efforts of the most vulnerable countries, such as the least developed countries, landlocked countries, small island developing States and countries in post-conflict situations.\nThe quest for peace and stability concerns us all. In that regard, we welcome the recent progress made in the search for sustainable African solutions to African problems. We welcome the new positive developments for peace in South Sudan and the positive changes in the Horn of Africa. We welcome the fact that those new peace initiatives coincide with the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace that we adopted in the political declaration of 24 September (resolution 73/1) in this very Hall.\nThe lack of a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the current status quo  are contributing  to insecurity and destabilization in the Middle East. The international community must  mobilize to  find  a comprehensive resolution to that conflict, which is more than 50 years old. Burundi supports the vision of a region where two States, Israel and Palestine, would live side by side, within secure and recognized borders, in peace and mutual respect, in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is the only viable solution.\nWith  regard to the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, Burundi will remain committed,  alongside   other   nations,   to   playing   a leading role in the common struggle to  build  a world free of acts of terrorism. However, we remain convinced that, beyond the necessary military action, an effective fight against terrorism requires combating radicalization, which is fuelled by ignorance, poverty, youth unemployment, illiteracy, injustice, humiliation and exclusion, which provide terrorism with the ideal prey and all it needs in order to materialize and spread before our eyes.\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to note from this rostrum that the realities and demands of the current world require us to adapt our global governance to the new challenges of our ever-changing  world. That leads us to point out that the revitalization of the General Assembly and the long-awaited reform of the Security Council are becoming increasingly pressing issues if we want a United Nations that can effectively meet the legitimate expectations of all  nations.  In that regard, Burundi reaffirms its commitment to\n \nthe Common African Position on Security Council reform,  as contained  in  the  Ezulwini  Consensus.  It is time to redress the historical injustice done to Africa, the only continent that is not represented in the permanent membership category and one that is also underrepresented in the non-permanent membership category of the Security Council.\n"

        "file_text": "I am very honoured to deliver this statement during the general debate of the General Assembly at the beginning of its seventy-third session, whose theme has been chosen as \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d.\nI should like to congratulate Ms. Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I believe that this session will be a great success under her leadership. I would also like to express my appreciation for the very important initiatives that Secretary-General Guterres has championed since taking office.\nMay I also, on behalf of the Government and people of Viet Nam, express my sincere gratitude to the General Assembly for the minute of silence observed in memory of the late President of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, who recently passed.\nHumankind has still not forgotten the scourge of the two World Wars of the twentieth century. However, since the birth of the United Nations in 1945, world wars have become a thing of the past. The foundations of peace on our planet have continued to be reinforced thanks to the efforts of the United Nations, the largest\nmultilateral organization where the  largest  number  of countries meet. Over the past 70 years, the United Nations has played an enormous role through its tireless efforts to preserve peace, prevent conflicts and wars and realize the purposes and principles of the Organization as codified in the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe have seen significant achievements in recent years in global cooperation and development, ranging from the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons to reforms of the United Nations, the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in 2015 and the adoption and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe United Nations has also been vital in efforts to address global issues, including reducing poverty, protecting women and children, promoting human rights, improving health care, culture and education, preserving the environment and responding to climate change. Today the  United  Nations  has truly become a symbol of global solidarity, the embodiment of humankind and progress and the place where our aspirations for a world of peace, prosperity and equality are realized.\nViet Nam has been a companion to the United Nations and contributed to the noble goals pursued by the Organization over the past 70 years. We are a staunch supporter of the central role of the United Nations in the multilateral international system and have actively joined in efforts to realize its fundamental cooperation pillars \u2014 the maintenance of global peace and security, development cooperation and the protection and promotion of human rights.\nOnce a poor, underdeveloped country with a food deficit, over the past 20 years Viet Nam has recorded average annual gross domestic product growth of more than 6 per cent to become one of the world\u2019s largest food exporters. Since 2010, we have been a middle-income developing country, and the living standards of our nearly 100 million citizens have improved dramatically. By actively engaging in international  integration,  Viet Nam enjoys free trading relations with nearly 60 major countries and partners in the world through its membership of 16 free trade agreements.\nMost recently, we successfully hosted the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation throughout 2017, the 132nd  Assembly  of  the  Inter-Parliamentary  Union in 2015, the 2018 World Economic Forum on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\n \nand the sixth Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperation Summit in 2018. We are also working towards the ASEAN Community Vision 2025, which aims to strengthen ASEAN centrality in the evolving regional architecture. Viet Nam has also taken the initiative and taken part in many important United Nations mechanisms, contributing responsibly in many different areas.\nViet Nam is also making greater efforts to promote justice and sustainable development, foster equality and support for disadvantaged groups, protect the environment and ensure rights for all citizens, while upholding a spirit  of  dialogue  and  cooperation  in the area of human rights. We have always attached importance to preserving cultural and natural heritage and national identity. We are one of the few countries to have accomplished many of the Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule, particularly for poverty reduction.\nWe have made it our consistent policy to uphold the Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental principles of international law with regard to the settlement of international disputes through peaceful means. That includes in the South China Sea, where there are issues that should be addressed on the basis of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the need to safeguard maritime security and safety and the freedom of navigation and overflight.\nCooperation and assistance from the international community, including the United Nations, has been extremely valuable for Viet Nam in its efforts to achieve sustainable development, international integration and poverty reduction. On this occasion, I would like, on behalf of the Vietnamese Government and people, to express my sincere gratitude to the United Nations and all countries and international organizations that have lent their active and effective assistance to Viet Nam.\nOur planet is experiencing rapid change, propelled by the scientific and technological breakthroughs of the fourth industrial revolution as well as the irreversible trend of globalization. That opens up a range of new opportunities to guide humankind into a new era of economic growth unprecedented in the history of our civilization, further bolstering the main global currents of peace, cooperation and development.\nYet the world is also facing immense new challenges. World peace has yet to be guaranteed, although the situation on the Korean peninsula has\nseen new progress. In the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere, conflict, or the threat of conflict, is ongoing, and immigration remains a pressing matter for many countries. Power politics, the use or threat of force and the rise of unilateral measures continue to pose threats to international peace and stability. Injustice and inequality remain in many parts of the world. Risks and instabilities are ever-present in global development. The effects of climate change and environmental pollution are widespread. Poverty is still a major  challenge, with nearly 750 million people still living in extreme poverty, among whom are many children suffering from hunger and deprivation without access to health care or proper education.\nNo single nation, regardless of its might or wealth, can single-handedly address those enormous global challenges. They require the common efforts and collaboration of all nations. I would like to suggest that a concept of dual responsibility should be universally upheld. Each nation should take additional responsibility for addressing global issues, and each individual should take additional responsibility as a global citizen.\nAgainst that backdrop, I share Secretary-General Guterres\u2019s view that the role of the  United  Nations has become all the  more  important in  the  creation of new foundations for more effectively addressing global challenges. We must continue highlighting the role of the United Nations and join hands for a  world of peace, equality and sustainable development. In that process, it is my hope that the major Powers and developed countries will take meaningful action to play an exemplary role in maintaining peace and fostering development. The General Assembly should be the heart of cooperation among countries and peoples for peace, equality and sustainable development.\nIn that connection, we support lifting the unilateral embargo on Cuba, so that nation can exercise its freedom to participate equitably and fairly in economic and trading relations in accordance with international law.\nPeace, freedom and prosperity have always been the desire and aspiration of all peoples. In the age of the fourth industrial revolution, humankind\u2019s progress is measured not only by feats of technological advancement but first and foremost by peace and prosperity. Even the smallest opportunity for peace must be cherished and nurtured. From its long struggle for freedom and independence, Viet Nam has a profound understanding of the value of peace, equality, self-determination, the\n \nright to the pursuit of happiness and the democratic values extolled by the Charter of the United Nations. The voices of small nations and the aspirations of the disadvantaged must be respected, heard and shared. That is the foundation for a sustainable and inclusive development that leaves no one behind. That is the foundation for social stability, which is needed to ensure the rights of every person and harness their creativity.\nToday it  is  vital that the United Nations engage in strong and comprehensive reforms, improving its effectiveness, democracy and transparency, so as to better fulfil its indispensable role in leading efforts to address global challenges. As quoted by the Secretary- General in his opening remarks (see A/73/PV.6), the late Secretary-General Kofi Annan once said:\n\u201c[W]e share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.\u201d (see SG/SM/7262)\nThat is also the reason why, immediately after the establishment of the Vietnamese State on 2 September 1945, the beloved late President of the Vietnamese people, Ho Chi Minh, submitted a request for membership of the United Nations in January 1946.\nI ask now  what we  want the United Nations to be. In answering that question, we must applaud the reform proposals that Secretary-General Guterres  has initiated, particularly on repositioning the United Nations development system. I propose that the United Nations strengthen cooperation with the various regions of the world, particularly in terms of United Nations- ASEAN high-level cooperation mechanisms, which further highlight the role of the United Nations within ASEAN and vice versa.\nViet Nam takes pride in being an active member of the United Nations. Ours is a foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development, and multilateralism and diversification in our foreign relations, as well as active and engaged international integration. With that policy, we hope to make greater contributions to the creation of multilateral mechanisms and the fulfilment of the common responsibilities of the international community. For instance, Viet Nam has dispatched a level-2 field hospital to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan.\nMore recently, Viet Nam has submitted its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. I would like\nto express my heartfelt gratitude to the 53 countries of the Asia-Pacific States Group for endorsing Viet Nam as the sole candidate of the Group, and to many others for their extensive support for our candidature so far. In this most prestigious forum, I would like, on behalf of the Vietnamese Government and people, to call for, and very much hope to receive, the support of all Member States. Viet Nam is committed to being an active and responsible member of the international community and the United Nations.\nWe have  every  reason  to  believe  that  given  our global partnership, solidarity and high level of commitment, the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will succeed, showing that we can live up to the aspirations of all humankind for a world of peace, equality and sustainable development. In that spirit, may the seventy-third session of the General Assembly be a resounding success.\n"

        "file_text": "The General Assembly is meeting this week as we mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Nelson Mandela of South Africa and as we mourn the recent death of Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations. They were two great leaders from Africa,whose personal commitment to the values and principles of multilateralism was unwavering \u2014 something that we should reflect upon and, I hope, draw inspiration from, particularly at a time of global instability and of open challenges to the very approach to the global decision-making process that has been the foundation of this institution. Ireland was honoured to have been asked to co-facilitate the consultative process with Member States to produce the political declaration adopted at the Mandela Peace Summit (resolution 73/1) on Monday. Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan were revered and loved in my country. In order to do justice to their legacy, we must renew our efforts to actively work for a culture of peace, tolerance and respect for human dignity globally. Is that not fundamentally what the United Nations should be about today? Can we not challenge ourselves  to  use the Peace Summit and this week at the General Assembly to strive, with the courage and humility that Mandela and Annan showed, for the type of world that they envisioned and fought for? In truth, we must do much better than we are currently doing to live up to the aspirations that they represented.\nGeographically, Ireland is a small island on the western edge of Europe, but in Ireland we see ourselves as an island at the centre of the world, with a global diaspora more than 10 times the size of our population at home. We have learned that, in an interdependent world, the challenges of our time do not respect geographic boundaries. Finding solutions is surely now a shared responsibility and \u2014 whether a small Polynesian island or a super-Power \u2014 we all breathe the same air. That sense of shared responsibility guides Ireland\u2019s view of the world and the part that we are trying to play in it. Almost a century ago, Ireland became an independent State, thereby escaping a history of colonialism. Ours is hardly a unique story, but it is one that I hope allows us in Ireland to empathize with so many of the countries represented in this Hall. Like the United Nations itself, we were born out of conflict. It has shaped how we view the world and our current responsibilities as global citizens. Our membership in the United Nations has played, and continues to play, a major part in our development. We not only support a fair, rules-based order in international affairs, but we exist, survive and\nprosper because of it. We see no viable alternative to that approach.\nIn peacekeeping, disarmament, sustainable development, climate-change issues, nutrition, human rights and humanitarian assistance, we  have  striven to match our words with actions, along with increased funding and support for multilateral  structures. While the system has its flaws and always requires improvement and modernization, Ireland is convinced that there is no other  way  to  meaningfully address the common opportunities and threats that  face  us all. For Ireland \u2014 and, I suggest, for many smaller Member States as well \u2014 multilateralism strengthens our independence, self-confidence and security, rather than diminishes it. If one believes, like Ireland, in multilateralism, now is the time to fight for it across the United Nations system, including, if necessary, standing in opposition to powerful countries  that  have traditionally played great  leadership  roles within this institution. We certainly cannot \u2014 and I will never \u2014 defend a logic that views multinational engagement as an abdication of national leadership or as a loss of influence on the international stage. We urgently need global leadership that galvanizes global support through strength of argument, as opposed to economic or military strength, and that leads to finding solutions to our collective problems so as to raise living standards for everybody, in particular for those furthest behind. We must start believing in a world where solidarity is just as, if not more, important as sovereignty \u2014 a world where we live in each other\u2019s shelter and not shadow.\nWe need \u2014 and I believe that we must demand during weeks like this one \u2014 positive outward- looking leadership by the great Powers of the United Nations, particularly Powers that traditionally have been indispensable, if imperfect, forces for good across the world. Without that, in truth, I fear for the future of global stability, and I fear for the future of the United Nations in the work that it must do \u2014 work that can never be replicated or replaced by transactional bilateral engagement where the powerful dominate decision-making, and decisions are no longer based on the strength of argument, compassion or generosity, but are instead based on States being forced to choose sides, fearful, perhaps, of being offside with the strong and powerful, or, in some cases, singled out for special treatment if they do not provide their support. Ireland does not wish to see any diminution in the role played\n \nby the United Nations leading actors and funders. At the same time, we will always demand a place on the stage for everyone and an atmosphere that encourages free speech and new, if sometimes controversial, thinking. The United Nations foundations will crumble without the inclusivity and generosity of thinking embedded through decades of experience. Sometimes it is the smallest States that have the answers to the biggest problems.\nToday we cannot be complacent about the institutional reforms needed to maximize the United Nations legitimacy and relevance in a rapidly changing world. Ireland salutes the efforts of the Secretary- General and welcomes the steps taken by the General Assembly on reform,  but  the implementation  of those reforms will be our real test of success. Ireland particularly wants to see the successful reform of the United Nations development system aimed at better supporting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why my Government earlier this month pledged more than $1 million in support of the reform of the United Nations development system as a complement to the strong financial support that Ireland has an obligation to continue to provide to United Nations funds, programmes and agencies.\nHowever, reforms at the United Nations must go beyond the managerial and structural level. The United Nations political bodies must also catch up to where the rest of the world is right now. That is particularly the case regarding the Security Council. Ireland is clear on the need to increase the size of the Council. Many areas of the world are either insufficiently represented in the Council or, in some cases, not represented at all. The historically unjust underrepresentation of Africa in particular needs to be addressed so that there can be an equitable African voice in Council decisions affecting their own continent, where much of the United Nations focus will be needed in the decades ahead. We know that. We also want to see the consideration of a designated role for small island developing States. The growing impact of climate change, which many speakers before me have mentioned, on international peace and security concerns adds weight to that call.\nIt is not only the composition of the Security Council, however, that needs to come under scrutiny. The use or threat of use of the veto remains a serious obstacle to the work of the Council, but also to that of the United Nations as a whole. Far too often the use of the veto has resulted in the shocking abandonment of\nsome of the most vulnerable people on our planet. The failure of the Security Council to take action to prevent mass-atrocity crimes betrays victims and undermines the United Nations credibility. History will not judge us kindly on that issue. I strongly believe that the political reform of the Council would inevitably lead to a greater sense of participation, responsibility and ownership among the United Nations membership, as a whole. That would surely only be positive for the functioning of the United Nations more broadly. Many say that people like me and others are wasting our time calling for the reform of the Security Council and that the great Powers will never allow it. That may be so, but if the power of evidence and argument is to mean anything in the Council Chamber, Ireland will keep trying to build a coalition for change.\nWhile recognizing the need for new structures, we also need to make the best use of existing structures and, of course, always look to improve them. International criminal justice, where there has been an irreversible and, I hope, significant shift towards accountability, is one such example. It is particularly pertinent to recall that fact on the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\nJustice and accountability always provide a better alternative to revenge, impunity or amnesty. We have seen important developments in the area of gender- based and sexual violence by enabling the prosecution of sexual violence as a war crime, a crime against humanity and genocide. I am glad to say  that  we  have witnessed universal justice strengthened beyond power politics and geopolitical interests. I am pleased to report that earlier this month, Ireland ratified the Amendments to the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court on the crime of aggression, which were agreed in Kampala. Yesterday I lodged our instrument of ratification with the Secretary-General.\nIreland welcomes the level of ambition at the heart of the Secretary-General\u2019s new disarmament agenda. We hope that it will serve as a turning point in the current challenges facing the disarmament and arms- control processes.\nIreland is proud of the historic role that it played in the development of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in the past century. The NPT demonstrates what States can achieve together in the spirit of peace and cooperation. However, we also have a responsibility to remain ambitious in the pursuit\n \nof the total elimination of nuclear weapons. I hope that our efforts to promote the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will continue to reflect that.\nIreland, like many in this Hall, is deeply concerned by the persistent use of explosive weapons in populated areas in armed conflicts around the globe. Civilian populations continue to bear the brunt of armed conflicts. We must redouble our efforts to fulfil the Secretary-General\u2019s call to address that challenge in   a more comprehensive way than we have to date. We continue to call on the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to abide by its obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions and its international commitments and to abandon all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic-missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. We welcome the progress towards that end.\nIreland\u2019s multilateralism runs deep through our commitment to United Nations peacekeeping. Our contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations enjoys a special place in the hearts of the Irish people. This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of Ireland\u2019s participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Tens of thousands of Irish women  and  men  have worn blue helmets or blue berets in United Nations peacekeeping operations over six decades, particularly on missions in Africa and the Middle East. Our Prime Minister stated here at United Nations Headquarters  in July that we are as proud of the blue helmet as we are of the harp or the shamrock \u2014 symbols of Ireland. Today there are more than 500 Irish defence force personnel \u2014 men and, increasingly, women, I am glad to say \u2014 deployed across the Middle East and Africa in six United Nations missions.\nThe humanitarian and development work of the United Nations is central to Ireland\u2019s commitment to the Organization. However, we  know  that  we  have an obligation to do more. We have reaffirmed our commitment to achieving the United  Nations  target of providing 0.7 per cent of  gross  national  income for official development assistance by 2030 \u2014 the same year that the world has pledged to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. But in real terms what that means is that Ireland would have to increase its  contribution  to  development  from approximately\n\u20ac750 million a year to more than \u20ac2.5 billion a year over the next 10 to 12 years. We are ambitious for Ireland\u2019s international  development  cooperation,  but  we  also\nneed to be authentic to our own experiences as we seek to maximize our contribution.\nMy country has known hunger and famine. We have known poverty. But we have also experienced transformation \u2014 a transformation based on education, innovation and a vibrant civic society. Of course, our values are not Ireland\u2019s alone. They are at the core of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the future that most people in this Hall seek. We know that, in order to create a peaceful, fair and just world, we must respect the human rights of everyone. Economic progress cannot be delivered at the cost of equality for all and of protecting the most vulnerable in our societies. We must also go beyond rhetoric in our efforts to empower women and girls. Gender equality cannot be seen as a gift to be granted but rather as a fundamental driver that can underpin real improvements in the lives of so many people.\nThe need for collective action to address climate change has been a common theme this week and is more evident by the month. As an island State, we learned centuries ago that the waters surrounding our island cannot deter forces beyond our control. Isolation certainly does not mean safety. Since I  spoke  here last year (see A/72/PV.20), Ireland  has  experienced its first hurricane, generated in the  eastern Atlantic, its most severe winter cold snap  and, this summer,  the most sustained drought in living memory. The denial of climate change needs to end, and collective action on climate adaptation, as well as mitigation, needs to intensify. Today many more island nations face challenges not of their own making as a result of climate change, pollution and rising sea levels. We must work together to overcome those challenges as nations united in our determination to protect ourselves and the way in which we live.\nMore broadly, the scale of the  humanitarian crises facing  the international  community  cannot  be overstated. More than 134 million people around the world are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, with conflict being the single greatest driver of that need. As a country committed to the humanitarian principles, we will continue to contribute to international efforts to ease the plight of civilians suffering the impact of conflicts in places such as South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Syria, Yemen, Palestine and, unfortunately, many other parts of the world.\n \nToday there are over 68 million people worldwide who have been forcibly displaced from their homes, with more than 25  million cross-border refugees. I  am very conscious that a huge majority of displaced people are being sheltered in countries that are already experiencing high levels of vulnerability and poverty and that their generosity places a huge strain on already very limited resources. Ireland will continue to support refugees and vulnerable host communities. However,  I want to particularly acknowledge the generosity of many States and the extraordinary burden that they bear today \u2014 States such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Pakistan, Turkey, Uganda and many more. Those countries host enormous numbers of people displaced by conflicts in neighbouring regions. We need to do more to help them.\nBangladesh is now host to the world\u2019s largest refugee camp, sheltering over 1 million refugees. In the year since I last addressed the General Assembly that camp has swelled  with  hundreds  of  thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing appalling violence in their neighbouring home state. The Rohingya must be assured of a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return, and the international community must insist on an end to impunity for the appalling acts of violence that have come to light, as well as ensure accountability for the crimes that have been committed.\nBecause of Ireland\u2019s experience of prolonged, intractable conflict, but one that ended in a successful peace settlement, the Israel-Palestine  conflict  and the lack of progress on a  peace agreement have  been a big foreign policy priority for me and for the Irish Government for many years. Ireland\u2019s own experience shows that even decades-long conflicts do have a turning point. Sometimes that turning point comes unexpectedly, and sometimes it happens quickly.\nPeace is a process; it is not a moment. To bear fruit, that process requires untiring work and commitment. We all surely realize by now that forced outcomes with winners and losers can never be a basis for lasting peace. From all my visits to the Middle East, I know that the current situation serves the interests of neither people, but I am also conscious that the burden of being under occupation is the heavier one.\nSettlement construction exacerbates that fact and is causing ever-greater damage to the prospects for peace. Ireland, like many, is very conscious of the threat to the small Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar and other\nstrategically located West Bank villages. Let me say this very clearly: what happens there will tell us much about whether we can count on a real commitment on the part of those involved to negotiating a two-State solution.\nThe situation in Gaza is also simply untenable, and the 1.9 million people living there desperately need the decade-long blockade to end so that they can start to rebuild normal lives and so that teenagers will reject the twisted promises of radicals and look to the future with some hope. They also need for the countries that fund terrorist activities, chaos and mismanagement in Gaza to halt their unwelcome interference without any further delay.\nWhen I visited Gaza I was struck by how much people there rely on the efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) \u2014 both to meet basic needs such as education and health care, but also to know that they are not forgotten. They are not forgotten by countries around the world. I am proud that Ireland is such a long- standing supporter of UNRWA, not  just in Gaza but  in the West Bank and across the region in Jordan and Lebanon too. Ireland will continue that assistance and has increased its contribution to \u20ac7 million for this year. I hope that before the end of the year we will have added even more to that, recognizing the financial pressures.\nI greatly regret the recent cuts to UNRWA funding announced by the United States, and I plead with those in power in that country to reconsider the consequences of their decisions in that regard. Reform of UNRWA may be needed, but surely it should happen in the context of a peace deal and a functioning Palestinian State in the future. Shutting off funding now is simply adding to the turmoil of current pressures and hardship, where UNRWA cuts are interpreted \u2014 certainly locally, on the ground \u2014 as collective punishment targeting women and children as well as men.\nIs it so hard to understand that increasing the misery of Palestinians only empowers the radicals, who want to poison the minds of hopeless, angry, young Palestinians and destabilize the moderate political leadership who are committed to a lasting peace? A people who have been downtrodden for decades will not be forced or pressurized into negotiating through enforced hardship or humiliation \u2014 the human soul simply does not work that way. How many examples of that do we need in order to learn that lesson? Without hope or dignity, minds close to the compromises that\n \nwe all know are necessary for a final settlement and for peace.\nI believe there is a way forward in the Middle East with American leadership, but also with the support and involvement of other countries that can help to broker a peace deal between an Israel that justifiably demands security in any future deal and a Palestinian people who dream of their own country and State. I know that Ireland is a small player in all of  that, but we will continue to advocate honestly for progress and justice as a friend of both Israel and Palestine.\nMember States know that Ireland is a proud and ambitious candidate for a seat on the Security Council at the elections that will be held in June 2020. We have been making our case better known with States over the past months. My apologies if we have been overdoing it. We Irish are by nature bridge-builders and talkers, but we listen too \u2014 to all sides \u2014 and work to build collective solutions to our global challenges. We are committed to hearing and heeding the voices of all States to forge consensus and common purpose. We think independently. Our path is very much our own, and we bring no partisan agenda to the table. We are here to serve the wider good and to support the United Nations. We will always fight for a multilateral system that works for all, particularly the small and the weak. We will be courageous when the United Nations and all of its Members need courage and leadership from the Security Council. Empathy, partnership  and independence will guide us.\nIreland is  a  small  country  with  a  broad  mind, a listening ear and a strong independent voice that promotes the values that I hope we all share and that can take this institution forward with confidence and fairness in the future.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me join other leaders in paying special tribute to the late Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations. The legacy left by that great son of Africa will forever remain carved in the history of the United Nations.\nI warmly congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, and I want to assure her of our full support in her work. I also thank Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his dedicated and able leadership, relentless commitment to multilateralism and continued engagement with Member States during his presidency.\nThe year 2018 is a  special year for  Mauritius, as it marks the fiftieth anniversary of our independence. We also celebrate, with immense pride and honour, 50 years of membership in this body. The theme for this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all\n \npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, is both apt and timely.\nWe are living in troubled times that are marked by uncertainty and complex threats to the peace, stability and sustainability of our planet. Increased international tensions, intractable conflicts, expanding pockets of poverty throughout the world, growing inequalities, the deterioration of the oceans, climate change, violent extremism and terrorism, nationalism, cyberthreats, escalating militarization and forced migration are only some of the perils that endanger global peace  and security. These challenges cannot be overcome without greater cooperation, global leadership and shared responsibilities.\nWe wholeheartedly welcome the reform process  to make the United  Nations  fit  for  purpose,  closer to and more consonant with the people it serves and better equipped to bring about the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so that no one, irrespective of race or gender, is left behind. My Government remains fully committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In that regard, Mauritius will present its  voluntary national review  at the 2019 high-level political forum on sustainable development next July.\nThe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway remains a valid road map for  us  to measure how much progress has been achieved in addressing the challenges and difficulties faced by small island developing States (SIDS), including climate change. We welcome the holding of the mid-term review of the SAMOA Pathway next September, and we call on all stakeholders to participate at the highest level, in order to assist SIDS in strengthening their resilience.\nThe stark effects of climate change are being felt all around the world. As we have seen in California, the Carolinas, the Philippines, China, Europe and elsewhere, the frequency of extreme weather events demonstrates that climate change can affect every country  on  every continent. Hurricanes, floods, droughts and wildfires are becoming deadlier, and weather patterns more severe. These disasters are sounding the alarm. Without a renewed global commitment to undertaking ambitious efforts aimed at combating climate change and adapting to its effects, we will fail to meet the\ntargets of the Paris Agreement and endanger our planet, as well as our own survival.\nWe cannot dissociate the climate from our oceans. Our planet\u2019s future also depends on our ability to further protect the oceans and increase their ability to act as a buffer against climate change. We need global leadership and enhanced multilateral cooperation to safeguard the ocean and its role as the natural weather regulator of our planet.\nAs a large ocean State that respects the rule of law and international law, Mauritius has taken the lead in the western Indian Ocean region in combating piracy and other transnational organized crimes and in keeping its territory and surrounding areas safe. As Chair of the Indian Ocean Commission, Mauritius co-hosted with the Commission a ministerial conference on maritime security in April to coordinate actions to fight transnational organized crimes, such as drug trafficking, piracy and human trafficking. In doing so, we have consolidated our engagement with the United Nations system, in particular, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Department of Political Affairs, with which we recently signed a memorandum of understanding to assist the Indian Ocean region in fighting these security threats and challenges.\nWe are equally concerned about the situation in the Middle East, where the scourge of violence and war continues to claim innocent lives. Peace in that region will remain elusive as long as the international community does not live up to its legal and moral responsibilities to uphold international law. Mauritius therefore reiterates its call for renewed and genuine international efforts in favour of negotiations towards the speedy realization of a  two-State solution,  with an independent and viable Palestine existing side by side and at peace with the State of Israel. While we wait for this to happen, it is extremely important that the suffering of the people, especially women and children, is alleviated through renewed and increased international support.\nDespite all the current efforts, terrorism remains  a painful reality, claiming numerous lives daily and threatening world peace and development. It is urgent that we build consensus on global counter-terrorism efforts and reinforce multilateral cooperation in fighting this scourge. Indeed, we must pay  attention to why individuals are attracted to violent extremist groups. We believe firmly that the creation of open,\n \nequitable, inclusive and pluralist societies, based on the full respect of human rights and with education and economic opportunities for all, represents the most effective way to ending violent extremism.\nIn that same vein, we need to reinforce global non-proliferation regimes. The continued existence of nuclear arsenals and the threat of a nuclear disaster represents a major impediment to the maintenance of peace and security. We must also remain vigilant with regard to the cyberthreats that endanger our national security. As highlighted in the new disarmament agenda that the Secretary-General presented in May, we must create secure physical and cyberzones in space, on land and on the seas, and we need to do whatever is necessary to make our planet a safe place for all.\nDrug trafficking and unregulated drug consumption have the potential to destroy the future of our young people. We are all too well aware of how drugs undermine sustainable human  development  and the stability  of  countries  and  whole  regions.  My Government remains determined to fight drug trafficking. In that regard, our commission of inquiry on drug trafficking, set up to inquire on all aspects of drug trafficking in Mauritius, has recently submitted its findings. I have set up a ministerial committee to look into its recommendations, which include strengthening the existing institutional framework and reviewing the relevant legislation. To address the evolving challenges of drugs, my country has committed to the Global Call to Action on the World Drug Problem. More than ever, we need closer cooperation to address this scourge.\nWe must be careful not to undermine the multilateral system, as it has served the community of nations well. The United Nations was created to bring States together. It also established conditions under which justice and respect for the law can be maintained and strengthened.\nConscious of the responsibility of belonging to the Assembly, my country made a pledge at its admission in 1968 to uphold the great ideals that are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We gave the assurance that we would bring our contribution, however modest it might be, to shaping the destiny of a better world.\nAs a responsible member of this community of nations, Mauritius has remained true to that pledge. Today I reaffirm my country\u2019s continued commitment to the ideals and values of the Organization, its respect for international law and faith in international partnership\nso as to build a safer and more prosperous world. It is with this commitment that Mauritius subscribes to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and we look forward  to  its  adoption  in  Marrakech in December.\nIn the same spirit of upholding the Charter of the United Nations, and based on their commitment to the international rule of law, in June 2017 member States of the Group of African States introduced draft resolution A/71/L.73, requesting an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965.  At  the  heart of  this request for  an advisory opinion is the issue of decolonization, a matter of international public order under the Charter and a central element of the work of the United Nations and General Assembly. To date, the decolonization of Mauritius remains incomplete, thanks to the unlawful excision of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius prior to its accession to independence.\nThe hearings at the Court have been completed, and the judges will now deliberate on a matter that has raised important issues relating to decolonization and human rights, particularly the right to self-determination of the people of Mauritius and the plight of Mauritians of Chagossian origin who were forcibly removed from the Chagos Archipelago. The advisory opinion will also further clarify and strengthen the rule of law at the international level at a time when such strengthening is greatly needed. I  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to express my Government\u2019s appreciation to all the member States of the African Union that have actively participated in the written and oral proceedings of the International Court of Justice relating to this matter.\nThe United Nations is and will always be at the centre of all action for sustainable development, peace and security. While we applaud the three-pronged reform of the United Nations led by the Secretary- General,  considerable  resources  will   be   required to match this ambition. We therefore appeal to all stakeholders to be generous in supporting the reform by providing adequate resources on a predictable basis. We also appeal for a special consideration of Africa\u2019s needs and priorities in the restructuring of the peace and security architecture.\nWe commend the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at enhancing the framework of cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union,\n \nwhich is so vital to sustained peace and development on the continent. Africa\u2019s growth is showing promising signs of rebounding, and several countries are already undergoing positive transitions. Elections in Africa during the last several years demonstrate that African countries have strengthened their democracies, while ensuring a peaceful transition of power. We welcomed the signing of a historical peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea ending two decades of tension that followed years of open conflict, causing the loss of thousands of lives. The improved political climate, reconciliation efforts and inclusive participation rights herald a new age of governance that deserves to be supported by the international community.\nOne aspect of United Nations reform where we find progress wanting is in the collective aspiration for a strengthened and more legitimate Security Council that reflects today\u2019s reality. We once again call for reform of the Security Council and repeat our plea for the start of a text-based negotiation. We all agree that an equitable representation of Africa on the Security Council will not only redress a gross historical injustice but also render the Council more democratic and representative. We also support India\u2019s legitimate aspiration for a permanent seat in an enlarged Security Council and a non-permanent seat for small island developing States.\nFour days ago we celebrated the memory and legacy of one of Africa\u2019s most illustrious leaders, Nelson Mandela (see A/73/PV.4 et seq.). As world leaders, we would benefit from being inspired by the words and actions of Mandela, especially when he said:\n\u201cWhat counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.\u201d\nTogether we can make that difference.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate the President on her election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. I would also like to extend my sincere greetings to everyone here, as well as to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k and his team on their excellent work during the previous session.\nI would like to  express  my  country\u2019s  gratitude to Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his commitment to serving the United Nations, and to reaffirm the Niger\u2019s support for the continuation of the reforms he has courageously undertaken to adapt our shared Organization to the demands  and  challenges of modern times. The challenges, as we all know, are certainly enormous. But thanks to his determination and his excellent team, we believe that we will be able to achieve the expected results. In that regard, I would like to assure him of my delegation\u2019s full support.\nBy giving this session the theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, we have been both provided with a timely reminder of the profound motives that led to the\n \ncreation of the United Nations and called on to renew our confidence in it. My delegation can therefore only welcome that appropriate choice of theme in a world facing multiple challenges, such as terrorism, violent extremism, climate change, migration  and  poverty, all of which require greater international cooperation and responsible engagement on the part of all of us. In that regard, the Niger believes that the United Nations remains a valuable and irreplaceable organization, not only for promoting international peace and security but also for responding effectively to the various challenges facing our States. In other words, my country prioritizes multilateralism and the unifying role of the United Nations. Our combined efforts and resources for reaching common solutions remain the best alternative in our efforts to ensure peace, security and the harmonious development for humankind.\nConcerning the issue of migration, the Niger welcomes the finalization of the draft text of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, the first-ever international agreement initiated by the United Nations on managing migration. Combating irregular migration and other shameful  practices such as the illegal smuggling of migrants and human trafficking has been the focus of many international meetings in recent years. During those meetings, many commitments were made to eradicating those scourges. In 2016, in order to implement those commitments, the Niger outlined and implemented an operational doctrine based on balanced legislation and commensurate regulatory measures, which have enabled us to deliver concrete results. For example, between October 2016 and January of this year we reduced by 90 per cent the monthly total of potential migrants entering the city of Agadez, the main point of entry and exit for migrants in the Niger. In 2017, 268 traffickers were referred to the courts, and 140 of their vehicles were impounded. Those results, which have been unanimously acknowledged and commended by the international community, are the product of the commitment and political will of President Mahamadou Issoufou to combating irregular migration and trafficking in persons and helping to eradicate the inhuman and degrading treatment of migrants beyond Agadez.\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome the cooperation between the Niger and the United Nations through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration, which contribute\nsignificantly to managing migration flows in my country. The Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, to be held in Marrakech in December, will result in the adoption of the global compact and will certainly be a defining moment. The Niger, as a perfect example of a transit country, will attend the Conference in Marrakech in order to support the initiative as a starting point for structured international cooperation on migration.\nThe  Sustainable  Development  Goals   remain one of the major preoccupations of the international community in general, and  of  developing  countries in particular. Three years after their adoption, my country has just presented its first voluntary national review of its implementation of the Goals at the High- level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held here in New York in July. The Forum, under the theme \u201cTransformation towards sustainable and resilient societies\u201d, provided the  Niger  with  an  opportunity to share with other members of the international community our progress, especially in the areas of energy access, education and health services, as well as security. In pursuing development, my country has adopted a 2035 strategy for sustainable development and inclusive growth, incorporated into  its 2017- 2021 economic and social development plan, which constitutes the national framework for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The strategy is also linked to the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 for the development of the continent, one of the key implementation instruments of which is the African Free Continental Trade Area, adopted in Rwanda in March at the tenth extraordinary summit of the African Union, convened for that purpose.\nThe Free Trade Area is aimed specifically at overcoming dependence on commodity  exports  and at promoting social and economic transformation so  as to achieve inclusive growth, industrialization and sustainable development throughout the continent. Considerable efforts to mobilize domestic resources are being pursued diligently in line with the spirit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. It is nonetheless clear that many challenges remain and must be overcome if we are to meet the goals of those various programmes. Hence the need for the effective implementation of a more proactive and equitable global partnership in accordance with the commitments\n \nmade by developed countries with regard to official development assistance.\nIn addition, as a country of the Sahel with two thirds of its land area in the desert, the Niger is being hit hard by the effects of climate change, whose economic consequences are on the verge of making people\u2019s lives intolerable. The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change represents a unique opportunity to save our planet. The Niger has taken pride  in  implementing the measures set out in the Agreement\u2019s road map. Accordingly, in November, at President Mahamadou Issoufou\u2019s initiative as Chair of the Sahel climate commission, my country will host a round table for technical and financial partners to identify guidelines for the implementation of the Sahel region climate investment plan. I therefore call on the international community, as well as our various partners, to participate in that endeavour. Financing the plan will enable the Sahel countries to manage the impact of climate change on populations and ecosystems more effectively.\nThe demographic challenge is another priority area for my country, which is dealing with a population growth rate of 4.2 per cent, the highest in the world, according to our 2012 general census of the population. Aware of the impasse that the country could face if nothing is done to reduce that rate, the Government has redoubled its efforts by engaging the people and their traditional and religious leaders and partners in  a significant effort to reverse the trend. Since then we have noted a drop in the overall national average birth rate from 7.6 children per woman in 2012 to 6 per woman in 2017. If that trend continues, within several years we hope to achieve manageable population growth in relation to our gross national product. For that we need the robust support of the international community. At the same time, the Government will pursue efforts to enrol girls in school and ensure that they stay in school up to the compulsory age of 16, as the two problems are closely linked.\nI mentioned earlier the major challenges  facing the Sahel region in general and the Niger in particular. They involve terrorism, cross-border crime, extreme poverty and climate and  environmental  shocks,  all of which have disrupted our agro-pastoral economy and increased the vulnerability of the peoples of the Sahel. In order to tackle our security challenges, the Heads of State and Government of the region have taken initiatives, including by pooling their resources\nthrough the establishment of the Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad basin countries and of  the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), in order to mitigate the Malian crisis and its spillover into neighbouring countries.\nWith regard to the situation in the Lake Chad basin region, the 2014 deployment of the Multinational Joint Force made up of troops from Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria and the Niger has enabled us to weaken the operational capacity of the terrorist group Boko Haram, thereby contributing to the gradual return of peace and stability to the subregion. The challenge facing the region today is therefore becoming markedly more socioeconomic rather  than  security-related.  It is now  a  matter of  gradually ensuring the welfare of a population reeling from the disasters created by the years of violent conflict that have resulted in hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons. It is also a matter of rebuilding the region\u2019s economy, while prioritizing youth employment and rebuilding the Lake Chad region. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all partners currently involved in dealing with the humanitarian consequences of that conflict.\nWithin the framework of the  G-5  Sahel,  the Joint Force for that region was established in 2017 to combat terrorism and cross-border crime within the five member countries more effectively, as well as to secure the region and thereby create the conditions necessary for implementing development programmes. The process of making the Joint Force operational has not been as rapid as the countries concerned would have liked. However, with the impetus provided by the African Heads of State and Government at the thirty- first African Union Summit in Nouakchott in July,  the process seems to be gaining momentum. The four operations undertaken with the support of Operation Barkhane, led by France, have been successful. The Joint Force\u2019s primary concern involves obtaining, in a sustainable way, the resources needed to carry out its work. The international high-level conference on the Sahel held  in Brussels in February made it  possible to secure the financing required for the first year. We welcome that accomplishment, thank those partners that pledged to support our efforts financially, and urgently appeal for the completion of the process needed to make the pledged funds available. Beyond the first year\u2019s scope of work, however, the outlook is not reassuring with regard to ensuring that the Joint Force has the necessary funding to complete its mission. In\n \norder to ensure sustained funding and resources for it, we continue to believe that the best-advised solution would be to give it a mandate under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. It is a matter of peace and security in the region, and even the world.  We find it difficult to understand the hesitation shown by certain countries when faced with the obvious.\nThe challenges facing us are not only security- related. They are above all economic. The  Sahel needs meaningful investments for its  development. We welcome the ubiquitous initiatives to that end, including those of the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and other bilateral partners, but we must act fast in coordinating their implementation. The upcoming meeting in Nouakchott on 6 December dedicated to the G-5 Sahel priority investment programme will be a major test for efforts to deal resolutely with the issue of development, which, in my opinion, is the best defence against terrorism.\nConcerning other conflicts in Africa, my country welcomes the de-escalation in the Horn of Africa over the past three months and the peace agreement signed by the warring parties in South Sudan. Those are two pieces of good news, and we can only be grateful for the wisdom that led to them. With regard to the Middle East, our meeting here is taking place in an environment in which international solidarity with the Palestinian cause is undergoing a noticeable decline in terms of political and financial support, resulting in  budget cuts and the recognition of Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the capital of Israel by certain members of the international community. The Niger reaffirms its support for the aspirations of the Palestinian people to realize their right to establish their own independent and sovereign State within the June 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. With regard to Yemen, we express our commitment to that country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Niger rejects all forms of interference in its internal affairs and supports it  in  its search for a peaceful solution to the current bloody conflict and efforts to achieve comprehensive and harmonious development.\nSince the 2005 World Summit, we at the United Nations have been working on comprehensive reform of the United Nations system, aimed at enabling the Organization to play its unifying and leading role in realizing solidarity and friendship among peoples. In our view, the new global partnership for development must mean a decrease in intra- and inter-State\ninequalities and the collaboration of every State \u2014 large or small, rich or poor \u2014 in the decision-making process in overseeing world affairs. That is how we will ensure balanced governance at the United Nations. With regard to reform of the Security Council, the Niger remains committed to the African Common Position eshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus. We strongly encourage Member States to step up that process and demonstrate greater resolve in their efforts to adapt the Security Council to the realities of today\u2019s world.\nIn conclusion, on behalf of peacekeeping operations, I stress the fact that new forms of conflict, particularly asymmetrical wars, impose demands on us to which we would like to see a response in the form of a radical transformation of the current United Nations peacekeeping system. That will require strengthening cooperation among the United Nations, regional organizations and the troop-contributing countries and providing missions with conflict-specific mandates.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to convey the most cordial greetings of the Malian people, from Kayes to Kidal and from Sikasso to Taoudenni, passing through Konna in the Mopti region. I would like to extend my warm congratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. That is a choice that honours her and, beyond that, her beautiful country of Ecuador, with which Mali has excellent relations in terms of cooperation. I wish to say to the President that, with the help of the United Nations and of the international community, Mali has today reached a significant milestone in its destiny following the successful presidential elections we recently held.\n \nAs is customary, I should also like to congratulate the President\u2019s predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k of Slovakia, for the outstanding results he achieved during the seventy-second session. Let me also express my deepest gratitude to the Secretary-General of our common Organization, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his leadership and many initiatives aimed at further strengthening the effectiveness and credibility of the United Nations.\nBefore continuing, I wish to pay shining tribute to the memory of the late Kofi Annan, former Secretary- General, who was taken from us on 18 August. I remember him as a great African diplomat who worked throughout his life to promote international peace, security and development across the world.\nMali welcomes the President\u2019s decision to place the current session under the theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful,  equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. This theme is certainly of paramount importance for all States Members of our Organization. Its aims and principles remain relevant, including in the areas of preventing and managing the many crises that we, the peoples of the United Nations, face.\nFor its part, Mali commends the immense and multifaceted contribution of the  United  Nations  to its ongoing stabilization process. I would like to pay tribute to the women and men of United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali for their commitment and sacrifice in a complex and difficult security context.\nAs leaders we have a collective responsibility to do more and better in order to render our Organization even more relevant and effective for all. To do so, the United Nations requires reforms that will lead to a peaceful, inclusive, equitable and sustainable international community. In that regard, Mali welcomes the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General in the spheres of development, peace and security.\nHowever, we need to reinforce those initiatives by agreeing to also reform some of the principal organs, including the Security Council and the General Assembly, including when it comes to their respective compositions and working methods. It is also at the cost of those essential reforms that we will collectively be able to fulfil the deepest aspirations of our peoples and\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe year 2018 is devoted to pursuing and strengthening the democratic and republican steps taken by Mali and its people towards peace, stability and development to the benefit of all populations of the Sahel region, and indeed beyond. Despite the numerous challenges that my country is facing, the presidential elections were able to take place within the constitutional timelines on 29 July and 12 August, in conditions welcomed by the entire international community. The inclusive nature of the organization of the elections, attested to by the participation of all political and civil society stakeholders, allowed citizens to freely express their choice and to prove the political, democratic and republican maturity of the Malian people.\nFor my part, upon the conclusion of the elections,  I took full measure of the confidence that the Malian nation had just renewed in me. That is why I am committed to restoring trust between the State and its citizens to further improve the country\u2019s governance. Moreover, I will work relentlessly for the diligent and inclusive implementation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, outcome of the Algiers process, which, I will not cease to repeat, is the only alternative for my country to reconnect with peace and stability, a prerequisite for all development. To achieve those goals in the context of my country, a sacred union of all forces of the nation is required. Likewise, I reiterate my unwavering commitment to give pride of place to dialogue and consultation in the management of public affairs.\nI remain determined to advance the peace process in Mali to ensure that my country emerges from the worst crisis in its history. Therefore, under my authority, the Government and other Malian actors, with the support of our partners, have  achieved  significant  progress in the implementation of the Agreement  for  Peace and Reconciliation. Among these major achievements, I wish to underscore that there have been no clashes or confrontations between the Malian armed forces and armed movements since the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali was signed in May 2015. I also happily recall the restoration of Malian authority to Kidal and other areas of the country. The presence of the State in these regions, which were hit hard by the crisis, has made it possible, among other things, to open classes for the benefit of children and contributed to\n \nthe gradual provision of the necessary basic services so that the people can enjoy the dividends of peace.\nMoreover, I note with satisfaction the establishment and ongoing operationalization of territorial communities in the M\u00e9naka and Taoudenni regions, the establishment of interim authorities in the five northern regions, the launch  of  the  operations  of  the Operational Coordination Mechanism in Kidal, Timbuktu and Gao, and progress in the processes of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security-sector reform.\nI am fully aware that these gains are fragile. I am also aware that we  need to do  more and better. This  is the purpose of the road map of 22 March. I have instructed the Government to honour its commitments pursuant to these mechanisms. However, I must stress that political will alone will not be enough to  fulfil  all the commitments undertaken in the Agreement. Adequate technical and financial support will also be required. I take this opportunity to reiterate my call for the effective and rapid mobilization of the resources pledged by our partners with a view to helping us achieve all commitments contained in the road map by the agreed deadlines.\nI can also assure the Assembly that the people of Mali are most grateful for the active solidarity of the international community in the form of the presence and support of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, the European forces, the French Operation  Barkhane,  the  Group  of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States and neighbouring countries.\nIn addition to the devastating effects of climate change on the living conditions of our population, the Sahel has for several years faced terrorism, transnational organized crime and trafficking of all kinds, especially of drugs, arms, illicit goods and migrants, and money- laundering. A war for the anti-Christ, from before the Prophet; a war waged on behalf of darkness, in which death is not an accident, a battlefield casualty or even or a supreme sacrifice but the ultimate goal \u2014 that is what we are dealing with in the Sahel. It is all too easy to understand the urgency of the universal call to fight against terrorism.\nWe established the G-5 Sahel, comprising Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and the Niger, in Nouakchott in November 2014, to pool our efforts to\naddress our region\u2019s security and development issues, having fully grasped the link between  the  fragility  of States and the precariousness our populations at times experience, and how certain interests may seek to use it to subversive ends. However, the G-5 Sahel Joint Force is struggling to become fully operational as it lacks the appropriate mandate and, in particular, sufficient funding.\nWe believe that the fight against terrorism in the Sahel is an important contribution to global security. That is why we continue to ask the Security Council  to authorize the deployment of the Force under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United  Nations, with adequate, sustainable and predictable funding, including through the United Nations, so as to enable it to carry out his mandate consistently and effectively. In the same vein, we invite our bilateral and multilateral partners, who made pledges of financial contributions in February at the Brussels Conference, to honour those commitments to the G-5 Sahel Joint Force. In parallel with the security response, the G-5 Sahel is working  to implement its Priority Investment Programme to address development challenges, which are among the root causes of instability in our shared region.\nAt the national level, I have made the fight against poverty one of the priorities of my second five-year term. During my swearing-in, on 4 September, I pledged before the Malian people to do all in my power to optimize our system of national solidarity so as to forge a Mali where no one is left behind. I want to launch a new social model based on equality and social justice and that will create the conditions for everyone to succeed. Promoting Malian youth will be at the centre of my work over the next five years. I have made young people the great cause of my second term. I will commit to a national youth pact through significant investments in renewing our education and training system, and to promote employment.\nIn the same vein, I will not only continue but step up the implementation of major road infrastructure, agriculture, water, energy and social housing projects. I remain convinced that implementing these priority actions will accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the national level. In that regard, Mali is pleased to have presented in July, here in New York, its voluntary national report on SDG implementation.\n \nAs a country of origin and transit as well as a destination for migrants, Mali welcomes the conclusion of negotiations on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration \u2014 and, I would add, humane migration. This collective decision gives hope to the 250 million migrants throughout the world and, beyond them, to all of humankind at a time when migration has become a major issue  for  all  States. Mali  will,  of course, play an active role at the international conference to be held in Marrakech in December with a view to the formal adoption of the global compact  for safe, orderly and regular migration, which now offers us a comprehensive framework for managing migration governance globally. At the same time, Mali will continue to shoulder its share of  responsibility   in managing migratory flows, in accordance with its national migration policy.\nDespite our domestic situation, the people and Government of Mali remain attuned to the situation  in Africa and the rest of the world. In Africa, we welcome the normalization of diplomatic relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as the conclusion of a peace agreement between our brothers in South Sudan. We also thoroughly commend the successful holding of legislative elections in our fellow Republic of Mauritania, and praise the people of that brotherly and friendly nation for its political maturity and commitment to democracy.\nHowever, we are deeply concerned at the situation in Libya, which regrettably continues to negatively impact the security and stability of the Sahel region. In the light of this situation, which has lasted for too long, we call urgently on the international community to persuade the Libyan parties to prioritize dialogue and seek a lasting solution to the crisis.\nWe are also following with concern the situation in the Middle East, especially in the occupied territories. The people of Mali reaffirm their support to the brotherly people of Palestine in their legitimate struggle for self-determination. The Government of Mali calls for the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations aimed at reaching a two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and within secure and internationally recognized borders.\nIn humanitarian terms, Mali is concerned about the precarious situation of the 65 million refugees and internally displaced persons worldwide as a result of armed conflicts, natural disasters and climate change.\nI am thinking in particular of my  compatriots  who are refugees in neighbouring countries, which I thank for their hospitality and generosity. I assure those compatriots that the Government will spare no effort in continuing to assist them and to create the conditions for them to return home in safety and dignity.\nMali has never faltered in its belief in international solidarity and cherishes its cooperation with the United Nations, which today provides us with a range of support. Mali, which I have the privilege of leading today, reaffirms its commitment to playing its full part in building a peaceful, equitable and prosperous world for all.\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm the profound gratitude of the people and theGovernment of Mali to the United Nations and our bilateral and multilateral partners for their unwavering support to the peace process in Mali. For my part, I reaffirm my full commitment to sparing no effort to ensure that the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, emanating from the Algiers process, is implemented diligently and fully.\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin by congratulating Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly. The stewardship of this session by an accomplished leader of her rank and stature will undoubtedly lend to the proceedings of the Assembly greater credence and strength. I also commend Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his able guidance during the previous session.\nWe appreciate Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his exemplary leadership of the Organization, and support his efforts to instil a new sense of  mission and direction within the United  Nations.  We  offer our profound condolences over the passing of the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was a leading light and a driving force in taking the United Nations agenda forward into the twenty-first century.\nWe also express our deep sympathy and condolences to the Government and people of Indonesia over the damage caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.\nTwo months ago, the people  of  Pakistan  voted for change, reform and a fundamental shift in their paradigm of governance. They opted for a Pakistan that is confident and compassionate, open and articulate, as well as peaceful and principled \u2014 a Pakistan that will engage with its neighbourhood and the world on the basis of equality and respect; a country that will\n \nseek the resolution of conflicts and the convergence of interests; and a State that will build upon common understandings,  reciprocal  commitments  and  shared ideals.\nPakistan will brook no compromise on the interests of the nation, the sovereignty of the State or the security of its people. Our Government is keen to pursue a policy of partnerships for peace, security and prosperity in our immediate neighbourhood and beyond. We  seek   a peaceful environment to promote our development agenda, at both the national and the regional levels.\nI stand before the Assembly as the representative of a quintessential developing country that has the welfare of its people at its heart. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, we have begun giving shape to the vision of a new Pakistan through a set of integrated policies and programmes.\nThe world is  facing  a  moment  of  inflection. The very foundations and principles on which the edifice of global order has been constructed are  under assault. Inequality within and among  nations  is on the rise. The forces of protectionism, populism and isolationism are gaining currency. Intolerance is ascendant over acceptance, rhetoric over reason, and power over principle. Where the world needs bridges, we see fortifications; where it needs highways, we see blockades; and where it yearns for freedom, we see cages. New forms and manifestations of imperialism are appearing. Multilateralism is on a path of retreat. Unilateralist tendencies are growing. Long-standing legal norms are being eroded for strategic and commercial considerations.\nDark clouds of  trade  wars  are  looming  large  on the horizon. The challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, pandemics, transnational organized crime and sustainable development are becoming ever more complex. The post-World War idealism is giving way, slowly but surely, to a hardened, militaristic approach. That trend is not only regressive, it is downright dangerous.\nWe note with concern seismic shifts in the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. As existing conflicts are exacerbated, new threats have emerged. Competing interests of regional and extraregional Powers are deepening long-standing fissures and widening the fault lines, even as the tragedy of Palestine continues to fester. In these uncertain times, the global\ncommunity appears to be on a desperate quest for\nleadership, a vision and an order.\nLet us consider the issue of striking the right balance between the freedom of expression and the sentiments of a people. Where there ought to be empathy, understanding and compassion, we see caricatured, ill- informed and jaundiced judgments. Recently, Muslims across the world were pained at a planned competition of cartoons of our holy Prophet \u2014 peace be upon him. That deeply hurt Muslim sentiments and sensibilities. For its part, Pakistan will continue  to  collaborate with friends and partners on the United Nations and Organization of Islamic Cooperation platforms aimed at reversing the growing tide of bigotry, at building cross-cultural understandings and promoting dialogue among civilizations.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s General  Assembly session is not only apt  but  also mirrors the priorities of my Government. As we embark on our journey of change and reform, Pakistan stands ready to strengthen its partnership with the United Nations family of institutions. Alongside like-minded States, we will continue to be a leading voice advocating for the comprehensive reform of  the  Security Council, with a view to making it more democratic, representative, transparent and effective. We will continue to oppose the creation of new centres of  privilege and prestige  in defiance of the principles of democracy and the core tenet of the Charter of the United Nations on the sovereign equality of Member States.\nSince its inception, Pakistan has been an ardent adherent to the Charter of the United Nations, and an active participant in United Nations processes. Pakistan has served seven terms on the Security Council, five presidencies of the Economic and Social Council and four terms on the Human Rights Council. That is a reaffirmation of the international community\u2019s  faith in Pakistan.\nWe have championed the cause of the peoples of Africa and Asia as they seek to exercise their inalienable right of self-determination and wrest independence from the yoke of colonial rule. As we pay tribute to the memory of the late Nelson Mandela, Madiba, we are reminded of the high ideals for which he sacrificed so much. The best way to honour the legacy of that great leader is to continue to fight the good fight for freedom, dignity and equality.\n \nPakistan remains one of the oldest, largest and most active contributors to United Nations peacekeeping operations the world over. Pakistani Blue Helmets have laid down their lives in the cause of global peace. We are proud of their sacrifices. Pakistan also remains host to one of the oldest peacekeeping missions, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan. We greatly value the Observer Group\u2019s contribution to monitoring the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.\nPakistan desires a relationship with India based  on sovereign equality and mutual respect. We seek resolution of disputes through serious and comprehensive dialogue that covers all issues of concern. We were to meet on the sidelines of this session of the General Assembly to talk about all issues with India. The Modi Government of India called off the dialogue for the third time, each time on flimsy grounds. They chose politics over peace. They used the pretext of Pakistani stamps issued months ago depicting a Kashmiri activist and grave human rights violations, including pellet gun victims, as an excuse to back out from the talks.\nDialogue is the only way to address the long- standing issues that have long bedevilled South Asia and prevented the region from realizing its true potential. The unresolved Jammu and Kashmir dispute hinders the realization of the goal of durable peace between our two countries. For over 70 years now, it has remained on the agenda of the Security Council and is a blot on the conscience of humankind. For 70 years, the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir have struggled for their right to self-determination in the face of overwhelming oppression and gross violations of their fundamental human rights by the Indian occupation forces.\nPakistan welcomes the recently released report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The report rightly lifts the veil from decades of obfuscation and chronicles the massive ongoing violations of human rights in Indian-occupied Kashmir. It vindicates our position. No longer can the excuse of terrorism be used to continue to systematically oppress the Kashmiri people. Pakistan endorses the United Nations report and calls for the early institution of a commission of inquiry under United Nations auspices to investigate and ascribe responsibility. We will welcome the commission to Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and we hope that India will do the same, too.\nTo divert the world\u2019s attention from its brutalities, India frequently violates the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Kashmir. Despite numerous violations, Pakistan has acted with restraint. But if India ventures across the Line of Control, or acts upon its doctrine of limited war against Pakistan, it will evoke a strong and matching response.\nStrategic stability in our region has been and continues to be undermined. That is evident in various ways, including by the introduction of destabilizing weapon systems, the pursuit of discriminatory approaches by certain States to supply advanced military hardware and sensitive technologies, and the adoption of offensive force postures and  doctrines that envisage a conflict beneath the nuclear threshold. In the circumstances, Pakistan has no option but to maintain a minimum credible deterrence. We have been advocating for many years now for a strategic restraint regime for South Asia. Pakistan is ready to engage with India to promote meaningful confidence-building, risk reduction and measures to avoid an arms race.\nLet me also reiterate Pakistan\u2019s continued support for strengthening regional organizations as platforms for poverty alleviation and socioeconomic  uplift.  The regional body for South Asia, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), has been rendered ineffective owing to the intransigence of one country. We remain fully committed to a functioning SAARC that can improve the lives of the people of the region.\nAfghanistan, and together with it, Pakistan, has suffered heavily owing to global power plays, strategic miscalculations and cognitive dissonance. That there is no military solution to the war in Afghanistan is now a foregone conclusion. It is time to act upon that conclusion. A negotiated settlement has assumed urgency in the face of the worrisome and growing presence of Da\u2019esh in Afghanistan. Pakistan will continue to lend its support to an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace and reconciliation process.\nOn the bilateral plane, our two countries have operationalized the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity. It lays down the blueprint for extensive engagement in all areas of common interests. Pakistan has hosted the longest-lasting refugee presence of modern times. Our role and sacrifices can perhaps be better appreciated when juxtaposed with the rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiments in nations that are\n \nmore resource-rich and developed than ours and that have faced the brunt of fewer immigrants and over a shorter timescale. Because of the protracted conflict situation in that country, Afghanistan\u2019s security has a direct spillover impact on our security and stability. We look forward to the safe, dignified and voluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland.\nFor the past 17 years, Pakistan, at a great cost of life and resources, has been combating the fires of terrorism and extremism. Through the determined operations of our armed forces and with the full support of our people, Pakistan has turned the tide against terrorism. With the deployment of 200,000 troops, Pakistan has conducted the largest and most effective counter-terrorism campaign in the world. Peace and security have returned to our cities and towns. In our own national interest and in line with our national action plan, we will continue to strengthen our counter- terrorism frameworks and regimes.\nPakistan continues to face terrorism that is financed, facilitated and orchestrated by our eastern neighbour. We wanted to sit with India to discuss all issues, including terrorism, that have created violence in our cities and towns and have led to tens of thousands of casualties among innocent Pakistanis. Pakistan shall never forget the mass murder of more than 150 children in a Peshawar school, the terrible Mastung attack and many others that have links with terrorists supported by India, and we will never forget the terrorist attack in India against the Samjhauta Express, which was carrying innocent Pakistanis \u2014 and now its confessed perpetrators are being allowed to walk free.\nWe wanted to share the evidence with India and the international community concerning those who supported those acts of violence and terrorism. We have already shared that evidence with the United Nations. We have in our custody a serving Indian naval officer, Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav, who  has  provided us with the most incriminating evidence by accepting that he, at the instruction of his Government, financed, planned and executed acts of terrorism and violence in Pakistan. That is but one Indian State-sponsored official terrorist. Many more have been launched by our eastern neighbour inside Pakistan to create terror and mayhem.\nIt is India that, in plain sight of the international community, perpetrates State-sponsored terrorism in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and in other parts\nof India. It is of concern to the United Nations, given the fact that Jammu and Kashmir remains on the agenda of the Security Council, and it is a matter of concern for the international community, as humankind is being crushed and human rights are being violated all over India, where people have stood up against oppression and occupation and demanded their fundamental rights. It is also a matter of concern for the international community that India has sponsored terrorism and aggression against all of its neighbours.\nThe strongest antidote to the poison of terrorism  is development that yields dividends. The vision of the Belt and Road Initiative is path-breaking and is being led by a world leader of great wisdom and foresight to create a community of common destiny. It is a global common good that is beneficial to all. Our vision for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is to help translate our geostrategic potential into geoeconomic dividends. Pakistan looks to offer the vital connectivity nodes linking the Middle East with western China, which will afford Central Asia the shortest, most feasible access possible to the sea.\nThe challenges of our times have enhanced, not diminished, the relevance of the United Nations. The United Nations must  remain  the  central  platform  for dialogue and diplomacy. In order for the United Nations to remain relevant to the needs of the people and respond to the demands of the twenty-first century, we believe that the following steps must by taken.\nFirst, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be pursued in order to reduce inequality within and among nations. We hope that the Secretary- General\u2019s High-level Conference on Financing for Development and the Means of Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, held earlier this week, will serve as a catalyst for rapid progress towards achieving the SDGs.\nSecond, corruption is a grave crime. Those who provide safe havens for ill-gotten wealth are partners in the crime and equally culpable. Existing international conventions on corruption do not go far enough in addressing that malaise. It is time to return the looted wealth to its rightful owners, namely, the people, and to hold both the perpetrators and their abettors accountable.\nThird, climate change poses serious challenges to all States. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change must not be allowed to be held hostage to sectoral interests.  Even  as  Pakistan contributes  minimally to\n \nglobal emissions, our country remains among the most vulnerable. Our Government completed the planting of one billion trees \u2014 a project in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. We have now launched an ambitious project to plant 10 billion trees across all of Pakistan.\nFourth, a rules-based global order is vital for the promotion of international trade in goods and services, as well as global nuclear commerce and governance mechanisms. Carving out exemptions and bending established  rules  to  suit partisan   interests   must be eschewed.\nFifth, objective and transparent criteria must be developed to facilitate trade in strategic goods and membership in the groupings that govern it. That is essential for countries pursuing  economic  growth and development.\nSixth, the sanctity and integrity of international agreements must be maintained. Strategic stability must be nurtured by policies of restraint and responsibility, not by considerations of profits and politics.\nSeventh, technology and innovation are key to reshaping our States and societies. We must strike a prudent balance between guarding against the misuse of emerging technologies and facilitating access to them on the part of developing countries. It is essential to develop universally agreed legal frameworks  in  the area of cybersecurity, lethal autonomous weapons systems, artificial intelligence and the weaponization of outer space.\nEighth, the dislocation of people in recent years, primarily because of wars but also as a result of pervasive poverty, has energized the global debate on refugees and migrants. The deliberations leading to the global compacts on  refugees and migrants represent  a step in the right direction. The true litmus test of those compacts lies in the effective  implementation  of commitments.\nPakistan believes that a new consensus on peace, security and development can and should be developed. A new paradigm for  universal peace and  prosperity  is both desirable and achievable. Pakistan will be a willing and able partner to the international community in that worthwhile pursuit. The challenges ahead are daunting; the road forward is untravelled, and the route is uncharted. These times call for deliberation and diligence, but also for cooperation and concerted action. They call for a truly united United Nations.\nThe Kashmiri wife who lost her husband, the Kashmiri school boy who lost his eyesight and his future to pellet-gun injuries, the Syrian father who saw his child drown, the Palestinian girl who suffocates under siege, and the African migrant willing to risk all for a better life continue to look to the United Nations for support and succour. Let us not fail them any longer."

        "file_text": "All of us here are heirs to the great hope to save future generations from the scourge of war, to build an international order based on law and respect for one\u2019s word, and to lead humankind towards economic, social and moral progress in increasingly secure freedom. We have seen results. The enjoyment of human rights has spread, trade and prosperity have grown, and poverty has declined. That has been our achievement of the past several decades.\nWe must, however, look honestly at the moment in which we are living. We are experiencing today a deep crisis in the liberal Westphalian international order, which we have known. First, that is because, in part,  it has failed to regulate itself, and to date no solution commensurate with the task of meeting its economic, financial, environmental and climatic failures has been found. Secondly, it is because our collective capacity to\n \nrespond to crises too often continues to be hindered by divisions within the Security Council. Our Organization is too often reduced to deploring the violations of rights that it has pledged to guarantee. Seventy years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly in Paris, a cultural, historical and religious relativism is now challenging the foundations of their universality.\nBorn of hope, the United Nations can become, like the League of Nations that  preceded  it,  the  symbol of powerlessness. We need not look far to see who is responsible for that crime. They are in this Assembly Hall. They are speaking today. We, the leaders, are responsible. On that basis, I see three main paths for us to follow.\nThe first path is to think that this is just a passing moment, a historical parenthesis before we return to life as normal. I do not believe that to be the case. I do not believe it because we are going through a crisis of effectiveness and principles in our contemporary world order, which will not be able to restore its previous landmarks and modes of functioning. This moment in time is not a parenthesis; it is a manifestation of our own failures of the past.\nThe second path would be that of the law of the strongest. Everyone is tempted to follow their own law. That path \u2014 the path of unilateralism \u2014 leads directly to isolation and conflict, to widespread clashes with everyone pitted against each other, to the detriment of all, even ultimately those who believe themselves to be the strongest. The responsibility for peace cannot be delegated; it cannot be refused; it cannot be pre-empted. It must be exercised collectively.\nThe law of the strongest does not protect any people from any threat, be it chemical or nuclear. What will truly resolve the situation in Iran and what has already begun to stabilize it? Was it the law of the strongest, the pressure of one individual? No. We know that Iran was on the path to military nuclear power, but what stopped it was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed in Vienna in 2015. Today, as I said a year ago (see A/72/PV.4), we must not exacerbate regional tensions, but rather put forth a broader agenda that addresses all the nuclear, ballistic and regional concerns caused by Iranian policies. We must do so through dialogue and multilateralism, without naivety or complacency, but also without posturing, which would be pointless.\n The problem of trade imbalances and their consequences for our societies will be solved by common rules adapted to today\u2019s reality that make it possible to ensure fair competition on an equal footing, and under no circumstances will a bilateral approach to all our trade disputes or new protectionism do so.\nWhat will resolve the crisis between Israel and Palestine is definitely not unilateral initiatives, or ignoring Palestinians\u2019 legitimate right to  lasting peace, or underestimating Israelis\u2019 legitimate right to their security. There is no credible alternative to two States living side by side in peace and security, with Jerusalem as their capital. Israel knows that France is unwavering in its friendship, and it is in the name of that friendship that I call for a quick end to the policy of faits accomplis that threaten the very possibility of reaching a peace agreement. Continuing along that path would be a mistake. On that issue, I am ready, and we must all stand ready, to move beyond dogmas and historical positions in order to take new initiatives, on the condition that it leads to positive changes on the ground. There too, the law of the strongest will only exacerbate frustration and violence. As the Assembly has seen, in the face of  contemporary imbalances, I  do not believe in the law of the strongest, even if it is masked in a form of legitimacy where it has actually lost all claims to legality.\nI believe that there is a third possible path ahead of us, probably the most difficult and the most demanding, which requires us to forge a new model and to find a new global balance together. After the Second World War, a balance was built bloc by bloc over the course of decades. Then there was the emergence of a model based on hyperpower. For several years now, we have witnessed a new global instability characterized by the return of multiple centres of power.\nThe new balance that we must create must be based on new forms of regional and international cooperation and will, in my opinion, be structured around three principles. The first is respect for sovereignty, which is at the very heart of the Charter of the United Nations. The second is the strengthening of our regional cooperation. The third is the provision of more robust international guarantees or safeguards. It is through that method, and on the basis of those three principles, that we must manage contemporary crisis situations.\nIn Syria, we are pursuing the fight against Islamist terrorism. The military engagements of some countries\n \nhave allowed the regime to recover at the expense of crimes for which those responsible will one day have to account. The Syrian people have, tragically, paid the price, and there will be no winners in a Syria in ruins. What is needed now is to win peace under the auspices of the United Nations. We cannot decide for the Syrian people, but we must rather build the ways and means of the method that I have just defined and thereby build a solution supported not only by the Astana guarantors, but also by other States of the region and the international community through the Small Group on Syria, under the coordination of the United Nations and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, in order to create the means both to resolve the humanitarian crisis and to build an inclusive, lasting political solution through constitutional reform and the holding of free elections. That is what it means to truly respect Syrian sovereignty. It is neither a substitute for the Syrian people in deciding who should be their leader nor an agreement to cover all crimes by accepting that this leader will remain until the end of time, considering that all principles and, ultimately, all law have been cast aside.\nIn Libya, too, it is that new method that should enable us to achieve a lasting solution. The current status quo allows militias and traffickers to gain ground, which destabilizes the entire region. We will not give the Libyans a way out of the crisis if we remain divided and if Libya becomes a stage, as it still is too often, for confrontations among  foreign  influences. In Paris, the Libyans recently pledged to hold early elections, which will make it possible to reunify State institutions. Those commitments must be fulfilled under the auspices of the United Nations and in close cooperation with the African Union. Yesterday, an important step was taken that I wish to  commend here. It is in the interests of Libyans, their neighbours, Europeans and the international community, who must be united around those objectives to move forward in that way.\nWe are all strong together in the face of terrorism when States are able to count on their own forces to ensure their security and when such security is based on regional and international solutions, in accordance with the principle I have justset out. That is the decision taken by the States of the Sahel, acting together in the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel. That was also the essence of the process launched by the African Union to better assume its responsibilities by deploying\nAfrican peacekeeping operations. That is the essence of the initiatives undertaken in the Lake Chad region, together with Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon, with the support of the African Union. That is why we must support the African Union\u2019s initiative and push for better coordination between the African Union and the United Nations. I hope that, by the end of the year, a resolution can be adopted to that effect.\nWe are strong in the face of terrorism when we take joint responsibility to fight all its forms of financing, and when, as we do in the Alliance for the Sahel, we act together for development, agriculture and education, and against the root causes of despair that have allowed terrorists to win hearts and minds. Some $7.5 billion has already been committed to 500 projects defined jointly with all the States concerned and the partners of the Alliance for the Sahel. We must consolidate those initial results.\nAs is evident from each of these crises, the answer has not been to leave States alone, to act for them or to proclaim from here the law or solution to be applied, but to know how to conscientiously articulate the principles of the sovereignty of peoples, regional cooperation and the real commitment of the international community. Those three principles form the basis for modern solutions. Only collective action can preserve the sovereignty and equality of the peoples that have given us a mandate. We also need collective action in the face of the demographic, climate and digital challenges before us, which none of us can face alone.\nConfronted with the great challenges posed by migration, I do not believe in talk of unconditional openness, which only sparks concern and stokes intolerance. Nor do I believe in the misleading speeches of those who claim, for example, in Europe as elsewhere, that they will be safer behind the protection of a closed border. That is not true. The only effective way to manage the migratory flows affecting all our continents in an organized and controlled manner is to create the conditions for elective rather than forced international mobility, to work together \u2014 countries of origin, transit and destination \u2014 to address the  root  causes of migration, especially for its victims, to dismantle trafficking networks that are the worst scourge of this phenomenon, and to protect our borders in a respectful manner while ensuring compliance with international law and, in particular, the unconditional protection of those who are entitled to asylum. That is what we have decided to do together through the United Nations pact\n \nthat is to be adopted in Marrakech in December, which I support.\nWith regard to climate change, too, there are no free rides or easy solutions either. Even those who have challenged that reality suffer its consequences like everyone else. Extreme weather events are now a daily occurrence. And by weakening collective action, some only expose themselves further.\nAs for the great digital transformation, here too our duty is to stand together to build modern rules that will allow us to reconcile the development of artificial intelligence with our ethical rules in order to support the digital transformation of our societies.\nI firmly believe in the sovereignty of peoples, which today is strong and demanded by all our peoples in the international arena. It also enjoys enhanced cooperation in many forms and a renewed legitimacy of international commitment. The great fight of our elders was achieving peace, and this remains one of our responsibilities. We will win that fight in the twenty- first century only by restoring a robust multilateralism that is truly capable not only of resolving conflicts pragmatically but, also and more broadly, of addressing their causes.\nTo tell the truth, I do not believe in one great globalized people. That is an illusion. It does not exist. But I do believe in universal values, and on that point we must not compromise. It is not the same thing. I believe in the non-negotiable defence of our values: human rights, the dignity of individuals and gender equality. I believe in our ability to strike a balance that respects peoples and cultures by refusing to negotiate those universal values. That is the reality, and I will in no way leave the principle of the sovereignty of peoples in the hands of nationalists or those who today, before the international community, advocate withdrawal and wish to exploit the sovereignty of peoples to challenge the universality and strength of our values, thanks to which we are all gathered here together in this Hall.\nAll of us here, even those who criticize it, have benefited from the structuring of the international order that has accompanied globalization. We have enjoyed a period of humanism and have all played a role in making it happen. Today, we must tackle the root causes of our imbalances. Together, we must face the weaknesses of our international order and, beyond the crises I have just mentioned, consider the deep inequalities that have taken root. In my view, that is the\nheart of our problem today. What awakens nationalism? What gives rise to doubt in our Assembly? What gives rise crises everywhere? It is those deep inequalities that we have failed to address.\nTen years ago, when the international financial crisis hit, we took emergency action, but we did not solve the root cause. We did not curb the trend of hyperconcentration of wealth on our planet, and we did not truly provide a response to all those left behind by globalization. All those who were marginalized now hold a grudge because of the humiliations they suffered or have been plunged into despair, for which we are now collectively paying the price. We owe all those people a response.\nWe owe a response to the 265 million children who do not have access to school, more than half of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, and to the young girls who have equal access to education in less than 40 per cent of countries.\nWe owe a response to the 700 million children who live in the regions most exposed to the consequences of climate change \u2014 the victims of floods, droughts, rising sea levels and the depletion of resources.\nWe owe a response to the 200 million women who do not have  access to contraception, to the more than 1 billion women who are not protected by law if they are victims of violence in their homes, and to all women whose global average pay is 23 per cent less than men and up to 40 per cent in rural areas.\nWe owe a response to the 783 million people living below the poverty line, to those suffering from hunger or chronic malnutrition and to those who do not have access to basic health care.\nWe owe a response to the aspirations of the most important generation of young people in history \u2014 our own young people \u2014 amounting to nearly 2 billion people who are now between the ages of 10 and 24, and 90 per cent of whom live in developing countries.\nWe owe a response to all those who look to us because their destiny depends on what we are or are not able to do here together in the Assembly.  And those who forget that we owe an answer to all those people are wrong because they are sowing the seeds for tomorrow\u2019s crises and because they will leave their children and ours in a much worse situation than we are in today.\n \nWe have made great progress in reducing inequalities among our countries, and we  have created the framework for  that in the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development, but the fight is not behind us. It is far from over. Wealth per capita is 50 times higher in the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development than in low- income countries. Do we think that we can sustainably increase stability and balance in this state of affairs? No, we must take action. That is why, as I announced here last year (see A/72/PV.4), I have decided to increase France\u2019s official development assistance by\n\u20ac1 billion starting in 2019. Our humanitarian funding will increase by 40 per cent. But it is also why the fight against inequality will be the priority of the French presidency of the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in 2019. After Canada, whose leadership I applaud, France will assume the G-7\u2019s next presidency. I would like to have a major reconsideration of its format in order to improve its association with various other Powers and devise new ways to coordinate.\nI also wanted it to be at the United Nations that I made the first announcement that the inequality agenda will be at the centre of the next G-7, and also that I intend to report on the results of the Biarritz G-7 next September, because the time when a club of rich countries could define the balances of power in the  world  by  itself has long since passed and because it is impossible to separate the fate of each of its members from that of all the States members of the Assembly. We must tackle modern inequalities today because they are at the root of the evil that I denounced at the beginning of my statement. We must address inequalities of opportunity, which are a moral aberration and an unsustainable reality. We cannot accept a world in which people do not have the same opportunities because of the country where they were born, or cannot go to school in certain countries because they are women, or do not have access to basic services.\nWe kept the commitment made here last year with the President of Senegal. The Global Partnership for Education Financing Conference, held in February in Dakar, raised $2.5 billion to increase access to education around the world. That is a historic amount. France has increased its contribution tenfold. The mobilization of the G-7 already begun under the Canadian presidency should make it possible to go even  further. We  are at a key moment on  this issue that will decide whether or not we are capable of dealing with the challenge we\nface. Between now and 2030 there will be 620 million more children needing schooling worldwide, including 444 million Africans. Are we going to provide for that? Are we going to give them all that they need for a solid foundation that will enable them to be agents for their own lives, to live as brothers in tomorrow\u2019s world? If not, what kind of world are we creating? That is why I have committed France to this fight and why I insist so much on teacher training, vocational training and gender equality in education. That is why I urge everyone here to join in this great global surge for education. Education and health will not only be the pillars of our societies in the twenty-first century, they will be the fundamental building blocks of our economies.\nWe must also fight diligently against gender inequality. In France I have made this the signature issue of my five-year term, and I am launching an appeal here to make it a major global issue. Women and girls are the first of us to be affected by poverty, conflict and the consequences of global warming. They are the primary victims of gender-based and sexual violence, which too often hinders their freedom of movement and their ability to work and have control over their bodies. It is our responsibility in the twenty- first century to put an end to such violence, from street harassment to femicide. It is time for our world to stop victimizing women and finally make a place for them, one that they deserve, one where they can be leaders. We must ensure that they have access to education, health care, employment and economic and political decision-making everywhere, and we must fight all forms of violence against them. France therefore proposes to those Governments that want to move forward with us the creation of a coalition for enacting new legislation on equality between women and men. Fifty per cent of our development assistance will be devoted to projects aimed at reducing gender inequality.\nWe must also mobilize against health inequality at the international level. In Lyon in 2019 we will host the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Replenishment Conference. We will take up the initiative on the fight against counterfeit medicines and will intensify our response to major pandemics. I call on everyone here to mobilize.\nLastly, we must fight urgently, body and soul, against environmental inequality. It is unacceptable that 45 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions are produced by 10 per cent of the planet\u2019s richest inhabitants. As is the case with solar energy, we have an inefficient situation\n \nwhen the countries with the greatest potential and needs have the least access to appropriate technologies. It is unsustainable that 100 million more people will be condemned to extreme poverty by 2030 if we fail  to meet our commitments to fighting global warming. Here too we must be united in combat. Some countries represented here are suffering more than others, and we owe them our solidarity. But we will all be held accountable for the disasters that are multiplying before our very eyes, before our peoples and our own children. The proclaimed breakdown of the Paris Climate Change Agreement has been thwarted because we have been able to remain united, despite the decision of the United States to withdraw from it. That strength must continue to support us and help us to ward off all the fatalistic predictions.\nWe are told that solutions exist but that the funding is lacking. So let us go find it, let us innovate. This is what we did last year in Paris, on 12 December, with many of those gathered here, at the One Planet Summit, with concrete commitments and first results. That is what we did at the beginning of the year in Delhi, with the International Solar Alliance. That is what we will do again tomorrow in New York, at the second One Planet Summit. We are told that it is already too late, that we cannot meet the goals. So let us speed up, let us together adopt the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement in December at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Let us implement the protocol against hydrofluorocarbon gases, which could enable us to reduce the average global temperature by one degree by 2050. Let us set ourselves the goal of concluding an ambitious draft global environmental pact by 2020, and ensuring that the Beijing Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2020 International Union for Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in France will be decisive steps.\nLet us make a  clear commitment, and let  us all be equally clear, concrete and consistent. This is an emergency. So let us honour the commitments we  have made. Let us no longer sign trade agreements with Powers that do not respect the Paris Agreement. Let us ensure that our business commitments integrate our environmental and social constraints. Let us work harder to involve sovereign wealth funds and financiers in this low-carbon-policy strategy. France will continue to be a global leader in this fight alongside everyone who  wants to join. We  will work  in the G-7  to ensure\nthat the commitments made at the 2015 Climate Change Conference are increased, and if one of our members does not want to move forward, we will move forward anyway by seeking new coalitions and new formats, because the G-7\u2019s mission is to remain a united group of countries committed to democracy. But today it must also contribute to the creation of new coalitions that will make it possible to improve and restructure the collective global system. So let us build new forms of cooperation to make progress and  take decisions  on those fundamental issues. Only together can we effectively fight the inequalities that have fractured all of our societies and that have fuelled mistrust and the temptation to withdraw \u2014 inequalities that we have allowed to grow and to which we have been collectively unable to respond effectively.\nBut none of us can effectively fight the inequalities I have decried if we act alone. If we do, there are essentially only two solutions. The first is to continually lower the bar and revert to the standards that we know, as we have been doing for decades. We have a trade war, so let us reduce workers\u2019 rights, keep cutting taxes and fuel our inequalities that way in an effort to respond to our trade problems. What does that lead to? It reinforces the inequalities in our societies and the disruption that we are living through. The alternative is to say that it is the rules that are not working, so we should retreat inwards towards isolationism and protectionism. But the only thing that leads to is heightened tensions, which do nothing to address serious inequalities.\nWhat I am proposing instead is that we put in place a collective mechanism to enable us to work together on what we are doing in each of our countries to reduce inequalities, to evaluate our actions but also to coordinate them better and to disseminate best practices. I therefore propose that international institutions \u2014 the United Nations, but the OECD as well, of course \u2014 support us in setting up such a mechanism, for which the G-7 must be the driving force.\nTo defeat inequality, we must change our methods. First, we should revise both our trade and social rules. Rather than pursuing protectionism, we should all work together to thoroughly review the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. We must restore the WTO\u2019s ability to resolve conflicts and establish rules for the unfair trade practices, non-compliance with intellectual property rights and forced technology transfers that make a level playing field impossible. Starting this year, the Group of Twenty summit in Argentina must provide\n \nus with a credible road map for rebuilding the WTO. That is also what we will have to do on the social front next year, during the centenary of the International Labour Organization.\nSecondly, we must also change the modalities of our action, bringing into the scope of our collective action the major  players who are not  in this Hall or  at the General Assembly, the big  non-State  actors who are helping to change the world but who do not participate enough in reducing the inequalities that these transformations bring, and by that I mean the major  digital players, both in terms of taxation and  of responsibility for combating the manipulation of information. We need to  operate  differently  from  our standard collective action where all our major challenges are concerned and include dialogue with these new private stakeholders and Internet giants.\nThirdly, we must enable Africa to take its rightful place so that it can play a central part in rebuilding the international system. It is not only on that continent that we will collectively win or lose our great battle against inequality \u2014 it is with that continent, because today it is in Africa that we find the most fervent defenders of multilateralism and regional integration. Our African partners have fully understood that we can only meet our common challenges together. And this new alliance with Africa will also be a focus of the French presidency of the G-7.\nI  firmly  believe  that  despite  these  fractures and challenges in the modern  world  order,  we  can put together a new vocabulary for action while also addressing the root causes of inequality today. And it is the responsibility of France and all its European partners, of the European Union, to be in the vanguard in this fight, to build a new, modern humanism that refuses to yield to attempts to withdraw or to simple-mindedness and at the same time, as mediating Powers, to build these new rules for the international order.\nAt a  time when our collective system is cracking, I have to say that we have never needed it so much. That is why we will support the agencies working on projects for peace and humanity \u2014 UNESCO, the conscience of the United Nations; the Human Rights Council; the International Criminal Court; the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, to which we will increase our contribution \u2014 because, I want to remind the Assembly, we are simply talking  about enabling\nhundreds of thousands of children to go to school, nothing less, nothing more.\nWe will defend expanding both member categories of the Security Council so that its composition reflects today\u2019s balances of power and so that it is strengthened as a forum for consultation rather than obstruction. We will ensure that by the end of the year, two thirds of the members of the General Assembly can support limiting the right of veto in the case of mass atrocities. We will defend international humanitarian law by supporting staff who take extraordinary risks to help civilians on the ground by negotiating humanitarian access to all theatres, one by one.\nOn the seventieth anniversary of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we will remind the world that human rights are not a cultural thing. They are not simply values or revocable options, but a legal corpus enshrined in international treaties to which the members of the Assembly have freely consented. We will point out that their universality not only does not run counter to a people\u2019s sovereignty, it is rather the only way to ensure the preservation and exercise of those rights.\nFrance will be there to ensure that the world does not forget that clashing nationalisms only plunge us into the abyss, that when democracies lack the courage to defend their principles, they are weak, and that accumulated resentments, backed only by a fragile international system, can result in a global unleashing of violence twice in the space of one human life. I am speaking from our own experience. In a few weeks\u2019 time, on 11 November, the Paris Peace Forum will present an opportunity for us to see a surge of thoughtfulness and courage as we attempt to rediscover what keeps us together here. For us, united by the tragedies of the twentieth century, it should be a time for renewal and to rediscover the oath we have taken to save future generations from the scourge of war. I want us and our counterparts to take on new responsibilities during the Forum in order to chart the way for concrete actions in the service of peace.\nI know that many of us may be tired of multilateralism. In a world that is flooded with information and in which in a sense we are in a free-for-all, in which society is a reality show where it is fashionable and newsworthy to say the worst possible things, I know that denouncing the consequences of causes we have championed can be a successful political tactic and\n \nthat defending cooperation and multilateralism may no longer be fashionable. Then let us not be fashionable, because we have a duty to those who have made it possible for us to sit in this Hall. Because we must never forget that the genocides that are the reason we are here today were fuelled by the speeches that we are growing accustomed to, by the political spectacles that we applaud. Because we are now seeing international law and every kind of cooperation disintegrate, as if it was nothing, out of fear and complicity and because it looks good.\nBut I will not do that. I will not do it, because I come from a country that helped to create the declarations that have brought us here, because I come from a country that stands tall, and while it has made many mistakes and done many bad things, it has been able to maintain a kind of universalism at every point in its own history and in international history. This is today. This is now. So we must not get used to it. We must not accept all these kinds of unilateralism. Every day pages are being ripped in a betrayal of our history. And I am not going to get used to it.\nThis is what I have to say, very clearly. This nascent century is watching us, and our children are waiting. We must resolve our crises. We must work together to combat all our inequalities, but let us do so on a human level and in full accord with our principles, our histories and our universalism. In any case, that is my commitment to everyone here, and I am counting on us all.\n"

        "file_text": "The two speakers whom the Assembly heard this afternoon immediately  before  me have said it all for me and my country (see A/73/ PV.10). The fact is that I do not have to say a word here, because they said it so well. But I am bound by duty   to my country to say a few words in order to justify  the cost of my trip to New York. I know that everyone is tired, and I know that it is afternoon, but I ask the Assembly to bear with me.\nThe Organization needs good leadership, and I am sure that you will take us in the right direction, Madam President. I offer my congratulations to you and to the\n \npeople of Ecuador on your election to lead us during this session of the General Assembly.\nAs I said before, New Zealand has spoken eloquently about the fate of the Pacific island countries in the face of the imminent threat of climate change.\nWhen the armed conflicts that dominated the world in the first four decades of the previous century ended, the world slipped into another war, the Cold War. It was a period of suspicion and deceit, an era deeply rooted in clandestine engagement that reminds us of what Winston Churchill once said: \u201c[T]ruth is so precious she should always be attended by a bodyguard  of  lies.\u201d That resonates with us today, given the various applications of that term. We see the fight continuing today, but it is now waged between the bigger and richer nations, armed with the might of wealth and guided by the principle and the notion that might makes right. The smaller economies are now aligned and marginalized, once again becoming the spoils of what is now an economic war fostering new, economic colonies. As in all wars, many people become innocent victims and are often filed away simply as collateral damage or spoils of war, becoming the possessions of the victors and allies.\nWe are opening another session of the General Assembly with our world facing record and serious challenges. And yet, we dared to ask ourselves this morning whether Pluto was a planet. How is that relevant to what we face today in the world? Perhaps Pluto can wait.\nOur aim today must be to improve upon the United Nations as the forum in which we work to prevent all\nthis from continuing. We must seek curative measures to slow and, if possible, stop the economic war, hopefully with the goal of accelerating efforts to close the gap of economic imbalance. We must also avoid deliberate procrastination motivated by geopolitical greed for dominance and economic imperialism. Such a state only brings pain and misery to those whose only fault is to be in the way. We must recommend what the future should hold for us.\nWe the Members of the United Nations must adopt a more progressive attitude towards taking charge of our own affairs and making sure that we are directly involved in matters that touch and impact our lives. The existential threat of climate change is becoming more real with every hurricane, wildfire, heatwave and centimetre of sea-level rise. Those are the realities that many of us are seeing and experiencing. Islands within the Federated States, islands in Marshall Islands, and islands in Tuvalu and Kiribati will be among the first to literally disappear.\nIn 2009, Micronesia proposed a fast-action strategy using the Montreal Protocol to explicitly cut climate emissions so as to avoid a warming of 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century. While it may sound like a small figure, it is 50 per cent more than the warming that we are experiencing today. In order to achieve that goal, we urge all countries that have not yet done so to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. I ask all my friends, leaders of their countries, from the bottom of my heart to accelerate the process to join the Montreal Protocol so that we can begin the implementation of what needs to be done in order to save this planet.\nOn our current trajectory, many more islands will be lost, many homes will be destroyed and many people will be displaced. But we can still avoid the worst climate impacts if we recognize the need for speed  and take fast action. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change may have shortcomings, but believe me, it is the best platform for achieving our goal. We believe that, no matter how difficult or sensitive the issues associated with climate change, we need everyone on board. My country is disappointed that some countries are considering withdrawing from the Agreement, and we call on them to reconsider.\nMicronesia is a large ocean State blessed with abundant marine  resources. A key concern for Micronesia \u2014 and all small island developing States \u2014 is rightly focused on ensuring a healthy, productive and\n \nresilient ocean. The resources of the ocean are the bedrock of the Micronesian nations and livelihoods. A sizeable percentage of our economies comes from our ocean-based activities, whether fisheries, tourism or maritime transport.\nMicronesia is committed to the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\u2019 declaration aimed  at  safeguarding  the ocean and its resources. I join my fellow Pacific leaders as we commit to eliminating marine  litter  and recommend the urgent implementation of the Pacific marine litter action plan. For Micronesia, our fisheries are critical to the socioeconomic well-being of our people.\nWhile we welcome the recent decision by the International Law Commission to place the topic \u201cSea- Level Rise in Relation to International Law\u201d on its long- term programme of work, may I strongly recommend that the subject be placed on the Commission\u2019s active programme of work,  given  the  direct  implications of sea-level rise  on  maritime  baselines  and  maritime boundaries.\nThe wish for peace is global; it should have no boundaries. Micronesia is encouraged by the peace reached by Eritrea and Ethiopia, and we wish the people of those countries the very best. I think that it is time that we congratulate those countries on achieving that wonderful result. We also hope that other countries that are engaged in conflicts achieve similar resolutions, and soon.\nIn our region of the world, we have a stake in the ongoing peace negotiations between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. We recognize and encourage the continuing efforts to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula. A lasting peace on the peninsula translates into a more secure and stable Pacific region.\nElsewhere in the world, we cannot ignore the pain and suffering of the many people caught in pockets of armed conflict. As world leaders, we have fallen short in our efforts to fulfil our responsibilities. It is deeply troubling to see those who wield tremendous power fail to take bold and decisive actions to end such serious atrocities. We wonder if, for some unknown reason, such conflicts might be good for those powerful States, either politically or even economically \u2014 what a shame if they were to think so.\nThe United Nations needs to be relevant and able and willing to deal with emerging threats. We find it deeply troubling that the threat posed by climate change to our existence has not received the Security Council\u2019s consideration. The Pacific small island developing States have made a proposal for consideration by the Council. While the proposal itself will not immediately save our islands, it is nevertheless a step in the right direction. I happen to feel that if Micronesia were a member of the Security Council, we would do a lot better than some of the current ones. Micronesia believes that a Security Council, as conceived in this century, needs to become more efficient, more representative and more responsive and must show greater leadership in its response to today\u2019s challenges.\nMicronesia welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s objective to reposition the United Nations development system in order to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The United Nations development  system has impact and influence when it is focused. It is of the utmost importance that its operational activities for development take into account the need to build, promote and strengthen the capacities of small island developing countries.\nFor Micronesia, the role of the United Nations development system \u2014 and particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \u2014 to support and enhance the capacity of island countries to implement the 2030 Agenda must not be overlooked. However, that requires the scaling up of the UNDP presence, particularly in our North Pacific, where that presence can make a real difference and be a crucial factor in our development efforts.\nIn closing, the United Nations represents the best hope for humankind, and we, the Member States, must ensure that it remains so.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to greet you personally, Madam President, on behalf of my country and my people.\nAt the outset, I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his successful work over the past year as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would also like to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, who has taken over the presidency of the General Assembly. I hope and pray that this year\u2019s General Assembly session will avail us of an opportunity to bring the best to all people of the world.\nWe are holding this meeting on the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. The League of Nations, which was founded after the war, was immediately replaced by the United Nations  in the aftermath of the Second World War. Undoubtedly, the United Nations, over its 73 years of history, has carried out enormous endeavours and achieved great successes. However, we also need to admit the fact that over time the capacity of the United Nations to meet the expectations of humankind for peace and welfare has diminished.\nIn particular, the Security Council has taken to serving only the interests of its five permanent seat- holders, which have veto rights, while standing by idly in the face of oppression in other parts of the world. The massacres in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda and Somalia, and recently in Myanmar and occurring in Palestine as we speak, have all taken place before the eyes of the Security Council. Those who remain silent in the face of the oppression of the Palestinians, those who have reduced humanitarian assistance for them,\nare only increasing the courage of the oppressors. Even if the whole world turns its back, Turkey will continue to be on the side of the oppressed Palestinians and will protect the historical and legal status of our first qibla, which is Jerusalem.\nUnfortunately, in many parts of the world, every day we confront scenes of ethnic cleansing and mass slaughter that none of us would wish to see. Likewise, from health to education, from food to  culture, there is a high level of dissatisfaction in terms of the sum of the work undertaken by this huge Organization. We do not wish to see such an important structure turn into an organization with a constant reputation for failure and complaints. Therefore, on every occasion, we underline that there needs to be a comprehensive reform in the structure and functioning of the United Nations, particularly of the Security Council.\nWe believe that when we say \u201cthe world is greater than five\u201d we are becoming the voice of the common conscience of the entire human race. The world is not the world of the times of the Second World War,  nor of its aftermath. We have representatives from 194 countries under this roof. Why cannot 194 countries be represented at the Security Council? Why should they not, in a rotational manner, have their permanent seats in the Security Council? We have only five permanent seat-holders at the Security Council, and the remainder are just temporary with no power whatsoever.\nLimiting the reform of the United Nations to the budget will neither contribute to the settlement of real problems nor make anybody happy or content. There is a need to increase the efficiency of the Organization, which I deem to be very important for the future of  the world. That includes in the fundamental areas of social equality, development and security. We need to undertake many reforms.\nWhen Turkey looks at the world \u2014 beginning  with our own geography \u2014 we see that there  are many important tasks to be undertaken by the United Nations. In our understanding, justice is above all, and it will bring order, salvation and happiness to the entire world. In our civilization we refer to a phenomenon known as the \u201ccircle of justice,\u201d which is based on a correct establishment and management of relations between the society, the law, the State, the power of the State, the economy and justice. The links of that circle are intertwined; however, those links are shattered regardless of where you go in the world today. That is\n \nwhy our world today is entrapped by political, social and economic instability and is constantly suffering.\nTo enable a peaceful and secure  future  for  all, we have a duty to succeed in humankind\u2019s struggle, starting with the search for justice and ending with the establishment of justice. Today, when the assets of the wealthiest 62 people in the world amount to the assets of half of world\u2019s population of 3.6 billion people, it means there is a significant problem that we need to do something about. Every night 821 million people go to bed hungry; at the same time more than 672 million have been diagnosed with obesity. There is a problem with that. There are 258 million people across the world hitting the road in search for better conditions  to live and survive. And there are 68 million displaced people around the world, which points to yet another outstanding problem that we need to do something about. There is a problem when the likelihood of early child mortality of a baby born in Africa is nine times greater than that of a baby born here.\nThe famous Islamic philosopher Rumi,  who began shining a beacon from the city of Konya, in the heartland of Anatolia, in order to enlighten all souls across the world, once said that justice means restoring things to their proper place \u2014 that is. giving someone what he or she needs or desires. Let us establish a global administration system that will serve as a shield to protect the oppressed, the victimized, lending a helping hand to the hungry and the unsheltered, and thereby bringing hope to future generations.\nEverything said from this rostrum, all the analyses and proposals that we come up with, will make sense only if we can put them into action. Again, according to the philosopher Rumi, an oppressor is someone who does not fulfil their duties vis-\u00e0-vis humankind. If we want to make the United Nations a source of justice instead of cruelty, we have to dedicate ourselves more fully to the tasks bestowed upon us.\nTurkey is sustaining its efforts aimed at achieving a fairer world through its global humanitarian diplomacy. We are currently hosting 4 million refugees inside our borders, 3.5 million of whom came from Syria. On a global scale, this is unprecedented. Those refugees have access to all forms of services that one could ever need. So  far, the Republic of  Turkey  has spent  about\n$32 billion for the care of refugees. Furthermore, in cities such as Jarablus, Al-Rai and Afrin in Syria, which we previously secured, we have provided humanitarian\naid to millions of people in need just as has been done in the de-escalation zones that were recently declared in the city of Idlib.\nThe number of Syrian students attending school  in Turkey is well above 600,000. Refugees in our country have access to all health-care services free of charge, just like any other Turkish citizen. In addition, we attend to all the needs of refugees in Turkish protection centres. However, so far, we have received only $600 million from international organizations and only \u20ac1.7 billion from the European Union (EU). Those funds are not going directly into the Turkish budget, but rather are being directly transferred to the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working for the refugees. The European Union previously pledged\n\u20ac3 billion to be allocated to Turkey, but that is now contingent upon the undertaking of specific projects. We continue providing our  services  to  refugees every day without any preconditions or interruptions whatsoever. We expect more generous and flexible support to be provided to Turkey, especially by the EU, because we have prevented a large refugee influx to spill over into other parts of the world,  in particular  to Europe, thanks to the opportunities we have made available to refugees.\nFurthermore, we are providing significant humanitarian development aid in all parts of the world, not just to refugees within or near our borders. As of this year, Turkey ranks sixth in  the  world  in  terms of total development aid and first in humanitarian assistance. Turkey ranks among the top donors in terms of development and humanitarian aid,  as  we are the seventeenth largest economy in the world. Our commitment is a strong expression of the degree of significance we attach to humanitarian aid and helping those in need.\nAs noted in the appeal by the General Assembly this year, our world needs global leadership and joint responsibility more than ever for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. Turkey has made substantial efforts in that direction within the United  Nations. The Mediation for Peace initiative, which we launched together with Finland in 2010, is now supported by  the Group of Friends of Mediation, which consists of 56 Member States. We have also taken serious steps forward in that regard within the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, over which we currently preside.\n \nThe Alliance of Civilizations initiative, which we launched with Spain, has become a United Nations initiative with the participation of 146 Member States. In helping Somalia, which is struggling with hunger, get  back on its feet, we  are currently implementing   a development programme that I believe will be a model for the rest of the world. And to help millions of innocent people in Arakan, which is miles away from our country, we have mobilized all our means and all our capabilities. We have exerted sincere efforts to resolve the Gulf crisis. In Iraq, we are encouraging all parties to make efforts to secure the future of the country. In terms of racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, we strive to prevent negativity from emerging in various parts of the world, especially in Europe.\nWe have also adopted an active stance in response to the developments taking place in Syria, which has now become a place where the majority of the countries in the world export the radical groups residing within their borders. By means of both our support to the Geneva and Astana processes and the de-escalation zones that have been established, we continue to try to bring peace and stability to Syria, and we are trying to make Syria a peaceful country once again. By clearing the Jarablus and Al-Rai regions of the presence of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and the Afrin region from the presence of the Kurdistan Workers Party, the Democratic Union Party and the People\u2019s Protection Units \u2014 terrorist organizations all \u2014 we have turned an area of more than 4,000 square kilometres into a safe and peaceful place for millions of Syrians.\nQuite recently, we signed an agreement with Russia, the Sochi Agreement, through which we have prevented the regime\u2019s bloody assaults against the de-escalation zones in Idlib province, where 3.5 million civilians live. It is our belief that, by preventing a repetition of the massacres previously carried out in Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Dar\u2019a and eastern Ghouta, Turkey has cleared the way for peace and a political solution in the country, especially in the Idlib. Our goal is to clear the Syrian territory of the presence of terrorists, all the  way  from Manbij to the Iraqi border. I hereby call upon all the parties to support a just and sustainable political solution in Syria through a constructive approach. We wish to see a principled approach taken against all terrorist organizations.\nThose who equip terrorists with tens of thousands of trucks and thousands of cargo planes loaded with arms and ammunition for the sake of their tactical interests\nwill most definitely feel sorrow and regret in future for having done so. Supporting terrorist organizations and closing borders to refugees, all the while putting the entire burden on a few countries like Turkey, will not give the world a more secure or prosperous future. On the contrary, issues deflected in such a way will reach a point where one day the measures at hand will fall short of overcoming them. So let us make more sincere and constructive efforts aimed  at  finding  solutions in regions currently in conflict, such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan and Ukraine, as well as in regions potentially in conflict, such as the Balkans, the Caucusus, North Africa, Central Africa, the Gulf and the eastern Mediterranean. Let us not forget that, if we cannot create a minimum level of peace and prosperity for all in every part of the world, no one can live safely within their own borders.\nNot all terrorist organizations obtain their power solely from their armed actions. Some of them use more complex, more convert and more deceptive methods. The Fethullah terrorist organization attempted a coup on the night of 15 July 2016, and, in the end, 251 Turkish civilians were martyred and more than 2,193 civilians were wounded. That is the sort of terrorist organization I was referring to just now. The Fethullah terrorist organization is hiding behind such glossy concepts as education, welfare and dialogue, and it continues its operations as NGOs or businesses. The leader of this terrorist organization is currently living in very comfortable fashion in Pennsylvania, on more than 400 acres of land.\nFor the last four decades, this terrorist organization has been growing and developing in Turkey through deception, and we saw its true face when  the terrorists felt that they had become powerful enough to undertake coups d\u2019\u00e9tat. They initiated consecutive attempts, first with their operatives who had infiltrated the police and the judiciary in Turkey, and then with their agents in the armed forces. With the economic and bureaucratic power they attained over time, that terrorist organization has attempted to take control of politics, society and the State itself. However, thanks to the support of our people and to our resolute fight against the Fethullah terrorist organization over the past five years, we have eliminated the majority of members of that organization in our country. We can now see that this terrorist organization is carrying out similar activities across the globe. We are warning many countries that are friends of Turkey around the\n \nworld and demanding the extradition of the terrorists hiding within their borders, but some of those countries are shying away from extraditing them. Ultimately, however, the price for such a failure will be quite hefty.\nThe Fethullah terrorist organization is generating between $700 million and $800 million in the United States through their charter schools located in different states throughout the country. That figure does not include the income generated by commercial institutions involved in all sorts of money laundering activities and other structures with secret agendas that appear to be NGOs. I am hurt, and that is why I am frankly warning countries that are friends of Turkey around the world. I invite them to mobilize their efforts to combat the presence of the Fethullah terrorist organization in their countries. We must show the same solidarity that we have shown with regard to armed terrorist organizations and bloodthirsty regimes with regard to that insidious gang as well. We are ready to share our experiences and the information we have gathered on that issue with countries that are friends of Turkey and any country that is willing to cooperate with us more closely.\nTrade wars have harmed humankind  in  every age. We are on the brink of another such frightening war. None of us can remain silent in the face of arbitrary cancellations of commercial  agreements,  the spreading prevalence of protectionism  and  the use of economic sanctions as weapons. The negative effects of those twisted developments will eventually affect all countries. We must all work together to prevent damage to the world trade regime as a result of unilateral decisions in the form of sanctions. At a time when we need to work towards the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, no one wants the world to experience a new economic rupture.\nIt is easy to create chaos, but it is difficult to restore order. Today, unfortunately, some  countries are persistently trying to create chaos. There is no bigger danger than a world order that has lost mercy, conscience, truth and hope. That is  the  danger  we are facing now. Turkey has always been in favour of both free trade and the free movement of persons and goods. Every regression in those areas has negative repercussions that will be hard to overcome for future generations. Furthermore, the fact that this approach is brought up with a rhetoric of threat, force and by entirely disregarding the history of bilateral relations disappoints us even more. We are in favour of solving our problems through constructive dialogue on equal\nterms. We expect responsible action by all our friends around the world.\nWe have effective, harmonious and constructive cooperation with our counterparts on international platforms, such as the World Trade Organization, the Group of 20, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the European Union in the form of the Customs Union. Turkey  has always  expressed its  support for  a win-win approach to those we do business with around the world. The sincerity of our approach is obvious, which is why we deem the allegations against and pressure on our country unfair. We believe that, together with the countries and institutions sharing our perspective, we can surmount the political and economic chaos that the world is being drawn into. We hope to receive the international community\u2019s support in that respect.\nBefore concluding my address, I would like to share with the Assembly two additional remarks.\nFirst, we believe that there is a need for an institution within the United Nations for youth, as young people ensure the sustainability of our future. Turkey proposes the establishment of a United Nations youth organization as soon as possible, and suggests Istanbul, a city that symbolizes the history of the world, as its headquarters. We can allocate a youth centre, which is currently being built in Istanbul, to that organization.\nSecondly, in 2005, we hosted the world ageing summit in Turkey for the first time, and then 2019 was designated the International Year of Older Persons. In that respect, the United Nations international agency for the elderly is being established in Istanbul, and the third World Assembly on Ageing will take place in Istanbul. I cordially invite representatives to attend that summit, which will be held on 10 December.\nOnce again, I wish every success to the General Assembly during its seventy-third session. On behalf of myself and my country, I wholeheartedly salute with respect all the countries and peoples represented in this common parliament of humankind. May they prevail in peace and in health.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by congratulating Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her recent assumption of the presidency of  the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, becoming only the fourth woman to take that seat and the first to represent her region. Palau welcomes her to that prominent role. I have no doubt that, as our captain on our voyage towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, she will steer this canoe in a unique and effective way. Let me also express my gratitude to His Excellency Minister Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his exceptional service during his recently completed term.\nI would also like to pay my respects to a great leader and humanitarian, our former Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kofi Annan. A friend and ally to all, Mr. Annan was the living embodiment of our mission to create peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. This year we also celebrate the legacy of Nelson Mandela, which continues to inspire the poor and the oppressed to demand equal rights. In honour of the centenary of his birth, the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit (see A/73/PV.4 and 5) was a historic opportunity to reaffirm our faith in the principles and values of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe Republic of Palau is committed to promoting peaceful, equitable  and  sustainable  societies  both at home and internationally. We see the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the most important framework for achieving that objective. The path that each country takes to achieve its goals will be unique, but we recognize that all are interlinked and reinforce one another. Palau\u2019s core priorities are health, oceans and climate change, through which the rest of our development objectives, through genuine and durable partnerships, will be realized.\nPalau has declared 2018 as a Year of Good Health. At home we are implementing a number of actions to raise awareness and to cultivate healthier lifestyles so as to respond to the deadly problem of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Palau is one of the 10 countries with the highest rates of obesity in the world. I am sorry to say that, while in other parts of the world people are dying of hunger and poverty, in our corner of the Pacific we are dying from overeating and a poor diet. The rise in the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other NCDs is attributed to unhealthy diets, insufficient physical activity, the excessive consumption of salt, sugar and fat and alcohol and tobacco use. NCDs are now the leading cause of death in Palau and, sadly, throughout the Pacific region. As many as 75 per cent of us will die prematurely from NCDs. The crisis has prompted a strategic shift in focus at Palau\u2019s Ministry of Health towards increasing preventive services in\n \nan effort to improve the health and livelihoods of our people. We are encouraging a return to traditional diets and increasing our local food production, as much of the problem stems from imports of unhealthy junk food. However, in the case of tuberculosis, I am very happy to report that the incidence of tuberculosis has been minimal and well under control for the past few years.\nFor my country, the ocean is our livelihood, our culture and our identity, which is why achieving SDG 14 is so critical for us. The ocean is also the foundation of our booming tourism industry, which will continue to be the largest provider of jobs in the country. We have launched a new campaign, Pristine Paradise Palau, which makes sustainability a top priority. I firmly believe that our environment is our economy and our economy is  our  environment.  Preserving our magnificent coral reefs and abundant fisheries will ensure that tourism continues to  grow,  as  well as protecting our food security for generations to come. For that reason, we have moved aggressively to implement our national marine sanctuary, a no-take zone that covers 80 per cent of our exclusive economic zone. It is Palau\u2019s contribution to the global effort to achieve SDG 14. The marine biodiversity endemic to Palau is priceless. We are therefore eager to work with the scientific community to identify more ways to build the resilience of our coral reef ecosystem.\nWe are proud of our domestic efforts but international action remains essential. Last year, the world gathered here in this great Hall and declared that the ocean was sick and needed our united global assistance to restore it to good health (see resolution 71/312). This year, in response to that call for help, Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway and I, together with representatives of the Governments of Australia, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Namibia and Portugal and the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy for the Ocean, launched the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy. The Panel seeks solutions for building a transformative political agenda for ocean action and the development of a platform to deliver the management and tracking of commitments, initiatives and partnerships, including science-based monitoring of the ocean, featuring national and private-sector leadership.\nPalau is also seeking a strong outcome to the intergovernmental conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, which will be an important complement to our domestic actions. Further out on the horizon, my country will be proud to play host to the Our Ocean 2020 Conference. That same year, Portugal will host the United Nations Ocean Conference. We must identify our priorities and catalyse new coalitions so that the year 2020 will indeed come to be remembered as a year of action.\nMy Government also takes very seriously its contribution to the Paris Agreement, which is also integral to our plans for achieving SDG 13 and other relevant goals. Climate change is the greatest challenge of our generation. Only this month we  once  again saw the damage that record-breaking cyclones cause vulnerable countries, as Super Typhoon Mangkhut did the Philippines. Building the resilience of vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change must be an urgent global priority.\nPalau has developed a climate change policy framework with the aim of undertaking effective adaptation measures to deal with the expected effects of climate change, strengthen our capacity to prepare and minimize disaster risks and mitigate climate change by working towards low-carbon emission through clean energy initiatives. Meanwhile, we continue to work with our global and regional partners to build capacity and mainstream climate change into our national planning and budgeting process. Small island developing States are indeed making great strides in transforming their energy systems.  As  part of  our  vision  for  building a pristine paradise, Palau has adopted ambitious international commitments to increase its supply of renewable energy by harnessing the power of the sun and transforming our energy sector to receive at least 45 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Smokestacks have no place in paradise. Let me say that again. Smokestacks have no place in paradise.\nOur target represents an extremely ambitious undertaking but we are confident that, with the right partners, we can achieve our goal. We take very seriously our responsibility to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as part of the global effort to limit the temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0 Celsius. While Palau emits a minuscule fraction of the global aggregate, we believe that the example we set can inspire many others to act. Earlier this year, we took a big step forward by enacting a law modernizing our electricity sector to enable it to make a rapid transition to renewable energy, and we now\n \nhave the enabling framework to trigger investments in transforming our economy so that it can harness the sun\u2019s power. We can now contemplate the possibility that, in the near future, people and consumers will pay less for electricity and the financial savings will be distributed to the areas where it is needed most, such as health and education. One day very soon, visitors  to our islands will be treated not only to a beautiful environment but also to a bold example of a more sustainable way of life.\nOf course, all of that work depends on the dedication of our partners and their commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 17. Our  ambitious goals can only be attained with strong international partnerships that respect our national priorities and independence. Palau is fortunate to have many good friends and strong partners. We continue to strengthen our relationship with the United States of America through the Compact of Free Association, and we offer our gratitude for our unique relationship. We wish to give special thanks to the United States of  America for the approval of the amended financial provisions  of our Compact. The Government of Japan has also provided generous support through the  years,  and we are sincerely grateful. Its friendship, assistance, partnership and support continue to strengthen our economic and social undertakings.\nWe would also like to express special thanks to India for its recent efforts to expand and strengthen  its partnership with my country. India has partnered with us to improve our youth initiatives and strengthen family projects, and this year  I  have  declared  2018 as a Year of Good Health, for which India is now a significant partner in reforming our health  sector.  We look forward to working through the Indo-Pacific strategy for partnerships in maintaining the integrity of our maritime areas. Cooperation in surveillance and the efforts of international law against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing will address a major challenge to sustainable fisheries, as well as improve regional security. The Government of Australia remains a strong partner in our maritime surveillance and enforcement efforts. We also recognize its support to the development of our information and communications technology sector through the World Bank.\nThe Republic of China, Taiwan has long been an ally in our efforts to achieve our Sustainable Development Goals. That special friendship and  partnership  can be seen in our infrastructure investments, as well as\ncontinued assistance in health and education. We urge the United Nations to seek a solution that will enable it to include Taiwan in all its processes, including the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization. My Government firmly believes that Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in the United Nations system will greatly benefit the work of the United Nations and its 2030 Agenda and beyond. Palau is fortunate to have gained many newer partners and friends, and I would like to recognize the European Union, Italy, Indonesia, New Zealand, Russia, Thailand, Spain, Singapore, Korea, South Africa, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Viet Nam and many others.\nWe remain committed to the need to ensure that nuclear weapons are never used again. There is an inextricable connection between testing and the elimination of nuclear weapons. The legacy of the more than 2,000 nuclear tests that have been conducted has touched people and communities in many regions, including the victims of nuclear testing in the Pacific. Nuclear tests have damaged the environment, human health, food security and economic development. Weapons of mass destruction have no place in this world, and we urge that efforts be  made to  achieve the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of such weapons and ballistic missiles of all ranges by North Korea. The global community must adhere to the fulfilment and implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions and should uphold the international rule of law.\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General for initiating reforms of the United Nations, including the repositioning of the United Nations development system. Given the special status of our small island States with regard to their vulnerability, remoteness and size, the reform under way is timely and also highlights the need for a strengthened role for United Nations country teams and the resident coordinator system, along with the establishment of permanent offices for them in our region. We must ensure that the smallest countries are able to fully participate in the development of reform plans. Palau also reiterates its call, as a member of the Pacific small island developing States, for the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General on climate and security, which would address a significant gap in the United Nations system.\nBuilding peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies is no longer an aspirational ideal. It is an\n \nabsolute necessity for addressing the very grave economic, environmental and humanitarian challenges facing the world. Palau stands with the Assembly as we begin the seventy-third session and as we continue working on that critical voyage.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for Brazil and it gives us great pleasure to officially open this general debate. I am pleased to greet the President of the General Assembly, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, the first Latin American woman to hold that high office at the United Nations. Allow me to reiterate, Madam, my wishes for your every success, and rest assured that you can count on Brazil.\nIt is also particularly satisfying to greet Secretary- General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in our common language.\nHow many speakers have already come to this rostrum to call for the improvement of the international order that we have been building for decades? There have certainly been many, myself included. I believe we were and still are right to do so, and the words we spoke remain relevant.\nHowever, if we truly  want to improve our international collective order, yet another task is required of us today: to defend the very integrity of that order. However imperfect it may be, the current order has nevertheless served  the  greater  interests  of humankind.\nThere are numerous challenges  to  the  integrity of the current international order. We live in times clouded by isolationist forces. Old intolerances are re-emerging. Unilateral relapses are increasingly becoming less the exception than the rule. Yet those challenges should not and cannot intimidate us. When it comes to isolationism, intolerance and unilateralism, we must respond to each of those tendencies with the very best that our peoples have.\nBrazil has been responding to the first of those tendencies \u2014 isolationism \u2014 with more  openness  and more integration. Brazil is keenly aware that our common development ultimately depends on more international trade and investment flows. It depends on increased contact with new ideas and with new technologies. We will build prosperity that can be effectively shared only by opening ourselves to others, rather than by withdrawing into introspection and isolation.\nThat is how Brazil has acted. We have implemented a universalist foreign policy. We have worked to deepen integration mechanisms in our geographic region. Within the South American Common Market, for example, we have reaffirmed the group\u2019s democratic calling, brought trade barriers down and entered into new agreements. We have been pushing for strengthened ties with the countries forming the Pacific Alliance so\n \nas to seek an increasingly united Latin America, as enshrined in our Constitution.\nWe have also revitalized and initiated trade negotiations with partners in all regions, such as the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, Canada, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia. Through these and other initiatives, we continue to strengthen our relationships with the Americas as a whole, as well as with Europe, Asia and Africa.\nBrazil\u2019s participation in  cooperation  forums, such as the G-20, the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and  the  Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, has  been especially productive. In those forums we have worked to produce tangible results that have a direct impact  on the daily life of our societies. It is with openness and integration that we approach a better future for  all. Isolation may provide a false sense of security. Protectionism may sound seductive. But it is with openness and integration that we achieve harmony, growth and progress.\nTurning to the challenge posed by intolerance, Brazil has responded decisively with dialogue and solidarity, which inspire us, at every moment, to honour the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The implementation of that document, created almost 70 years ago, is an imperative that requires permanent attention and action. Much has already been done for the sake of human rights by Governments, institutions and individuals. One such remarkable individual was S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, a  Brazilian national to whom I wish to pay tribute as we remember the fifteenth anniversary of his tragic death.\nWe must nonetheless acknowledge that violations of international norms protecting individuals and their dignity persist worldwide. In Latin America, Brazil has been working to uphold democracy and human rights. We will continue to do so with so many other countries in solidarity with brotherly peoples that have suffered so much.\nDialogue and solidarity also form the basis for the recently agreed global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. There are more than 250 million migrants in the world. These are men, women and children who, threatened by protracted crises, are faced with the hard and risky choice of leaving their homelands. It is our duty to protect them, and that is the very purpose of the global compact on migration. It now falls on us to conclude the negotiations on the global compact on refugees.\nIn South America, a large-scale  migratory wave is under way. It is estimated that more than 1 million Venezuelans have left their country in search of better living conditions. Brazil has welcomed all those who have arrived in our territory. We have sought to provide assistance of all types to tens of thousands of migrants. In cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, we have built shelters to protect them as best as we can. We have sought to relocate them throughout the country. We have issued documents that enable them to work in Brazil. We have offered schooling for the children, and vaccination and health services for all. But we know  that this crisis can be resolved only when our neighbour, Venezuela, rediscovers the path of development.\nBrazil has a proud tradition of welcoming foreigners. As a people, we have been forged through diversity. There is a piece of the world in every Brazilian. Faithful to that tradition, last year we passed a new migration law \u2014 a modern piece of legislation that not only protects the immigrant\u2019s dignity but also recognizes the benefits of immigration. We in Brazil have expanded rights and have streamlined the entry and residence process.\nDialogue and solidarity are antidotes to intolerance, and they are the foundation for a lasting peace. That has been the cornerstone of the Brazilian position regarding the various crises in the Middle East. As it joins the celebrations of the seventieth anniversary of the creation of Israel, Brazil renews its support for the two-State solution \u2014 Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security.\nWe also support international efforts to bring the conflict in Syria to a long overdue end. We have sought to help alleviate the great suffering there. In 2017 alone, for example, Brazil donated approximately one ton of medicines and vaccines for children affected by the conflict. We have also welcomed a considerable number of Syrian refugees.\nOn the Korean peninsula, dialogue and solidarity represent the cornerstone of our position. We reiterate our support for diplomatic solutions leading to denuclearization and peace.\n \nIt is through dialogue and solidarity that we will overcome intolerance and build peace. As expressed by Nelson Mandela, whose centenary we commemorate this year, it is our duty to strive towards \u201ca world of tolerance and respect for difference\u201d, and to show an unwavering \u201ccommitment to peaceful solutions of conflicts and disputes\u201d.\nLastly, the challenge of unilateralism must be met with more diplomacy and more multilateralism. We do so firmly convinced that collective problems demand coordinated solutions. That is noblest meaning of the United Nations \u2014 a house for mutual understanding.\nWe must strengthen the Organization. We must make it more legitimate and effective. We need important reforms \u2014 among them the reform of the Security Council, whose current configuration reflects a world that no longer exists. Finally, we  must reinvigorate  the values of diplomacy and multilateralism. We have shown time and again what we are capable of together when those values guide our actions, such as when we took a historic step last year in concluding the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. I had the honour of being the first Head of State to sign it.\nThat is also how, over the course of decades, we built a robust multilateral trade system with increasingly comprehensive rules and a credible and effective dispute-settlement mechanism. Those are shared historic achievements, which we must honour and broaden by eliminating the many distortions in agricultural trade, which primarily affect developing countries.\nDiplomacy and multilateralism provide us with effective solutions well beyond disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and international trade.  The  same is true in many other areas, such as sustainable development,   which   is   crucial   for    the    future of humankind.\nI note that in recent years alone, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement. Those are true milestones that put us on the path of economic development with social justice and respect for the environment. Brazil\u2019s early commitment to sustainable development remains unwavering. There is no shortage of examples.\nWe are fully committed to the shift towards a low-carbon international economy. Over 40  per cent of Brazil\u2019s energy portfolio is clean and renewable. It is one of the most sustainable in the world. We have also stepped up efforts to reduce deforestation. Long- term trends are encouraging. Today, in the Brazilian Amazon region, deforestation rates are 75 per cent lower than in 2004. Over the past two years, we have created and expanded environmental protection areas in Brazil, which are now more than four times the size of Norway.\nThe protection of the oceans is another cause that is dear to us. During the World Water Forum, which we hosted in Brasilia earlier this year, we established protected areas in Brazilian waters as vast as Germany and France combined. In two years, we have doubled the size of protected areas in Brazil.\nDiplomacy and multilateralism are also decisive instruments for global security, as demonstrated by United Nations peacekeeping missions, in which Brazil is proud to play a major role. And make no mistake, they are also decisive instruments for defeating terrorism and fighting transnational crime. Trafficking in persons, arms and drugs, money laundering, and sexual exploitation are crimes that know no borders. They are scourges that corrode our societies and can be effectively tackled only through concerted policies and actions.\nThat is what we have done in our region. In Brasilia, we hosted the first ministerial meeting of South American countries on border security. Since then, we have stepped up cooperation with our neighbours in combating transnational crime. We must remain united in the collective task of building a world where peace, development and human rights prevail. Absolutely nothing will be achieved alone. We will achieve nothing without diplomacy and multilateralism.\nThis is the last time that I will have the privilege of representing my country in the general debate at the General Assembly as the President of  the Republic. In two weeks, the Brazilian people will go to  the polls. They will choose their political leaders in both the executive and the legislative branches, who will govern Brazil starting in 2019, as enshrined in our Constitution. That is what has been done for almost 30 year, and that is how it must always be. After all, we are Government officials chosen by the people because all power comes from the people, and the President holds the power only for a  fixed period. The transfer of power is the very essence of democracy. Ours is a vibrant democracy anchored by solid institutions. As\n \nI turn over the presidency to my successor, I will have the peace of mind of having fulfilled my duties.\nToday, in Brazil, we can look back and realize how much we have accomplished in such a short term of office. We rejected populism, and we overcame the worst recession in our history, with severe consequences for society, especially for the poor. We managed public finances responsibly and restored our economic credibility. We are growing and creating jobs again. Social programmes once threatened by uncontrolled spending have been rescued and expanded. We put Brazil back on the path of development.\nThe country that I will hand over to whomever the Brazilian people elect will be better than the one   I received. Much remains to be done, but we are back on track. It is time to move ahead. The incoming Administration and National Congress will find a solid foundation upon which a more prosperous and just country can continue to be built.\nThe members of the General Assembly know that Brazil will always be a steady ally for cooperation among nations. In the face of isolationism, Brazil responds with more openness and integration. In the face of intolerance, it responds with increased dialogue and solidarity. And, in the face of unilateralism, it responds with more diplomacy and multilateralism.\nIn the words of the late Kofi Annan:\n\u201cOur mission is to confront ignorance with knowledge, bigotry with tolerance, and isolation with the outstretched hand of generosity\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "As His Excellency President Faiez Serraj is unable to attend the general debate at this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly due to the latest developments in Tripoli, he has asked me to deliver the following statement on his behalf:\n\u201cAt the outset, allow me, Sir, to congratulate, through you, Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I would like to wish her every success and assure her of our full cooperation as she works to realize the goals of this session. I also thank her predecessor Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for the efforts he  made  as  President  of the General Assembly during the seventy-second session. In addition, I would like to commend Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for the efforts he has made to fulfil the purposes and objectives of the United Nations.\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the situation of my country, Libya, continues to draw the attention of the United Nations and the international community as a whole and still requires monitoring. We appreciate and respect all those who have made sincere efforts to help us overcome the difficult circumstances in which we find ourself and the challenges we are facing. We underscore the need to coordinate and integrate these efforts and to avoid rivalries or divergences when initiatives are launched, because failure to do so diminishes our capacity to respond to the crisis. We believe that, before holding any regional or international meeting on the Libyan issue, it is important that there be coordination with the United Nations so as to ensure that the outcome is compatible with the United Nations vision for the resolution of the Libyan crisis.\n\u201cSince its establishment, the Presidency Council of the Government of National Accord of Libya has recognized the scope of the challenges that the country is facing, namely, the upsurge in terrorism, political divergences, security instability and an exacerbated economic crisis, all of which has had an impact on the delivery of the necessary basic services and therefore on the lives of Libyans themselves. We remain committed to finding expeditious solutions to these challenges. Last year, we proposed a road map for overcoming the crisis based on holding presidential and parliamentary elections, putting an end to all fighting except the fight against terrorism, and providing the necessary conditions for national reconciliation. In our view, this approach would unify national institutions\n \nand allow us to create a modern  democratic  State. However, even though the relevant national institutions have not shown any reciprocity, we nevertheless remain hopeful, reaching out to all with determination and  sincere  initiatives,  with a view to breaking the political deadlock that has brought such frustration to the people of Libya and the State alike.\n\u201cWe highly commend the ongoing efforts of Mr. Ghassan Salam\u00e9, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya, and his team, aimed at bringing together the points of view of the Libyan parties and seeking solutions to the wide range of issues and challenges we are facing. In this regard, I would recall that the Government of National Accord welcomed the road map proposed by Mr. Salam\u00e9 at the high-level meeting on Libya in September 2017. The Government encouraged all relevant parties to show flexibility so that consensus on amendments related to certain controversial items in the Political Agreement could be quickly reached, thereby creating momentum towards implementing the remaining steps of the plan. Unfortunately, no progress has been made.\n\u201cThe Presidency Council of the Government of  National Accord supports any path leading to a comprehensive political solution, which is why we have engaged in dialogue with those calling for general elections as a way out of the political crisis. We have facilitated the High National Electoral Commission\u2019s efforts to register voters, and the results have been very encouraging. The number of voters registered has been unprecedented, surpassing our expectations and reflecting the desire of Libyans to have elections held. We have also allocated 60 million Libyan dinars to the Commission in order to prepare for the elections. We have worked with the relevant parties to ensure the security conditions needed for elections to be held in complete freedom and integrity. We hope that this expression of the will of the people will be acted upon by the relevant institutions, which must commit to seeing that the country\u2019s interests prevail, to making all necessary legislative and legal arrangements to end the political stalemate and to bringing all State institutions together to resolve the various problems being faced by the Libyan people.\n\u201cWe underscore our determination to continue making efforts to get the country out of its crises. We will strongly oppose all who attempt to impose their will through the use of weapons. We have condemned the military attacks that took place in the suburbs of Tripoli city a few weeks ago, which led to gross material damage and loss of human lives, terrorizing women and children and forcibly displacing innocent civilians. .\n\u201cWe highly appreciate the efforts of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), under the leadership of Mr. Ghassan Salam\u00e9, to bring about a ceasefire agreement, and we  call  on all relevant parties to respect that ceasefire. I give my word that the national and international judicial bodies will be seized with the prosecution of the perpetrators of attacks for the  suffering they caused.\n\u201cWe are also determined to take the security measures needed to unify the country\u2019s military and security institutions and establish security  and peace in Libya, as stipulated by the Political Agreement. We wish to underline once again that the use or threat of use of weapons only benefits terrorists who, amid the chaos, find opportunities to carry out their criminal acts. We saw this in the terrorist attacks in Tripoli that targeted the High National Electoral Commission and the national oil company. Accordingly, priority must be given to security and stability as an indispensable goal and urgent step that also requires active support from the United Nations. We therefore believe that it is important to convert UNSMIL from a special political mission to a  mission  whose  purpose is to establish and support security and stability throughout the country.\n\u201cThe Government of National Accord is striving to find solutions to the difficult living conditions and lack of services that Libyans are facing.  It  has launched economic reforms to facilitate and improve the living conditions of our citizens and to enhance the performance of a hitherto unstable service sector. In this regard, we attach particular importance to mobilizing financial resources to respond to the needs of  our people. We  call on  all States holding Libyan assets or funds to make the necessary arrangements for the Presidency Council to be able to cover the costs of policies and programmes designed to help all Libyans.\n \n\u201cMy country reiterates its absolute condemnation and rejection of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, regardless of its origin, perpetrators or motives. We underscore that terrorism is a global phenomenon that should not be linked to any religion or doctrine. As the Assembly is aware, my country has made enormous sacrifices to eradicate terrorist organizations with foreign fighters in their ranks, including Da\u2019esh, which was exported to us from abroad. Not only does Da\u2019esh threaten the security and stability of Libya, but it also exploits our natural resources for its own benefit as it carries out its bloodthirsty agenda \u2014 one, I would add, that has no link to Islam. Libya has ratified all international conventions related to the fight against terrorism and considers the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its four pillars one of the most important international legal frameworks to guide national legislation in fighting the phenomenon of terrorism.\n\u201cThe dangers posed by terrorist networks remain in Libya, requiring us to be vigilant and   to strengthen joint coordination at all levels as well as regional and international cooperation so that terrorists can be tracked down and eliminated wherever they are. It is also important that regional and subregional plans and programmes, including, for example, the outcomes of ministerial meetings on bolstering cooperation in the field of security and joint monitoring of borders, continue to receive support. The most recent meeting on this topic was held in the Sudanese capital, with the participation of the Sudan, the Niger, Chad and Libya, resulting in a joint action plan to implement the agreement that had been previously concluded in N\u2019Djamena by those four States. We hope that this action plan will receive support from the international community. We have expressed our support for all international efforts aimed at fighting terrorism and underscored on many occasions our support for calls for holding an international high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations on ways to unify efforts in that regard.\n\u201cWith respect to human rights, we emphasize our determination to uphold  and  protect  them. As proof of our commitment in that domain, we have adopted several laws, including those on establishing political parties, legalizing peaceful demonstrations, criminalizing torture and enforced\ndisappearances, amending the penal code and codifying transitional justice. This legislation, which will soon enter into force, is designed to promote tolerance and harmony among members of our national community.\n\u201cWith regard to economic, social and cultural rights, the Government of National Accord has continually sought to promote women\u2019s  rights  and gender equality, while providing free and ongoing educational  services   and   medical  care to all citizens. Pursuant to article 7 of the Constitutional Declaration, which calls for joining all international and regional conventions and charters related to strengthening human rights, we have ratified some of those conventions, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which Libya is now a party.\n\u201cWe once again wish to reiterate our commitment to protecting and upholding human rights. However, we note that current difficulties in the transitional period have given rise to certain security challenges that have led  to human rights violations. In this regard, we look forward to benefiting from technical assistance mechanisms from the Human Rights Council and other programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations.\n\u201cMy country pays great attention to the issue of illegal migration. We seek to address the ongoing flow of migrants being exploited by human trafficking networks, thousands of whom have perished at sea. This kind of migration is causing human suffering that the international community has been unable to address until now. Libya is a transit country that is facing serious economic, social and security consequences as a  result of  the migration phenomenon; indeed, the migration issue has clearly exacerbated the state of insecurity in Libya, causing many difficulties and problems across Libyan society. It is difficult to limit the repercussions of the phenomenon without foreign cooperation and assistance commensurate with the scope of these challenges and their consequences. Clearly, the optimal solution does not lie in dealing with it merely as a problem of security. We  need to focus on the real underlying causes that push people to seek the daunting path of migration.\n \n\u201cAccordingly, we welcome the efforts undertaken to reach an international agreement for safe, orderly and regular migration, to be adopted at the intergovernmental conference to be held in Marrakech, Kingdom of Morocco, in December. Nevertheless, we would have liked to  see  the draft agreement deal with this issue in a broader manner. We agree on the need to protect the rights of migrants as much as possible. However, the current and increasing flow of migrants excessively burdens national potentials and capabilities to such an extent that migrants\u2019 rights can rarely be guaranteed.\n\u201cI firmly believe that the international community should support countries of origin and encourage them to develop and implement effective development programmes and projects, thereby enhancing their productive and services sectors, so that poverty, unemployment and other forms of deprivation fall away and people can stop thinking of irregular and dangerous emigration as a solution.\n\u201cMy country pays great attention to issues of disarmament and the maintenance of international peace and security. It actively participates in the deliberations in various forums on those issues and actively supports many decisions taken by the United Nations in the field. We fully endorse the relevant international treaties and conventions, cognizant of the fact that producing and stockpiling weapons of mass destruction is a threat to international peace and security, which horrifies all members of the human race.\n\u201cMoreover, Libya has participated in international disarmament efforts related to weapons of mass destruction and the maintenance of international peace and security. In this regard, I would like to recall that after joining the Chemical Weapons Convention, my country promptly addressed its chemical stock, in cooperation and coordination with the secretariat of the Convention and its international partners, which eventually led us to destroying our chemical stocks.\n\u201cWe reaffirm our support for international efforts aimed at establishing nuclear-weapon free zones. We stress that the Middle East region as a whole should be free of weapons of mass destruction and that all countries in the region should declare that they possess such weapons or have the intention\nto do so. All countries in the region must also join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n\u201cAt the same time, we would like to underscore the right of States to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. States that have abandoned weapons of mass destruction should be supported and encouraged to train people in the area of the peaceful use of nuclear energy so that they might acquire the necessary technical knowledge to pursue such uses.\n\u201cThree years have elapsed since the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is focused on 17 ambitious goals, was  adopted by  the Heads of State and Government. We in Libya are facing many challenges  in  the  achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), mostly due to political and security instability. The Assembly is aware that development is closely linked to security; indeed, as is  well  known, there is no development without security and no security without development. We look  forward to moving past these difficulties and to launching development plans and programmes to improve our economy and start focusing on attaining the SDGs.\n\u201cThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for  Development  stress  the  need  of  countries to mobilize financial resources to achieve their development goals. My country, Libya, is one of the countries whose funds have been transferred abroad. We therefore call on States holding our funds to disclose that fact and help us recover them so that we can begin to implement the Sustainable Development Goals in a serious manner.\n\u201cAccordingly, we would like to recall the frozen Libyan funds and assets of the Libyan sovereign wealth fund, which is incurring losses as a result of the sanctions imposed by the many Security Council resolutions adopted since 2011. We underscore that the purpose of those sanctions was to preserve Libyan funds and assets, rather than deplete them. However, the assets freeze has caused those funds and assets to incur enormous ongoing losses. Since March 2016, we have provided the Security Council and the relevant sanctions committee with clear information about our losses, and have appealed to them to amend the current sanctions regime so that we can put a stop\n \nto these huge losses. Unfortunately, we have not seen any action taken in response to our justified requests. If nothing changes, the wasting of frozen Libyan resources would in essence deprive Libyans of funds that could be invested in their future.\n\u201cMy delegation supports the Secretary- General\u2019s proposed reforms of certain United Nations bodies, and we hope that these reforms lead us to  fulfilling the  commitments  set  forth in the 2005 World Summit Outcome, namely, to consolidate the authority of the Organization and ensure its effectiveness and ability to properly address all current challenges. Despite the progress that has been made elsewhere, the Security Council, the most important organ in the Organization, has yet to implement any reform. It is therefore crucial that the Security Council, which no longer reflects the realities of the world of the twenty-first century, undertake genuine reform.\n\u201cIn the face of the serious challenges threatening international peace and security, the current geopolitical situation calls for a reform process that results in equitable representation in the Council. We call for an end to the historical injustice suffered by the African continent with regard to its unfair representation in the permanent and non-permanent categories of Security Council membership. We underline the African demand contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, namely, two permanent seats with all rights and powers, including the right to veto, and two non-permanent seats. This demand is in line with the requirements of justice and the right of the African continent to effectively participate in the decisions made by the Council, particularly in the light of the fact that many such decisions are on African issues. The African demand reflects the right of the continent to a minimum of fair representation in the Council and offsets the marginalization and historical injustice that Africa has suffered. Accordingly, we also support the demand by the Group of Arab States to be granted a permanent seat on the Council.\n\u201cPeace in the Middle East will not be achieved as long as the occupying Power continues to shed the blood of innocent Palestinians, confiscate their land, build settlements, impose an unjust siege on the Palestinian people, seek by any  means to Judaize Jerusalem, and flout all relevant\ninternational resolutions. We join the Palestinian people in rejecting the announcement by the occupying Power that Israel is a Jewish nation State. This announcement risks triggering dangerous escalation and improperly resolving the Palestinian question by removing native Palestinians from their ancestral lands and allowing them to be replaced by Jewish settlers. Such practices have been soundly rejected as racist.\n\u201cFurthermore, we reject attempts to change the legal status of occupied Jerusalem, including attempts by certain States to use a policy of fait accompli, for example by transferring their embassies in Israel to the city of Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel. These attempts violate relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.\n\u201cWe underscore our support for the Palestinian people and their right to  self-determination and  to the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. We call for the protection of the Palestinian people and demand that the occupying Power cease all acts of violence, terrorism, settlements and repeated attacks  against them.\n\u201cNot far from occupied Palestine, in some regions of Syria, the brotherly Syrian people have been facing disastrous humanitarian situations for years as a result of a destructive conflict that has caused immense human and material damage and led to the displacement of many innocent people. We condemn all brutal terrorist acts committed against the Syrian people and support all international efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution that would avoid dismantling and partitioning the country. We also support international efforts aimed at fulfilling the aspirations of the Syrian people to live a decent life in a democratic country governed by the rule of law, where human rights are maintained and respected.\n\u201cWith regard to our  brotherly country Yemen, we express deep concern at the disastrous humanitarian situation unfolding there. We have spoken out against the continuing conflict that is clearly threatening the security, stability and unity of Yemeni society, as well as the security of the region as a whole. In this context, we support all efforts aimed at stopping the bloodshed in Yemen\n \nand at alleviating the suffering of the brotherly Yemeni people.\n\u201cIn conclusion, I would like to stress that today\u2019s challenges, whether they be security, economic, social or other types of  challenge,  require  that we all work together to strengthen the role of the United Nations so that it can adapt to developments in the international arena and resolve conflicts and crises through peaceful means.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "The European Union is fighting intensely to preserve the rules-based\n \ninternational order, which is currently under great strain with regard to trade, security, climate change and human rights. We say that not only as countries that strongly support the United Nations, but as a continent that cares deeply about respect, mutual understanding and solidarity among nations.\nAs leaders, we must equip the United Nations with the means to successfully fulfil its mandate. More unity and collective actions are needed in the struggle against conflict, poverty and famine, terrorism and the mass displacement of people, as evident in Venezuela, Syria, Myanmar and many other places. To that end, the European Union firmly supports the current effort to reform the United Nations. Those reforms are much needed and overdue. Their urgency is clear, and their implementation is essential.\nThe European Union is taking on more responsibility for security matters. We have initiated ambitious cooperation among our countries\u2019 militaries. We are ready to step up our help to our neighbours through crisis-management missions, capacity-building and peacekeeping in cooperation with others, including NATO, the African Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The European Union also supports the Action for Peacekeeping initiative and expects it to produce more effective and better resourced global security solutions.\nEurope has taken action against the increased use of disinformation and outside propaganda to interfere in open  and democratic  elections.  The  anonymity of cyberspace is used by external actors to cloak malicious political interference. It is not just a problem for Europe; many others here today have been similarly affected. The United Nations should help expose that phenomenon, attribute responsibility and increase democratic resilience.\nOne hundred years after the birth of Nelson Mandela, we commemorate his triumph over apartheid in South Africa. I am very pleased that the occasion coincides with deeper ties between the African Union and the European Union. The summit of our two Unions in Abidjan last November was key. Thanks to excellent cooperation between the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations, we have so far helped more than 30,000 people leave Libya through voluntary humanitarian returns. We want to expand the work with our partners in other areas. Education, investment\nin development, climate change and free trade will therefore be at the heart of our future relations.\nAfrica is a continent of great challenges, but also one of equally great opportunities. Instability in Libya has brought the world\u2019s attention to the suffering caused by human smugglers and traffickers who take brutal advantage of people and weaken the States in which they operate. The Security Council named some of the worst violators in June. They and those like them should be sanctioned, apprehended and brought to justice. In the meantime, the European Union will work diligently and in good faith with our North African partners on search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean. Only collective responsibility can offer effective solutions to global problems such as migration and forced displacement. I truly hope that the recent United Nations debates on the future management of migration and refugee protection represent a step in the right direction.\nThe European Union leads global resettlement efforts, including resettlements from Turkey, which, along with Jordan and Lebanon, is hosting refugees who have been displaced by the fighting in Syria. The Syrian people are suffering as the war continues. The memorandum of understanding on Idlib must be fully implemented in order to help to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. All parties must respect international humanitarian law, ensure the protection of civilians and allow aid to reach those in need. A meaningful political process under the auspices of the United Nations is especially needed in order to resolve the conflict.\nSustainable development  and increasing intercontinental connectivity will bring countries, people and societies closer together. Those priorities will be crucial in our future relations with Africa and also at next month\u2019s Asia-Europe Meeting, which I will be hosting in Brussels. They go hand in hand with the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and other international commitments. From floods to fires, the impact of climate change becomes more visible every year, and sadly, we now measure the impact by the loss of human life. Although only slow progress is being made on our main task, which is implementing the Paris Agreement, the European Union remains fully committed to it and has set it as a priority in its relations with our partners.\nOn the subject of the environment, I  would like  to take this opportunity to appeal to all leaders to  take action in order to protect the waters around the\n \nAntarctic. There is still time to save the natural habitat of many endangered species by establishing maritime sanctuaries in the Southern Ocean. Let me say it loud and clear. Those who can imagine our planet without whales, penguins and other species will also have to imagine our planet without humans.\nNon-proliferation is another global challenge we face, but there the situation is looking better, thanks to multilateral action on sanctions. A year ago, the situation on the Korean peninsula was critical. Although much depends on the attitude of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, we have seen that diplomacy can open the way to more comprehensive solutions. A similar situation exists with Iran with regard to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. While addressing nuclear issues, that deal has also helped to create space for dialogue on other matters of concern, such as Iran\u2019s regional behaviour and ballistic-missile programmes. The agreement is good for European, regional and global security. That is why the European Union is committed to maintaining it as long as Iran remains fully committed to it.\nI have mentioned the anniversary of Nelson Mandela\u2019s 100th birthday.  In  the  next  few  hours,  we will also celebrate the seventy-fifth birthday of another Nobel Peace Prize winner, a great Pole named Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa. Both men are symbols of a beautiful cause \u2014 how to win without violence, forgive our oppressors and overcome evil with good  in  public life. Today, when so many people \u2014 including some here in this Hall, and even the most powerful  of  world leaders \u2014 are starting to give up on freedom, solidarity and democracy, let us remember Mandela\u2019s and Wa\u0142\u0119sa\u2019s message. Regardless of how difficult their situation was, they never capitulated in their fight.\n"

I can assure her of my delegation\u2019s fullest support and cooperation in the effective discharge of her responsibilities. Let me also convey my sincere appreciation to her predecessor for his able leadership of the Assembly over the past year.\nThis year, the United Nations lost one of  its icons, someone who rose through the  ranks to  lead the Organization and who, as the Secretary-General rightly said, truly represented what the United Nations is all about. We mourn the loss of this illustrious son of Africa, who left an enduring mark on the world stage, Mr. Kofi Annan.\nWe are meeting at a time when multilateralism is facing serious challenges, and yet there has never been a time when we needed multilateralism more. That is why this gathering of nations under the umbrella of the United Nations is so important. It remains the only universal Organization whose very ideals of freedom, equality and justice are still as valid today as they were at its inception. As the late Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia stated in his address to the General Assembly in October 1963:\n\u201cThe Charter of the United Nations expresses the noblest aspirations of man: the abjuration of force in the settlement of disputes between States; the assurance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion; the safeguarding of international peace and security.\u201d (A/PV.1229, para. 5)\nThat remains profoundly true. Let me take this opportunity today to assure the Assembly that Ethiopia, as a founding Member of the United Nations, will continue to adhere to those ideals and to the principles of multilateralism as we face unprecedented challenges and threats to our community of nations.\nEthiopia\u2019s contribution to United Nations peacekeeping is second to none. We remain totally committed to that noble  endeavour  as  we  reform  and adapt to the new and challenging realities of peacekeeping. We fully endorse the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative and the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations to tackle the challenges peacekeeping faces today.\nSix months ago, a peaceful  transfer  of  power took place in Ethiopia. It opened a new chapter in our country\u2019s political and social history, offering realistic and genuine possibilities for change that will meet the hopes and expectations of our youthful population. Those changes are in line with the new political and democratic realities that we are implementing and have been welcomed and embraced by Ethiopians across  the length and breadth of the country. Creating a just, peaceful, equitable and sustainable society is the vision that we are supporting as we build a new society on the foundations and achievements of the past. I believe that vision is highly appropriate and relevant to our discussion here at this session of the General Assembly and to the theme selected for this general debate.\nEthiopia and its people have frequently shown their resilience and strength in times of adversity. We are quite confident that we will continue to do so. No difficulties are insurmountable. Of course, there are challenges that we continue to encounter in working to ensure that the benefits of economic growth and development are widely shared among all of our people. We are working today to broaden and deepen the necessary reforms in order to promote democratic governance and the rule of law, promote fairness and justice and better financial and economic  management,  ensure  transparency and accountability in our governance, and foster participation in an effective democracy.\nIn the last six months, we have made every effort to ensure all of that, which, together with our message of forgiveness and reconciliation, strengthens the unity and solidarity of our people. The new Government,  led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, is taking a series of measures \u2014 opening up the democratic space in every direction, opening up the economy and tackling obstacles to development, such as corruption, human rights violations, and failures of administration and governance. In other words, we continue to respond to the hopes and aspirations of our people. Those reforms have been welcomed across the country and beyond.\nWe have not confined our efforts to Ethiopia. There is another key historic development in our region. In the last three months, my Prime Minister has embarked upon a significant reconciliation initiative across the\n \nHorn of Africa. It is the start of a genuine normalization among the countries of the Horn. Ethiopia and Eritrea have opened a new chapter in their relationship, ending two decades of conflict. We are normalizing relations and charting a future in which our relationship will truly reflect the long-standing ties between our peoples. Somalia and Eritrea have reconciled their differences and have re-established diplomatic relations.\nEarly this month, we held a trilateral summit involving Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia in Asmara. We Foreign Ministers then visited Djibouti, opening a new phase in relations between Djibouti and Eritrea. The Chairperson of the African Union Commission has rightly called that effort a clear demonstration of the value and effectiveness of the search for African solutions to African problems.\nRecently, my Prime Minister and the President of Eritrea signed the Agreement on Peace, Friendship and Comprehensive Cooperation in Jeddah. The Presidents of Eritrea and Djibouti shook hands in Jeddah, thus ending a decade of dispute. In the light of those important and positive developments, it is appropriate and timely that the Security Council now, without delay, seriously consider lifting the sanctions imposed on Eritrea. A few days ago, the South Sudanese parties signed the revitalized Agreement on the  Resolution  of the Conflict in the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  at an Extraordinary Summit of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development Assembly of Heads of State and Government in Addis Ababa. The Agreement offers a real prospect for peace in South Sudan after five years of civil war.\nThose are indeed major developments in the Horn of Africa. As the Secretary-General put it, a \u201cpowerful wind of hope is blowing across the Horn of Africa.\u201d It is a wind that offers a start to the process of unravelling the years of conflict and suspicion across a region that has been one of the most conflict-ridden in Africa. The Horn of Africa is indeed becoming the hope of Africa.\nWhile all those major steps  towards  silencing the guns in our region are taking place, it is equally important to extend the process to promote a framework for regional economic integration to fight poverty. Moreover, regional  economic cooperation will make  a real contribution to help do away with violence and war, as well as promote deeper regional and continental integration in line with the African Union Agenda 2063.\nIn the light of the challenges that we face together as a region, the choice we have is very clear \u2014 we must work together for the collective destiny of our people. The historical, cultural, social and linguistic links  that bind our peoples form a proper basis for striving for common prosperity. We believe that regional integration, which benefits all countries of the Horn,  is our only viable option for meaningful development. We are already seeing dividends through regional integration projects. We are now working to accelerate such efforts, building on what we have already achieved.\nFinally, let me underline that Ethiopia will always remain firmly committed to making every possible effort to forge peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies in our subregion and our continent, Africa. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, we have been doing everything we can to support that important and noble cause, and we will continue to do so in the spirit of and with a commitment to nurturing peace, security and stability for the common good of our countries.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate Ambassador Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly and to wish her every possible success. It is a great honour for me to be able to once again address the Assembly as President of the Dominican Republic. This is a special occasion for our country, because next year the Dominican Republic will sit on the Security Council as a non-permanent member for the first time.\nOn behalf of  the Dominican people and myself,    I would therefore like to start by thanking the States Members of the United Nations for the support we have received in joining the Security Council. In particular, I thank the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States for the trust placed in us. Our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin America and the Caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace.\nOf course, we are committed to asserting, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. Respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the Security Council. We will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day.\nIt is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist. In that context, our country will always be a place of dialogue\n \nand understanding, and will always seek peaceful solutions. We are always willing to do whatever it takes to find common ground and support consensus as the best tool for peace and development. We will therefore always promote rapprochement among peoples through mediation and democratic dialogue, opening spaces for a future of shared peace.\nSince its founding more than seven decades ago, the United Nations has played a central role in creating a more stable and secure world for human beings across the globe. However, we can never consider stability a definitive achievement. We cannot lower our guard when we know, for example, that in our Latin American and Caribbean region alone, 35 per cent of the population belongs to the so-called vulnerable class and could therefore fall back into poverty when faced with any setback.\nBy the same token, it is fair to recognize that like so many other things, security is not well distributed. We all know that there are territories in the Americas and in many other places around the world where the prospect of living peacefully and without fear is an almost utopian vision, due to the control that organized crime exercises in those territories.\nWhat can we do, then, to make this a more stable world? What measures can we implement to ensure that security is not solely the asset of a select few countries, but one that extends throughout the world and reaches every neighbourhood and village? Of  course,  I  am not the only one asking those questions \u2014 everyone here has asked them at some point \u2014 nor will I give definitive answers, which can be formulated and found only by working together. What I will do is briefly mention what I consider two of the main threats to global stability and security. I am referring to climate change and drug trafficking and organized crime.\nAt first glance, they may seem very different from each other, but their complexity and global scope makes them two of the main challenges  facing humankind. In both cases, the consequences are the destruction of thousands of families, collateral damage to all aspects of human development and the overwhelming of States by the magnitude of the challenges they face.\nLet us start by talking about the consequences of natural disasters, which are occurring more and more frequently. We only have to open the newspaper or turn on the television to see the effects of climate change wreaking havoc somewhere on the planet. From the\ntyphoon that recently hit the Philippines, the strongest in decades, to the hurricane seasons that punish the Caribbean islands with increasing ferocity, no corner of the world is safe. Last year we saw Hurricane Irma leave Havana totally flooded, and it took many weeks for things to return to normal. Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, Antigua and Barbuda and other Caribbean islands, it has taken months to recover from the effects of Hurricane Maria, which not only brought about economic losses but also claimed a considerable number of human lives.\nIn the Dominican Republic, we are strongly committed to dealing with the consequences of climate change. That means that we are working simultaneously on three levels of action, local, national and international. It is at the local level where people\u2019s daily lives develop.  It  is  there  that  tragedies  take on a painful reality and where the work of building, preparing and raising awareness must begin.\nIt is at the local and national levels where our Government has a greater capacity to act and where we are improving resilience and relocating the communities that live around our most significant watersheds, which are highly vulnerable to meteorological events.  We are also doing a great deal of public awareness work and training thousands of  teachers  and  technicians to promote sustainable development in their schools and communities.\nThen there is the national level, where  we  are also working tirelessly, both on our rapid-response strategies and in the field of prevention. For instance, we are planting millions of trees across our country and investing more than ever before in renewable energy. Those measures will not only support our economy, they will enable us to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases by 25 per cent by 2030, a goal that we are very pleased about.\nHowever, the fight against climate change is  a task for all of us, and that is why the next level \u2014 the international level \u2014 is the broadest and most essential of the three. If there is no political will in this area, most of our efforts will come to nothing and will have a negative impact on all the progress we  have  made  at the local and national levels. That is why I would like to reiterate once again before the Assembly the importance of going beyond good intentions and focusing on concrete actions.\nAmong those actions, I want to once again highlight the urgency of financing and making operational\n \ninitiatives such as the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts, which will make it possible to compensate for the destruction of infrastructure and ecosystems and alleviate the threatening conditions of our residents. That fund is essential to ensuring that natural disasters do not destroy in a few hours what many nations have spent decades building.\nI will give one example, on  the  understanding that our case is not the most tragic in the Caribbean region. Last year, the storms Olga and Maria spelled the destruction of more than $1 billion worth of infrastructure. Imagine what that means for a country whose annual State budget is already limited. Above all, the Warsaw fund will help protect the valuable lives of millions of human beings, bringing them peace of mind for their homes and granting them a future without a constant uncertain feeling of threat every time they see that rain is coming. We therefore consider it indisputable that those countries that have most heavily contributed to the gas emissions that are responsible for climate change are also those that should contribute proportionally to the  fund  established  to  mitigate its effects.\nAs I described earlier, we also consider drug trafficking and organized crime to be a threat to global security and stability of a similar magnitude to that of climate change. The trafficking of illicit substances claims  thousands  of  lives  every  year,  particularly of young people,  who  are  extremely  valuable  to our countries. As if that were not bad enough, drug trafficking also permeates our institutions, unbalances our economies, threatens our values and brings nothing but degradation and destruction to our social fabric. Wherever organized crime prevails, the security and peace of our peoples always deteriorate over time. As with climate change, therefore, the fight against drugs must be conducted at all three levels \u2014 local, national and international \u2014 in order to achieve effective results.\nIn the case of our country, local intervention is focused on prevention campaigns and educating our young people by supporting them with training and entrepreneurial opportunities, while also improving the neighbourhoods where they live and recovering public spaces for people to use. We do all of that with the aim of saving the most vulnerable populations from criminal networks.\nAt the national level, our security forces and national drug control directorate are  working  all over the country as part of a comprehensive plan to strengthen our actions against drug trafficking. Among other initiatives, we are acquiring new, high-tech equipment and strengthening security at our ports and airports with more agents and security checks, as well as carrying out in-depth interventions in areas with the highest incidence of crime. In parallel, we have moved forward with the enactment of a law against money- laundering and the financing of terrorism, based on the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, with an emphasis on preventing and combating money- laundering, which drug traffickers use to ensure the profitability of their activities.\nFinally, at the international level, we have bilateral and multilateral agreements in place with the United States, the European Union and the countries of the Central American Integration System, as well as participating in the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, all with the objective of coordinating efforts and improving our efficiency in combating drug trafficking and organized crime. Thanks to such initiatives, we are better prepared to fight together against that evil, which threatens the integrity of our economies and our democracies. However, we must emphasize the need for greater international coordination.\nWe can make great strides forward if we join our efforts, share information and support each other in our work. We also understand that showing greater commitment is the responsibility of countries that due to their domestic demand for narcotics, have set in motion the international machinery of drug trafficking and organized crime. We  cannot ignore the fact that  it is the developing States that act as the first barrier in containing drug trafficking, thereby protecting the most developed countries.\nOur countries allocate billions of dollars each year to fulfilling that role, but it is never enough in the face of the huge resources deployed by organized crime networks. That is undoubtedly a key factor in the social disintegration that many of our countries are dealing with. As in the case of climate change, it is the more developed countries with greater consumption capacity that must dedicate more resources, cooperation and political will if they truly wish to fight the problem with any hope of victory.\n \nIn combating the effects of drug trafficking and climate change, we will address some of the structural causes of deeper poverty and social inequality. If the United Nations and the developed countries want to help fight poverty more comprehensively and openly, those two fronts are an intelligent, humane and cost- effective way to do so. We once again appeal to those countries from this rostrum to show the responsibility and solidarity we need to make our planet a safer place.\nClimate change, drug trafficking, poverty, social inequality and mass migration are all interrelated problems that we must deal with urgently. As we have pointed out today, the best and perhaps only way to do that is to act at all levels of response to the problem, so that the agreements we sign in a forum like the United Nations have a real impact on the lives of the people, and so that the needs of our peoples are articulated in their national and international institutions.\nWe must therefore all continue to act according to our capacities, without hesitation and with the same objective of creating a world that is increasingly stable, secure and developed, a world in which all men and women can carry forward their life dreams. That is the ultimate goal that the Dominican Republic will continue to work for. We will do it in our towns, neighbourhoods and all of our cities; with our immediate neighbours and with all members of the General Assembly; and in the Security Council next year, in the new role that we will be honoured to assume.\n"

        "file_text": "Despite all our efforts, 100 years after the end of the First World War we find ourselves in a world in which lasting peace  has not yet been universally secured and people are still dying in violent conflicts. The raison d\u2019\u00eatre  of  the United Nations is the protection of peace, human rights, justice and social progress. Those values are not a Western instrument. They form universal ideals that all of us, the States Members of the United Nations, should strive for together.\nWe face many challenges in areas such as the dignity of individuals, global prosperity, and sustainable development, including gender inequality, youth unemployment, global health threats, climate change, violent extremism, terrorism, forced displacement and uncontrolled migration. Furthermore, multilateralism and the rules-based system, which benefit everyone and have long held many of those threats at bay, are increasingly being undermined and questioned. One way that we as policymakers can tackle those challenges is by working to realize the difficult structural and political reforms of the United Nations so as to promote\n \nshared\tglobal\tresponsibility,\trobust\tinternational cooperation and the restoration of common values.\nWe all understand the importance of reforming  the Security Council in order to reflect the  realities  of today\u2019s world. In recent years, unfortunately, the Council has been characterized by blocking tactics rather than cooperation. Its failure to act on the world\u2019s worst atrocities is clearly visible in several brutal ongoing conflicts, from Syria to Yemen. The Secretary- General has already embarked on the challenging endeavour of reforming the United Nations, and the Czech Republic fully supports his efforts. Making the Organization more effective through much-needed reforms in the areas of peace and security, management and the development system will make the United Nations truly relevant to all people and help promote a peaceful, equitable and sustainable world. Accordingly, we should endorse the Secretary-General\u2019s work and give his proposals, including their budgetary and financial implications, the strongest possible support.\nThe vital point of the Secretary-General\u2019s reform agenda is its focus on the prevention of conflicts. All of us should work tirelessly work to ensure that crises are contained before they break out and that post-conflict countries are stabilized for the long term. For effective conflict prevention, we should adopt a comprehensive approach to peace and security that treats climate change as a security problem while also advancing sustainable development and promoting human rights.\nThe Czech Republic took great pride in  having the honour of holding the presidency of the Economic and Social Council during its 2017 session. I would like to thank everyone, Member States as well as the Secretariat, for their excellent cooperation. It was an enlightening experience, not just for our presidency team but for our entire Administration.\nIn the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are the foundation of our concerted efforts to promote sustainable development, the Czech Republic will continue to champion Sustainable Development Goal 16, not  only  as  a  follow-up  to our presidency of the Economic and Social Council but mainly as a cornerstone of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We consider peace, justice and functioning institutions our priority and a solid base on which a sustainable future for everyone can  be built. In the context of  sustainable development,    it is also crucial for the United Nations to seek more\nsynergies among its humanitarian, development and security activities.\nApart from conflict prevention,  there  should  be a special focus on post-conflict stabilization. Those efforts should be visible in the field. To achieve that, more cooperation among the United Nations specialized agencies is required, as well as broader coordination with and between the Member States.\nHistory teaches us that respect for human rights is the best way to prevent conflict and violence. Efforts to realize human rights for all are the best possible investment for a peaceful and prosperous future. Lasting peace and sustainable development cannot be achieved when human rights are abused or violated. And yet the human rights pillar of the United Nations is chronically underfunded and often overlooked. That must change. Human rights are central to my historical experience. The promotion of human rights, both in the bilateral context and on the global scene, remains one of our long-term foreign-policy priorities.\nOur efforts to prevent conflict and instability would not be complete without mentioning denuclearization and the fight against terrorism. The Czech Republic, with its Embassy in Pyongyang, is deeply interested in improving the situation on the Korean peninsula. That is why we are following both the inter-Korean dialogue and the dialogue between the United States of America and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea with raised expectations and at the highest level.\nWe need  a  resolute  and  coordinated  approach to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, just as we do in fighting terrorism. Although the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has been defeated in large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq, we are aware that it is still active and that other terrorist organizations are also operating worldwide. We must take further steps in the area of international law and finally conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. As President Milo\u0161 Zeman suggested at the general debate of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session in 2016 (see  A/71/PV.12), we call for an  internationally recognized definition  of terrorism that will emphasizee the criminal responsibility of terrorists worldwide and enable us to hold them accountable.\nThis year the Czech Republic commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of the day that Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia. The experience of the 1968\n \ninvasion still resonates strongly, and not just in the Czech Republic, as the moment where many lost faith in the promises of a better world preached by the Soviet Union. That historical time period provides lessons that are still relevant today, and its echoes can be heard in incidents that continue to occur in the world around us.\nFirst, it is still not a given that all countries, including those in Eastern Europe, have the right to choose their foreign-policy orientation without their sovereignty and territorial integrity being threatened. In that context, I would like to once again remind the Assembly that the annexation of Crimea represents a blatant violation of international law.\nSecondly, it should not be forgotten that the use of force is allowed by the Charter of the United Nations only in self-defence and when authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter. The United Nations is the sole guarantor of international peace and security. It is only through collective means and within the rules-based international order that the peace and security of all our nations can be achieved.\nThirdly, in cases where States and the international community fail in their shared responsibility to protect people from atrocities, it is imperative to establish accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights. Accordingly, the Czech Republic firmly supports international criminal justice, and in particular the International Criminal Court (ICC). We welcome the activation of the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which we consider to be a deterrent ensuring that such crimes will not be committed in future. In certain cases, however, the ICC does not have jurisdiction, but that should not be seen as a loophole through which perpetrators of atrocities may escape accountability.\nFor crimes committed in Syria, we support, both politically and through financial contributions, the so-called International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. Not only is accountability a way to bring justice to those suffering in conflicts, it is also a path towards reconciliation and a crucial means for preventing atrocities from recurring.\nWhile the newly independent Czech Republic was admitted to the United Nations 25 years ago, in 1993, this year we are also celebrating the centenary of our\nmodern statehood and independence, as Czechoslovakia was born out of the crucible of the First World War in 1918. The founder and first President of my country, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, rightly posited that States are sustained only by those ideals from which they were born. The same must be true of the United Nations. We should therefore strive to reinvigorate the founding ideals of this noble Organization. Only then will we succeed in fulfilling the theme of its seventy- third session, making it truly relevant and helpful to all people."

        "file_text": "I have the honour to address the General Assembly as President of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain. I do so with the emotion that this Hall inspires in me and with respect for the values that gave rise to and guide the daily work of the Organization. I would like to begin by highlighting the fact that, for the first time in history, a Latin American woman is presiding over the Assembly. That is yet another symbol of the fact that global governance in the twenty-first century is inconceivable without the leadership of women. I identify as a feminist politician, and this is without a doubt the time of women.\nI have always believed that multilateralism makes it possible to achieve heights that would be unattainable through the individual actions of States. On that note, I want to underscore the value of agreement and dialogue in confronting the challenges that the international community is facing. Those are challenges that my country, Spain, is addressing with a  spirit  of  hope for collective action against those who instil fear and uncertainty. Our commitment to the United Nations stems from common values and a common conviction; it is the pursuit of justice in all its forms through respect for human dignity, democracy, freedom, equality and human rights; and now, above all and more than ever, it is making the promotion of peace and the well-being of peoples our objectives.\nThe United Nations, like the European project in which my Government firmly believes, was not born out of an idealistic utopia, as some disdainfully make it out to be. It was born out of victory over the forces of hatred, racism and tyranny. Today, the world is facing great global challenges, many of which have been discussed here in the Assembly. We are asked to act on behalf of the people of each of our countries. We are asked and required to prepare real agendas for change. Our times do not require nationalistic or non-inclusive rhetoric. To paraphrase the remarks of the Secretary- General at the opening of the general debate (see A/73/ PV.6), now is the moment to forge a new cooperative leadership, based on a willingness not only  to  listen to others, which is of course important, but also to understand what motivates their positions. Now is the moment to accept, with a deep sense of empathy, that no one alone has a monopoly on the truth; and that we need\n \nleadership that can build consensus, forge agreements and find solutions that leverage synergies.\nWe must not underestimate everything that we have achieved by working together, which is very significant. The world today is a better place than it used to be. It is much better than it would have  been  if the United Nations had never been founded. But in my opinion, the real strength of the Organization does not lie in its past achievements, although there have been many; rather, it lies in all that we can build to win the future. The time is now. We are the last generation with the opportunity to slow the consequences of climate change and the first generation with the tools to eradicate poverty on the planet. It  is, therefore, not a question of seeing obstacles but rather, of seeing opportunities. It is about turning change into a catalyst for achieving sustainable development. That it is not an ideal. It is a real necessity, as many of the previous speakers have stated.\nMany countries face a dilemma: to continue to be open societies or  to become closed societies, as if  a return to the false peace of borders and renouncing collective action were the only means of addressing the uncertainties of these times. We already know where such ideas lead. Now we must look beyond the seeming dictates of these fast-moving times, in which everything seems to change from one minute to the next. Let us move past the lost decade of the economic crisis and the growing inequality that our societies suffer from. Our commitment has a name, a date and goals \u2014 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to which the Government of Spain is fully committed.\nThe late Kofi Annan, to whom I wish to pay tribute, taught us many things. I should like to share one of them with the Assembly. He told us that human rights, social and economic development and security are all interdependent. I would like to recall those pillars, accompanied by an additional thought \u2014 that the dignity of human beings must also be at the heart of our public and political action. The principles that have brought us to this point in our history are not in retreat and never will be. In fact, they are more relevant than ever. That is why Spain will continue to defend those values. Because without dignity and equality between women and men, and without respect for human rights, there will be no peace and development throughout  the world.\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council until 2020, Spain supports initiatives that strengthen the capacity of the Council and the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We are fortunate to have, in the person of the High Commissioner, an individual of political and personal stature \u2014 Michelle Bachelet of Chile. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which celebrates its seventieth anniversary this year, provides the framework for moving forward.\nThere is no greater injustice than that which defines what a human being will or will not  be on  the basis of whether they were born a boy or a girl. How do we measure all that so many generations of our societies have lost by accepting the discrimination between  men and women? Humankind must not tolerate that injustice. We  must develop a  truly global road map in this twenty-first century to eradicate all forms of discrimination, which women still suffer just because they are women \u2014 whether it is gender-based violence, trafficking in women, or female  genital  mutilation. In that endeavour, the United Nations can rely on Spain\u2019s commitment.\nThe Cabinet of Ministers, which I lead, comprises 60 per cent women members, because we aim to lead by example. And the battle is being fought in companies, in education, in society itself and in leadership positions, where glass ceilings remain simply owing to slow progress. I would like to congratulate the Secretary- General on having reached full gender parity in his Senior Management Group for the first time in the history of the United Nations.\nSpain will continue to promote the women and peace and security agenda. It is crucial that women participate as peace brokers in all phases of conflicts and contribute to a resolution. We will continue to support the outstanding work of UN-Women. Spain actively participated in its creation and was the first donor to establish a partnership framework with that organization. My Government has also joined a Circle of Leadership promoted by the Secretary-General to combat sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations operations. It is essential that we promote a zero- tolerance culture in that area.\nThere are no short cuts or quick fixes for the major challenges of our time, such as the crises directly affecting countries such as Spain, in particular the refugee and migration crises. Humankind cannot simply accept as inevitable the fact that 68 million\n \npeople have been forcibly displaced around the world, of whom more than 25  million are refugees, and over 3 million are asylum-seekers.\nAt this session, the General Assembly will adopt the global compact on refugees. That is a great leap forward. We must work closely with the High Commissioner  for Refugees and acknowledge the situation that the refugee turmoil causes in host countries. We should especially bear in mind that 85 per cent of the world\u2019s refugees and asylum-seekers are concentrated in developing countries. Those States need our empathy and commitment, and, above all else, justice and an equitable distribution of that responsibility in which we all have the obligation to help. Spain has suffered the calamities of the economic crisis more than almost any other Western European country. Nonetheless, the vast majority of Spanish society has never turned its back on the tragic situation of migrants.\nIn that connection, I am proud of our society, which has not been drawn into the radical fever of xenophobic discourse based on a culture of fear of the other. Perhaps that is because we remember our own country\u2019s history. We were a country of migrants and refugees as well. And that is why we will not abandon our international commitments. If we take in a boat that is adrift in the Mediterranean with 630 people on board, it is not only because international law demands it, but also because it is a moral imperative.\nSpain welcomes the coming global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which is set to be adopted in Marrakech in December. When migration is safe, orderly and regular, it is possible to benefit from its positive impact. Rather than accepting an image of countries as fortresses, with exclusionary and xenophobic narratives, the Government of Spain champions the  concepts  of  solidarity,   humanity and respect.\nSpain is well aware of what that challenge entails. We are ultimately a country of origin, transit, destination and return. We defend a migration policy whose fundamental goal is to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, environmental degradation or a lack of opportunities for many young people in the world. Ultimately, we must aspire for migration to be a free choice and not a necessity. Such a policy requires dialogue and cooperation with the countries of origin and transit, especially with the African  countries,  and we are working with the European Union and in\nthe Government to devote significant resources to  that issue.\nThere are many forms of poverty. Allow me to underscore the abomination of childhood poverty and the poverty that afflicts women. More than 15 million girls will never have the chance to learn to read or write in primary school, and 330 million women are living on less than $2 a day. To fight that and other forms of poverty, I would like to mention the need for a global perspective and a new twenty-first-century humanism based on the values that have brought the greatest prosperity ever known to humankind.\nThe 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the current embodiment of that spirit, in which humankind and the planet occupy a central place. We must adopt the Agenda as a new global social contract, binding us all and connecting us with future generations. Spain is going to work with determination to make that change. We have approved an action plan for implementing the 2030 Agenda, and we will launch our own national sustainable development strategy. Indeed, many of the measures adopted by  my  Government are directly  tied  to our  commitment  to  meeting  the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely, combating gender violence, taking measures against child poverty and against energy poverty, regaining universality throughout our country\u2019s health-care system, setting policies for grants to advance equal opportunities among young people, and improving workers\u2019 rights. Such actions, in short, fully embrace and are aligned with the 2030 Agenda.\nSpain is therefore moving forward  along  the  path carved out by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda. Spain has done that before, in fact, when we championed the Millennium Development Goals, with the largest contribution from any single donor in the United Nations system, as well as being the first to the Sustainable Development Goals project. Furthermore, Spain also created the Water and Sanitation Cooperation Fund in Latin America and the Caribbean some years ago, in which we have invested more than \u20ac800 million.\nHowever, none of those efforts make any sense unless we tackle the greatest threat of our generation: the impact of climate change. I come from a country where 40 per cent of our surface area is threatened by desertification. We must fight that battle at every level, which means not only addressing its most immediate effects  but  also  addressing  the underlying structural\n \ncauses that exacerbate the changes in our climate that we are witnessing. This is why we are keenly aware of the need to undertake a controlled decarbonization of our economy.\nYesterday, I announced  that  Spain  would  join the Carbon Neutrality Coalition, deepening our commitment  to implementing  ambitious   long-  term strategies for reducing carbon dioxide and greenhouse-gas emissions. That will enable us to fully comply with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We urgently need to make a just ecological transition, laying the foundations for a new production model to which the Spanish Government is fully committed. Our future depends on renewable energy and clean technologies. Only from that starting point will we be able to combine material well-being with social justice and environmental sustainability.\nI also wish to share the fact that Spain will participate constructively in the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will take place in Poland this year, and the climate change summit to be convened by the Secretary-General in 2019. We hope that those meetings will be successful, and Spain will of course contribute constructively and actively to their smooth execution. Ultimately, it is necessary for us to be able to move forward and comply with the Paris Agreement \u2014 we believe that those meetings offer the occasion to advance and achieve our objectives.\nIt is also up to us to make progress in terms of security, but it must be a security focused on human beings. It has taken us a long time, in my opinion, to learn that security is much more than a concept tied  to defence, in the military sense of the term. Security finds its raison d\u2019\u00eatre not in the absence of conflict, but in guaranteeing freedom.\nTerrorism continues to be one of the major threats to our freedom. That phenomenon was not born out of a supposed clash of civilizations, as some have claimed for decades. There are a few areas in which cooperation, along with the multilateralism demonstrated here at the General Assembly and collaborative, cooperative leadership \u2014 to which the Secretary-General alluded in his remarks \u2014 can bear such abundant and beneficial fruit. The fight against terrorist financing networks   is crucial, as are international police and judiciary cooperation and the exchange of information and\nintelligence. I am sure that we would all agree that those aspects are fundamental.\nHowever, it is also essential to combat the hatred and violence that are being echoed in so many forums. We must do all we can to prevent our young people from falling prey to fanaticism and radical, exclusionary discourse. Governments, businesses and civil society must strengthen social and economic integration with a view to keeping recruitment networks from taking over that space. It is here, in that space devoid of expectations for personal development, where we must win the battle against terrorism. Likewise, we  must be able to overcome the slightest hint of division and resentment, while crafting a narrative of solidarity and remembrance that includes the voices of the victims of terrorism and strengthens the cohesion of our societies.\nInvesting in education and in our young people; taking an appropriate and comprehensive view of migratory issues,  providing  the media  with  tools  to combat hate speech \u2014 which are ever-present in global public discussions \u2014 and fighting stereotypes are undoubtedly essential areas of action. Those are precisely the areas that fall under the remit of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, an instrument for dialogue among cultures and religions, which is supported by the Government of Spain.\nThe growing tensions regarding nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass destruction are equally troubling. The world cannot afford another arms race. We must make the effort to regain the consensus that has been lost and strengthen the non-proliferation regime. Spain can, of course, be counted upon to participate and commit. The spread of armed conflicts and their changing nature \u2014 which is increasingly hybrid and complex \u2014 also demand our attention. Spain is firmly committed to strengthening the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace and international security.\nWe therefore support  the  measures  promoted  by the Secretary-General to place prevention and peacebuilding at the centre of the work of the United Nations. We also support his efforts to reform the architecture and management of United Nations peacekeeping operations, to which Spain has been a most active contributor for decades. Over the years, more than 160,000 Spanish troops have served in United Nations peacekeeping operations, demonstrating loyalty and commitment and enjoying the confidence\n \nand support of many of the peoples they serve beyond our borders. Consequently, Spain supports the Secretary-General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping and the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.\nNevertheless, conflict prevention and maintaining and consolidating peace are not enough; wherever a conflict breaks out, we must act. Spain supports respect for and enforcement of international humanitarian law, so that no violation goes unpunished. I call upon the justice system to pursue and prosecute those who commit war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. In that connection the efforts of the International Criminal Court are, in our view, irreplaceable.\nI call also on the leaders of States and of the international community to protect their civilian populations. I believe it is important to underscore that point before the Assembly. Spain strongly supports the Franco-Mexican initiative to limit the use of the veto power in cases of mass atrocity. Humanitarian disasters such as those in Syria and Iraq remind us of the high price of failing to act in time.\nIn order for the multilateral system to be effective, we must renovate and reinforce it \u2014 a recurring theme at the heart of the Assembly. In so doing, we will be defending everything that we believe in, namely, multilateralism. Spain therefore strongly supports the reform of the United Nations system promoted by the Secretary-General. We have before  us the challenge of clearly integrating the pillars of peace, sustainable development and human rights and avoiding the duplications and overlapping that only drag this institution down.\nWe must win back vital public opinion \u2014 something I would like to reflect upon here \u2014 and the favour of a global citizenry that has come of age in an atmosphere of growing scepticism about an  Organization  than can no longer rest on its many past achievements, despite the fact that they are significant and worthy of remembrance. We must now use our ambition in the task of winning over new generations. Our sole source of strength lies in the capacity of the United Nations to project that message to the world. I believe, therefore, that it is fundamental that we serve as role models to be worthy of the example set by those who represent the very best of the United Nations \u2014 the staff who risk their lives in conflict zones. I express my sincerest\nrecognition to all those men and women who work bravely on the ground every day.\nThe challenge of the disrepute into which politics has fallen is also at stake in the multilateral arena. We must win the battle against those who would spread the shadow of uncertainty and have a single goal, namely, to cast doubt on the role of international organizations such as the United Nations. Spain is a solid ally in  that task.\nThere are two issues that I would like, within the context of the United Nations, to call the Assembly\u2019s attention to before concluding.\nFirst is the question of Gibraltar, on  which  Spain\u2019s  position  is  well  known  \u2014  including  by  the Assembly \u2014 and aligned with United Nations doctrine. The United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union means that Gibraltar will also leave the Union. I would like for the Spanish Government  to take advantage of this historic occasion to establish a new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union \u2014 which will inevitably involve Spain \u2014 to bring prosperity to and benefit the entire region. This includes Gibraltarians, as well as those in the wider area of Campo de Gibraltar.\nWe are also concerned, of course, by the persistent crisis in the Western Sahara. Spain defends the central role of the United Nations and would like to contribute to the efforts of the Secretary-General and  his Special Envoy to achieve a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution that will provide for the self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara. This should be done in the context of arrangements consistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\nSpain is a fully fledged democracy and, this year, celebrates the fortieth anniversary of our Constitution, which brought democracy to our country. It also ranks high on global indexes that measure the democratic quality of our countries\u2019  institutions.  Moreover, Spain has made its defence of and commitment to multilateralism a hallmark of our identity, a flag we wave with fervour and conviction whenever we go beyond our borders.\nToday, the world faces major threats,  just  as  it did eight decades ago \u2014 something that has been remarked upon by many speakers. Cooperative leadership, to which Spain subscribes, demands a\n \nrenewed commitment to multilateralism. Solutions to global problems can be found only through cooperation between States \u2014 that is the firm belief of the Spanish Government and of Spanish society as a whole. Let us ensure that the coming decade represents a victory for consensus and a defeat for those who seek only to hear the echoes of their own voices.\nI address the Assembly today in New York, a city that saw the arrival of millions of human beings fleeing from poverty and from political, racial and religious persecution. The immense majority of them were Europeans. Today, on both shores of the North Atlantic, a collective veil of amnesia is being drawn over the memory of what we were and of what we are, namely, sheer diversity.\nAs the great exiled Spanish poet Le\u00f3n Felipe wrote: \u201cIt is not a matter of getting there first on your own, but of arriving together, on time\u201d. Nothing defines the goals of the United Nations better than the vitality of the 2030 Agenda. It represents this decade\u2019s horizon of hope \u2014 one that we must strive towards in order to arrive, as the poet said, together and on time, leaving no one behind.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it is my pleasure to congratulate Mrs. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session and to wish her every success in her work. I\n \nwould also like to express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for the remarkable effectiveness and professionalism with which he led the General Assembly at  its previous session. I  would be remiss  if I did not also commend Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for  his great efforts and noble  endeavours  to reform and steer our Organization in the service of international peace and security. And I want to offer my heartfelt and sincere condolences on the passing of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was known for his honesty, compassion and noble spirit. I had the honour to work closely with him on several issues, particularly the situation in Syria.\nAs we meet today under this one roof,  our  peoples look forward to achieving  their  equitable and legitimate right to peace, development and a life of dignity. They are also trying to build a cohesive and integrated international system capable of confronting the challenges that threaten the existence and survival of human life, such as hunger, disease, epidemics, terrorism, wars, poverty, scarce resources, natural disasters and a lack of incentives for growth. Mauritania is confident that the noble values that underpin the foundation of this Organization can still build a world of understanding, peace, and prosperity.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania, in  hosting the thirty-first African Union Summit in Nouakchott on 2 and 3 July  under the  theme \u201cWinning the  war on corruption, a sustained course  on  the  path  for  the transformation of Africa\u201d,  sought  to  contribute to formulating a comprehensive vision aimed at addressing the challenges posed by corruption, with the goal of freeing our African peoples from that heinous problem. Mauritania has accomplished much in its fight against corruption, adopting a series of measures and procedures aimed at reducing it. We have mobilized our oversight institutions and  adopted  transparency in all financial transactions. We have modernized and developed our tax-collection system, in addition to updating its methods and systems of payment through the introduction this year of a fiscal reform programme that has led to a change in the base national currency.\nUnder the leadership of His Excellency President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, we have adopted an integrated economic policy aimed at ensuring the welfare and prosperity of our citizens. We have built roads, airports and seaports, and our Government has made basic services available, including drinking water and electrical power. We have implemented reforms\ndesigned to speed up growth throughout our economic, mining and oil sectors. We have also enacted a law encouraging investments and have established a free economic zone in the city of Nouadhibou. We expect our economic growth to exceed 4 per cent this year.\nIn order to mitigate the negative impact of climate change on economic growth and life in general, Mauritania has adopted a national policy designed to utilize renewable sources of energy. We are also working on combating sand invasion and have focused on environmental efforts, including the creation of nature reserves. Mauritania has ratified all the international conventions relating to climate change and, as is well known, Nouakchott hosts the headquarters of the African Agency of the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative.\nWe are aware that achieving justice and equity for all members of society and distributing wealth equitably constitute one of the main foundations of a modern State. Mauritania has therefore enacted fundamental reforms in its legal system with the aim of entrenching the concept of the independence of the judiciary and making it known to litigants. We uphold freedom of the press as a strategic choice in our efforts to achieve and enhance democracy. We recently established a public fund to support the private press and streamline the electronic media, and we are working to launch a radio and television broadcasting service. We have abolished prison sentences for issues pertaining to press cases and made public media outlets accessible to all political actors. All of those achievements have  come  thanks to honest political will, aimed at spreading a spirit of freedom and democracy, and they have enabled our country to maintain a leading rank in terms of freedom of the press at the international level. According to Reporters Without Borders, for years Mauritania has repeatedly ranked first in the Arab world in terms of freedom of the press and of expression, a fact that was also confirmed in the most recent report of the United Nations Development Programme.\nMauritania has worked to encourage international accord and has adopted a permanent policy of openness. In that regard, many preparatory meetings and consultations were held with various factions of the opposition in order to reach agreement, culminating in an open political dialogue between the majority and the opposition in 2011, followed by another comprehensive dialogue, between 29 September and 20 October 2016, between the parties of the majority and certain parties\n \nof the opposition, as well as large sections of civil society and independent personalities. These resulted in constitutional amendments that were adopted by referendum on 5 August 2017, which has enhanced  our democracy and the rule of law, as well as the rationalization of public resources.\nThe elections held on 1 and 15 September provided an opportunity for the Mauritanian people to choose their representatives on the legislative,  municipal,  and local councils. In establishing the concept of decentralization, for the first time in its history my country also witnessed the election of local councils tasked with developing various approaches to engaging local groups when dealing with their affairs. The elections were held under the supervision of an independent electoral commission in an atmosphere of peace, security, transparency and fairness, as testified to by politicians, international observers from the African Union and civil-society representatives. All politicians participated in those elections, and  women  occupied a significant position in terms of candidatures as well as the number of seats won. Indeed, a woman is now chairing the local council of the Nouakchott district. Those results show the progress that women have made in recent elections, thanks to national policies that have enabled them to participate at all levels of decision-making, including in political, military and judicial positions. There is also a quota for allocating seats to women in all elected positions.\nOur national leadership also attaches special importance to young people and has established a multidimensional strategy based on comprehensive approaches that deal with all aspects of interest to young people in the areas of politics, intellectual achievement, education, vocational training and employment. We have also established a higher council for youth and a national employment agency.\nHuman rights are a very important part of our national policies and are embodied in our continuing efforts to entrench those rights, improve prison conditions, protect prisoners from torture and combat the abuse of women and children, as well as definitively eliminating any remnants of slavery. In that regard, our national legislation classified slavery as a crime against humanity as part of our 2012 constitutional amendments. The legal system has also been bolstered by a group  of laws and regulations that adopt new approaches, including establishing ad hoc  courts that  specialize in cases related to the remnants of slavery throughout\nthe country. In March 2014 we issued a road map that includes the implementation of 29 recommendations on combating slavery and its remnants, efforts that have been praised by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery. My Government has established a social-welfare agency working to combat poverty and remnants of slavery. Its tasks include helping our most vulnerable groups by offering health care and educational services and funding income-generating projects.\nThis year our country, which supported the South African people in their struggle against  the  policies of apartheid, welcomed the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit (see A/73/PV.4 and 5) honouring the great role of the late Nelson Mandela. In that regard, I would like to recall that we honoured the late leader and advocate Madiba by naming one of our capital\u2019s largest streets after him. The African Union Summit also recently held events in Nouakchott specially dedicated to honouring his centenary, with a view to recalling the values and ideals for which he fought.\nMauritania\u2019s unique geographic position, together with its Arab and African affiliations, gives it a particular responsibility with regard to the security, economic and human systems in the subregion. We have fully assumed that responsibility and played a pivotal role in establishing the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5). Mauritania has worked practically to help form the Joint Force of the G-5 for the Sahel, which is currently fighting terrorist organizations in the region. In that connection, Mauritania is working to achieve harmony and amity in the subregion by adopting a firm policy of good-neighbourliness and disengagement from any conflict. We are also closely following the Western Sahara issue, and we support United Nations efforts to reach a settlement that is acceptable to the relevant parties and contributes to achieving economic integration between the countries of the Arab Maghreb Union.\nThe question of Palestine is extremely important to Mauritania and is reflected in our firm position on the issue. We have consistently called for a viable equitable solution based on the relevant Arab and international terms of reference and capable of leading to the establishment of an independent State of Palestine with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\nWith regard to the Libyan issue, we support the United Nations efforts and other complementary\n \ntracks, including the work of the African Union Ad Hoc High-level Committee on Libya, the Quartet and Libya\u2019s neighbours.\nRegarding the situation in Syria, we underscore the need to strive seriously for a political solution through a comprehensive national dialogue that preserves Syria\u2019s unity and independence, as well as the dignity of its people and their right to live in security and peace. As for brotherly Yemen, we reiterate our support for the legitimate leadership of President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour. We call for an end to division and the adoption of a peaceful solution based on the three terms of reference. We also support United Nations efforts aimed at reaching a political solution to that crisis. We affirm our support to the Government of Somalia in restoring security and stability in its territory and once again condemn all terrorist activities that target vital centres in Somalia.\nConcerning the Rohingya Muslims, we reiterate our firm condemnation of the killings and displacement inflicted on that minority group, and call on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities in putting an end to that oppressed people\u2019s suffering.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm Mauritania\u2019s respect  for  all  of  its international  commitments. We honour the multilateral international  order  and the principles of the United Nations, which seek to establish a world of security and stability where people live in prosperity and peace. Mauritania stands ready to work with its partners to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to congratulate President Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly. Her unanimously recognized qualities and talent will certainly guarantee the success of the work of the Assembly at its seventy- third session. I would also like to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General and to acknowledge his courageous efforts to improve the effectiveness of the United Nations system, as part of the collective search for, in the words of Pope Francis, the \u201ccommon good of humanity\u201d.\nOver the years, the General Assembly has been confronted with two underlying questions related to the main topics on its agenda. How can we optimize our mechanisms for maintaining international peace and security? And how can we translate the need for international solidarity into a much more effective system of cooperation, capable of promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty in the world?\nThe United Nations has rightly shed light on the close links between the eradication of  poverty  and the promotion of  sustainable  development,  peace  and security. Similarly, the fight against poverty is inextricably linked to the promotion of human rights. Extreme poverty is a denial of human dignity and must therefore be at the heart of United Nations efforts, allowing hundreds of millions of men and women to cherish the hope of one day seeing its eradication.\nIntensifying the fight against global warming, which is one of the most serious threats to humankind, must also be one of the international community\u2019s urgent priorities. The 2016 Paris Agreement on Climate Change was a milestone in this regard. Every effort should also be made to ensure that international obligations and the commitments that arise from them are respected. We are well aware that climate-change adaptation and mitigation regimes and precautionary measures to alleviate damage are extremely costly. One component of any sustainable development strategy, the mitigation of natural hazards, is essential as an investment today in anticipation of events that may occur tomorrow. However, to date, the funding is clearly inadequate to a response that matches the scope of the challenges before us.\nMobilizing new resources for climate change is a top priority. We should point out that the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries, especially small island States, and above all those in the Caribbean, including the Republic of Haiti, emit few greenhouse  gases,  and yet suffer most of the damage caused by increasingly frequent and violent hurricanes. The promises made at last year\u2019s One Planet Summit in Paris to enable those countries to adapt their environments and mitigate the ravaging effects of climate change must be kept.\nI would like to shed some light on the situation in Haiti one year after the closure of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which was succeeded by the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. Since assuming the presidency of the Republic of Haiti, I have worked tirelessly to consolidate the rule of law, deepen democratic gains and promote human rights, as I am firmly convinced of the absolute necessity of modernizing our economic, social and political structures in order to enable my country to emerge from the trap of underdevelopment. I have spared no effort to ensure that institutions are stable and create a safe and stable environment that is conducive to investment and restarting growth. In the\n \nface of ever scarcer resources and the strong pressure of the population\u2019s needs, the Caravan of Change is, in this respect, an innovative strategy that aims to put all the State\u2019s resources at the service of the Haitian people.\nThe social, political and economic modernization processes undertaken by the Government have achieved numerous tangible results over the past 18 months. In this regard, I need only refer to the Secretary-General\u2019s latest report on Haiti (S/2018/795), which highlights the important progress made in terms of political and institutional stability, the protection of human rights, strengthening the judicial system and improving the security environment. However, despite these advances, we must recognize that our sluggish economic growth continues to weigh heavily on the national strategy for development and sustaining peace.\nThe fact is that we are facing interrelated and wide-ranging challenges that are compounded by population pressure, major urbanization, environmental degradation and extreme vulnerability to natural disasters. The 2010 earthquake, the Assembly will recall, caused damage equal to 120 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP). On top of that, the damage from Hurricane Matthew was equivalent  to 32 per cent of GDP. This structural and environmental vulnerability is not without consequences.\nIn July, following the enforcement of a law on a fuel price adjustment backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we experienced an unfortunate and painful popular uprising in response to the requirements of the IMF-backed staff-monitored programme. Haiti, which does not produce oil, is therefore dealing with the difficult requirement of having to continue financing Government fuel subsidies.\nThe violent expression of discontent from some parts of the population cannot be underestimated. It acutely highlighted the key issue of the risks associated with extreme socioeconomic insecurity and a lack of economic prospects, as well as the fragility of the gains we have made so far. However real and indisputable those hard-fought gains may be, they may be jeopardized without adequate long-term support.\nOne of the lessons that we have learned from the crisis is that while structural reforms are essential, they are lengthy processes that cannot be accomplished in a short time or subjected to the often overly rigid conditions that are imposed by technical and financial partners without taking into account the socioeconomic\nrealities of each country. While I do not wish  to assign blame, I should note that the recent uprising was in large part the result of an overly narrow vision of development aid that does not always allow our international partners to recognize the  need  for  a less fragmented and rigid, more integrated and more coherent approach to interrelated development and security issues that is much more in line with the five principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action.\nIn other words, the success of the strategy for sustaining peace and the gains made, which is vitally important to us, depends largely on our ability to obtain the additional resources that will enable us to overcome our structural handicaps, including boosting public investment in critical infrastructure and overcoming obstacles to growth that keep nearly three quarters of the population below the poverty line.\nI would like to reiterate here, before the Assembly, the solemn commitment I have made to the Haitian people and the international community to spare no effort in resolutely guiding the  country on  a  path to  a  sustainable development that is based on  the rule   of law, political stability, the tireless, relentless and persistent struggle against corruption in all its forms, the modernization of institutions, socioeconomic progress and the consolidation of democratic gains and achievements in the field of human rights, which, I am convinced, are irreversible.\nThe newly formed Government of National Unity has embarked on that task with a renewed plan of action and a number of priority objectives and benchmarks. They include immediately improving the living conditions of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable segments of the population through innovative programmes; improving the business climate; reviving public and private investment for growth and the creation of jobs, in order to foster the expansion of the middle class and significantly reduce social inequality and exclusion in all its forms; pursuing further reforms aimed at consolidating the rule of law, strengthening the justice system and the national police force, alongside the ongoing remobilization of the Haitian armed forces; fighting corruption in all its forms and manifestations; holding legislative elections in October 2019, as planned; and intensifying measures to strengthen the promotion and defence of human rights.\n \nAt this crossroads, I urge our partners in the international community to continue to offer the Haitian people active solidarity, within the framework of a renewed, coherent and substantial assistance programme, which will be aligned with national priorities and implemented in close  collaboration  with national institutions and the private business sector, and thereby better adapted to the realities on the ground. This paradigm shift will significantly strengthen national efforts and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals that we have set for ourselves as a first step and to eradicating poverty by 2030.\nWe cannot repeat it often enough \u2014 peace, development and security go hand in hand . They must be adequately supported by appropriate long-term investment. In particular, they require an allocation  of resources better adapted to the real needs of recipient countries, taking into account their structural vulnerabilities. This resource allocation must be  more flexible and less subject to conditions that could ultimately undermine the very viability of reforms and key development goals, including long-term stability. Access to good electrical, digital, school, health, environmental, hydraulic and  road  infrastructure  is a prerequisite for any country that aims to achieve sustainable development. The Republic of Haiti received nearly $11 billion in donations and loans between 2006 and 2016, and yet some of that infrastructure is still not in place.\nHow can we talk about sustainable development when there is no drinking water in families\u2019 taps? How can we speak of sustainable development when there  is no water for the irrigation of agricultural land? How can we speak of sustainable development when there are no good roads linking cities and villages? How can we speak of sustainable development when there is no electrical or digital infrastructure? How can we speak of sustainable development when there is no adequate school or sanitary infrastructure? It is those questions that we ask ourselves, the answers to which we are tirelessly striving to find for the Haitian people.\nIn order to build a suitable electrical and digital transmission and distribution network over Haiti\u2019s 27,750   square   kilometres,   we   need approximately\n$400 million. The Republic of Haiti has nearly 1 million hectares of agricultural land, half of which can be easily irrigated. Unfortunately, only 5 per cent of that land is irrigated, meaning that we need $675 million to\nmake an additional 450,000 hectares viable. We need only 220 million cubic metres of water each year to make household tap water available across Haiti. Yet 40 billion cubic metres of surface water are dumped into the sea every year. Approximately $300 million would enable us to treat the 220 million cubic metres needed to serve all of Haiti\u2019s communes.\nWe need to produce 50 million fruit and forest tree seedlings each year to be able to reforest the country. The construction of 14 germplasm and plant propagation centres, which would be able to produce 63 million seedlings a year, costs approximately $35 million. With regard to education, we need 15,000 classrooms to enable the 500,000 children who are not yet in school to have access to a good basic education. We need approximately $450 million to build those classrooms. Moreover, we need 122 health-care centres to fill the deficit across communes, which will cost $20 million. I also take this opportunity to challenge the international community on the obligation to mobilize resources to eliminate cholera, which was introduced by MINUSTAH in Haiti, and to compensate the victims. In addition,  in order to connect and renovate the 146 communes of Haiti and improve certain sections of roads, we need\n$800 million. From this rostrum, I would like to say to our technical and financial partners that together we must muster the courage to rethink development aid for Haiti and other countries in similar situations, using the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action as our guides.\nWith the Republic of Haiti\u2019s meagre financial resources, we have begun to rebuild the country. Today more than ever, we need that synergy to build the future of our country. We must work together, while scrupulously respecting Haiti\u2019s priorities. The fight against corruption that began on 7 February 2017 cannot remain wishful thinking. It is a battle that will allow us to bequeath to future generations a better country in which life is worth living.\n"

I wish her every success in her noble task.\nI would also like to express my appreciation for the tireless efforts of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in reforming our Organization, strengthening its role and achieving its noble objectives. I reiterate Morocco\u2019s full support for his initiatives, especially in the areas of peacekeeping, peacebuilding, modernizing the working mechanisms of the Organization and achieving sustainable development.\nThe world is facing various challenges and resulting transformations that require us to adopt innovative approaches in order to advance multilateralism, which is suffering a real crisis. We therefore need to define consensus concepts in addressing global issues and making international organizations effective and able to adapt to continuing transformation. Addressing and debating this reality is not merely an intellectual act but an explicit call to think realistically and objectively about the outcomes of the United Nations work with the aim of promoting its capabilities and realizing its goals.\nIn this context, Morocco, through the vision of  His Majesty King Mohammed VI, believes that the development of multilateral action requires particular attention to the three pillars of security, development and human rights. The year 2018 has furthered the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015. It is also a year in which we recall two historic events in our collective undertaking that established the identity of the United Nations, devoted to shared, universal human values and entrenched international peace and security.\nThe first historic event took place 70 years ago, when the United Nations deployed its first peacekeeping mission. That leads us to recall the fundamental role that the Organization plays in peacekeeping, based on the peaceful resolution of international and regional disputes, respect for the sovereignty of States and their territorial integrity and independence. At the sixty- seventh session of the General Assembly, His Majesty King Mohamed VI, through Prince Moulay Rachid, underscored from this rostrum that\n\u201c[a]chieving international peace and security remains the core historic mission entrusted to the United Nations. The tens of thousands of United Nations peacekeepers serving throughout the world to protect civilians and working to bring about the\nright conditions for political dialogue between the concerned parties clearly attest to the vital role played by our Organization in that regard.\u201d (A/67/ PV.16, p. 10).\nIn his letter addressed to the Secretary-General early this month, His Majesty also underlined the appreciation of the Kingdom of Morocco for his initiative to organize a high-level meeting during this session on developing the work of United Nations peacekeeping operations. Morocco fully supports the final communiqu\u00e9 of the meeting.\nThe second historic event is the adoption on\n10 December 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the seventieth anniversary of  which we will celebrate this year. The Declaration laid the first foundation stone for universal human rights, leading to established joint universal values in  the area of  human rights. It  also served as an incentive to adopt other international conventions on civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. In that regard, Morocco underscores its commitment to human rights as internationally recognized. We call once again for the noble principles of human rights to be elements of convergence among nations, without any biased politicization.\nMultilateral work that is based on balance, realism, effectiveness, openness and ambition is among the priorities of the foreign policy of the Kingdom of Morocco, as established by King Mohammed. Now more than ever we need to work together to identify consensus approaches based on humanity and solidarity in order to address shared challenges, particularly with respect to climate change, the fight against terrorism, and migration. It is in this  spirit  that  His  Majesty has launched an effort to mobilize the world to limit the impact of climate change. He made the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Morocco a historical event for implementing the commitments undertaken at the Paris Climate Change Conference.\nIn the same spirit, Morocco has contributed with resolve and firmness to international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and cross-border security threats. Given our recognized experience, we have contributed to developing international, regional and national approaches in that regard. The Kingdom of Morocco has continued its contribution to mobilize international efforts to combat terrorism, including through its joint\n \npresidency, together with the Netherlands, of the Global Counterterrorism Forum.\nOn the subject of migration, King Mohammed, as a pioneer in migration policies within the African Union, presented the African Agenda on Migration, which was adopted in Addis Ababa at the thirty-first summit of the African Union, in January 2018. At the international level, Morocco, together with  Germany,  co-chairs  the Global Forum on Migration. The outcomes  of these international and African  events  have  helped to strengthen the preparations for the global compact for migration.\nIn the past few months, and for the first time in history, negotiations have resulted in an international consensus on a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which will be adopted at a high- level meeting scheduled to take place in Marrakech, in Morocco, on 10 and 11 December. That meeting will be a historically transformative moment in dealing with migration. It will establish a new global order based on dialogue, consultation and cooperation, while positively addressing migration as a fundamental human dynamic in the development of societies, bringing civilizations closer together and achieving development. Everyone is, of course, welcome in Marrakech.\nGiven our firmly anchored African identity and our close historic and human ties with the African countries, Morocco has made its relations with the African continent one of the top priorities of its foreign policy, within a framework of integrated and proactive strategic vision. Morocco is proud of its African nature and of its distinctive relations with its African brothers. King Mohammed is eager to propose African solutions to every African problem on the international agenda in order to support African and international efforts to attain peace, development and good governance.\nMorocco supports all initiatives to achieve prosperity and stability on the African continent, which is why we are honoured to co-chair the Sustainability, Security and Stability initiative with Senegal, seeking to combat desertification in Africa by reclaiming arid lands and providing stability for their inhabitants, enabling them and their families to live a decent life. I would like to take this opportunity to call on the States Members of the United Nations to actively participate in the success of this important event related to Africa and its development.\nMorocco is  a  member  of  the  African  Peace and Security Council and intends to shoulder its responsibility for mobilizing every effort to preserve security and peace while promoting stability on the African continent, in support of United Nations efforts in this area.\nThe dangers facing the Middle East demand that we come up with a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question, which is at the heart of the conflicts in the region, along with its security and stability. The Kingdom of Morocco calls on the United Nations to focus its efforts on relaunching the political process on a basis of the relevant international and bilateral terms of reference so that the Palestinian people can enjoy their legitimate rights, particularly the creation of an independent State across the entire Palestinian national territory, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco is aware of the importance of Jerusalem to the three monotheistic religions and the whole world. I emphasize that Morocco  rejects any change to the historic, legal and political status of the city of Jerusalem, in the light of the fact that King Mohammed presides over the Al-Quds Committee. We call for international efforts to maintain its status and protect it against any action targeting it.\nAnother source of concern in the Middle East and North Africa is the interference of certain regional Powers in the internal affairs of some Arab countries, including the Kingdom of Morocco, which undermines their security and stability and threatens their sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity. Morocco wants to take this opportunity to reaffirm  its rejection and condemnation of such aggressive and destructive attitudes. We call on those Powers to refrain from this approach, which runs counter to international law, international relations and the principle of good- neighbourliness. We call on them to adopt informed options and to sincerely and courageously participate in establishing a safe, stable and welcoming region.\nThe contrived regional dispute over Western Sahara remains a principal source of instability in the region and an obstacle to joint action and the integration of the Maghreb. That is why it is essential to work diligently to find a lasting political solution through efforts in which Algeria, if it is serious, should be effectively and directly involved, given its historical and political responsibility for creating, fuelling and  prolonging the dispute.\n \nThe Kingdom of Morocco underlines its full commitment to the terms of reference adopted by the Security Council to address this contrived dispute. The Council is the only international body mandated to address the political aspect of the dispute, by adopting a spirit of realism and consensus and working to reach a realistic, practical and lasting solution, as provided for in the Council\u2019s resolutions, particularly resolution 2414 (2018). In that regard, Morocco underscores its support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, aimed at achieving a final and agreed political solution to this dispute, based on the position expressed by King Mohammed in his address on the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People, on 20 August.\nHis Majesty stressed that Morocco will continue to\n\u201cengage with full trust and commitment in the dynamic work generated by the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, based on the same terms of reference that we identified in the last Green March address. We note with satisfaction the growing harmony between these principles and the international positions\u201d.\nIn parallel, Morocco continues to make every effort to promote the development model in the southern Sahara. We support an advanced, decentralized system that would enable the inhabitants of the Moroccan Sahara to manage their own affairs in an environment of democracy, stability and sustainable development.\nIt is with deep regret that we recall the disastrous situation in which our  detained  brothers  are  living in the camps at Tindouf. We reiterate our firm and non-negotiable demand for the international community to compel Algeria to assume all its political, legal and humanitarian responsibilities as the host country. It should allow the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to carry out its mandate by conducting a census of those people, on  the basis of Security Council resolutions and in response to the numerous appeals made by the Secretary General and various humanitarian bodies over the years.\nWe firmly believe that the major changes and transformations in our world today require urgent, strong and concerted efforts on the part of all members of the international community, whoever they are and regardless of their interests. Multilateralism is contrary to isolation and to perpetuating the status quo. It is a symbol of progress, understanding and adaptation. The\nmultilateral system, despite the criticism it faces, will remain essential to addressing the challenges and issues facing the international community.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco will continue to be an active and responsible Member of the United Nations and the international community. The Kingdom of Morocco will continue to believe in the principles of the Organization, in which we have confidence, thanks to its multilateral work.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to bring the Assembly warm greetings of yokwe on behalf of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nIn its best moments, the United Nations has  served as a common platform for every nation, but especially the most vulnerable. Today nations are pulling in new directions, stretching the threads that hold us all together and pushing the world to the edge. It is imperative that the States Members of the United Nations continue to unite behind an international rules- based order that does not overlook the voices of the most vulnerable peoples. As a former United Nations strategic trusteeship, the Marshall Islands can speak with authority from its own history of the times when the sheer will of the most powerful ravaged our shores and when the common concerns of humankind failed us, as well as those times when it ensured that our Marshallese voices mattered. We welcome engagement with the world\u2019s largest Powers but they must have our best interests at heart.\nHuman rights stand as a challenging universal ideal that all must aspire to and uphold. The Human Rights Council has tremendous potential to provide transparency and dialogue and foster progress. While we must take more time to carefully connect global norms and national implementation, because one size never fits all, the United Nations must never hesitate\n \nto stand up to actors who seek to evade what everyone else might see as common decency.  And that is  not  an abstract statement. From our own history and contemporary challenges, the Marshall Islands knows the dire consequences that arise when the international community looks the other way because of political expediency. Far more political will  is  needed  to  truly ensure that no one is left behind. Whatever the shortcomings of the Human Rights Council, it is the responsibility of Member States to address. We must fix it ourselves. We will not stand by in silence.\nFor those reasons, the Republic of the Marshall Islands has put forward its candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the term from 2020 to 2022. Real commitment is in actions, not in words. As an example, we have not only enacted disability rights legislation to meet our treaty obligations, we currently have a bill before Parliament that amends more than 100 existing statutes to ensure that we mainstream rights across all sectors. We are moving towards a similar undertaking on the issue of gender. Our partners, including the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, have already been key sources of assistance, but it is our political will that can make it a reality. Human rights are not just treaty signatures; they are a visible step-change in our local communities.\nSmall nations can have a unique role within the multilateral system. We would not have the United Nations Law of the Sea, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or a great many other outcomes but for the political will of small island developing States (SIDs). We represent a quarter of this body\u2019s membership, but does the United Nations system invest equally in us? We will struggle to tackle the Sustainable Development Goals unless there is urgent attention to putting our own data capacity to use from the international system. Many of our core social development indicators sit stagnant. While we are trying to change all of this, we cannot do so without an international system that is directly focused on our unique character.\nI strongly support the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative for United Nations system reform \u2014 to do more and do it better, with the resources at hand. Our present United Nations Resident Coordinator is not a resident at all and faces the impossible task of effectively serving 10 remote nations at once. I look forward to the upcoming review of the United Nations multi-country offices, mandated in resolution 72/279, and urge innovative solutions.\nThis year is a key opportunity for the United Nations system to make the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway for small island developing States a real opportunity for system change.\nDecades ago, small island developing States warned the world of the risks of climate change, and those are still radical threats. Now we must  spend time on advocacy. It is time that we literally do not have. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change stands strong as a powerful and  united  legal  commitment on the part of all \u2014  the  largest and smallest among us \u2014 to sparing no effort in doing more to ensure a rise in average temperatures of no more than 1.5\u00ba C. I strongly support the Secretary-General\u2019s forthcoming 2019 climate summit. It is an opportunity at the highest levels for leaders to reshape headlines and put the Paris Agreement into motion by responding to the urgent needs for enhanced action and ambition at true scale. It is not just a moral promise, but an economic reality, as energy markets already point to better choices.\nI am not asking others to do things that we will not do at home. This week, I announced that the Marshall Islands is transitioning to a net-zero emissions target by 2050. We are already taking action, not only to meet that goal but also to increase our near-term ambitions and accelerate adaptation efforts. In raising our ambitions, I know we will not be alone. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders, in last month\u2019s Boe Declaration, declared climate change to be the single greatest security threat to our region. That political will must extend to urgent and prioritized assistance to help  atoll  nations such  as the Marshall Islands, whose very survival is  at risk, to adapt to the climate-driven threats we already face and prevent a future tipping point only a decade or two away. Much more political effort is needed on scaling and targeting climate finance so that good intentions from partners can make a visible impact in local communities.\nAs a low-lying atoll island nation little more than one metre above sea level, the Marshall Islands have a future that hangs in the balance, but that is not the case for us alone. Although as an atoll nation we are the most vulnerable, we are joined not only by other small island developing States but by many other countries that face serious challenges posed by climate impacts. As Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, I call on every leader in the world to join me on 22 November in an online virtual summit to ensure that no one and no country is left behind.\n \nThe Marshall Islands emerged from the colonial period, the Second World War and the effects of nuclear testing conducted more than six decades ago. As we were adopting our Constitution in 1979 and becoming a State Member of the United Nations in 1991, we were focused entirely on building a nation to leave behind for our children. Only 27  years  later,  now  facing  the consequences of climate change, we are asking ourselves what legacy we as a nation will leave for our grandchildren to inherit.\nLast year\u2019s United Nations Ocean Conference set the stage to ensure that the oceans, which cover two thirds of the world\u2019s surface, must no longer be an isolated silo but must become an integral part of sustainable development and global commitment. The Marshall Islands is more than 99 per cent ocean. It is our culture, our primary economic pathway and our identity. The world must move far beyond words and towards actions because we should all be gravely alarmed at what has too often become a downward spiral.\nEarlier this year, the eight Pacific leaders of the parties to the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest met in the Marshall Islands, the first such leaders\u2019 meeting since 2010. In the intervening years, we have rewritten the playbook for global tuna markets, working to ensure that ours will not only be an economic lifeline for our future generations but will also remain a valuable source of global food security and the world\u2019s largest sustainable purse-seine tuna fishery.\nIn that regard, I welcome the outreach and engagement of the Group of Seven leaders, under the leadership of Canada, to focus on oceans and fisheries. International development finance  sources must improve targeted delivery and direct support. Marine plastic pollution is crippling global waters, and illegal fishing in the Pacific is more than a violation of law and treaty, it is a major regional security issue. Next week, the Marshall Islands  will  host  the  launching of a regional initiative for a Pacific region free of illegal, unreported and  unregulated fishing in order  to eradicate illegal fishing from our region once and for all. Enhanced efforts on illegal fishing are needed from regional fisheries management organizations, and we should not be afraid to name and shame the worst offenders.\nAs the first woman Head of State or Government in the independent Pacific islands region, I say that\nit is vital that the United Nations accelerate efforts to ensure that all women, and especially our youngest generations, must see that they have a rightful role at all levels of decision-making, including the highest levels of political leadership and economic development. After all, we women represent the half of the world\u2019s population that is not yet fully reflected among the ranks of global leaders.\nFor too many years, multilateral discussions to end nuclear weapons have gone in circles. I strongly welcome progress whenever it is found and remain cautiously optimistic of efforts towards a safe and secure Korean peninsula, with complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. However, until that is achieved, the Marshall Islands strongly affirms its commitment to the full implementation of the Security Council\u2019s sanctions, including in the maritime sector.\nThreats of atmospheric testing in the Pacific Ocean are of obvious concern to me and my fellow Pacific island leaders, and for  every  Marshallese  citizen,  the effects of nuclear testing are not only a historical legacy, but a contemporary reality. Those were the only instances where the United Nations ever explicitly authorized the testing of nuclear weapons, and the consequences have been horrific. The 67 nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1946 and 1958 have affected multiple generations.\nThose tests took place at a time when we held status as a United Nations strategic trust territory, including testing that was authorized by United Nations Trusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV) and 1493 (XVII). That is a burden that no other nation or people should ever bear. That is not only a lesson that the world must learn from, but a situation where the United Nations has already offered its assistance. My Government recently established a national nuclear commission to work carefully with affected local communities and regional and international agencies to better elaborate our complex issues and develop a strategy for nuclear justice. It is vital that we make every possible effort, with all possible speed, to help us address human rights issues and the environment of our affected people.\nThe Security Council and the United Nations as a whole must adapt and change. This is not the world of seven decades ago. It is important to realize Security Council reform and launch text-based negotiations\n \nfor Security Council reform during this session of the General Assembly.\nDecolonization and human rights are both important issues in the Pacific islands region. I strongly affirm the position of the Pacific Island Forum leaders in recognizing the  constructive engagement of Forum countries with Indonesia with respect to elections and human rights issues in West Papua, and the commitment to continuing dialogue in an open and constructive manner.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands supports the recognition of Taiwan\u2019s meaningful participation within the United Nations system, including programmes  and agencies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The people of Taiwan deserve equal treatment, and the United Nations should resolve the serious issue of the exclusion of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people from the United Nations system, an issue that we believe is not addressed in resolution 2758 (XXVI).\nTaiwan has been implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and has released a voluntary national review.  It  has the  capacity to  contribute to  a wide range of United Nations programmes that are relevant to global progress. Diseases such as tuberculosis know no boundaries, and Taiwan has brought its policy framework in line with global efforts. Taiwan has served as a primary partner of my own nation in addressing non-communicable diseases, which are now at crisis levels. Blocking Taiwan\u2019s participation does not benefit global human welfare.\nIn conclusion, it is imperative that, as truly united nations, we take to heart the national motto of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Jepilpin ke Ejukaan, which translates as \u201caccomplishment through joint effort\u201d. What we do as leaders at the United Nations and beyond is a legacy for the next generation and those that follow.\n"

        "file_text": "Canada  is  honoured to help close the general debate at the seventy-third session of the General Assembly. Let me start with a simple question. Why does the United Nations matter? The answer is also simple. The magnitude of the contemporary challenges that the world is confronting, from climate change to terrorism, from economic inequality to irregular migration, from protracted crises to humanitarian emergencies, demands action. Each of those challenges is systemic. None can be solved by countries acting in isolation or bilaterally. All of them require the world to work together. The United Nations is the only place where we all come together to tackle those challenges. Indeed, the General Assembly \u2014 our Assembly \u2014 is the only forum where representation is global. That representation not only bestows legitimacy, it affords opportunities to harness diversity of thought and experience, skills and knowledge, and ideas, in support of better outcomes for all.\nSince the beginning of the post-war project, Canada has been at the heart of the United Nations. We were among the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We were there at the advent of peacekeeping. We helped to build the institutions at the core of the rules-based international order. But those rules and institutions were not, and should not be, seen as static entities, impervious to change. Notwithstanding their tremendous achievements, we should acknowledge that the benefits of those rules and institutions have not been evenly distributed. Too many remain excluded, economically, socially and politically, from the decision-making that affects their lives.\nThe great generation that came out of  the ashes of the Second World War was great not because times were simpler, or the challenges less complex. They were great because they found a way to work together, in common cause for collective outcomes. Their work helped to ensure stability and relative peace and security for over 70 years. We owe it to them, and to ourselves, to continue to work together to make our multilateral world order more efficient, fairer and more inclusive. That is why supporting the implementation of the current United Nations reforms, led by our Secretary- General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, is so essential.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a phenomenal achievement of the United Nations. For the first time in history, we agreed on a comprehensive strategic plan to achieve a sustainable world. The plan brings us into uncharted territory. Sticking to old approaches will not help us meet its targets.\nWe should find new ways  of  doing  things  and for breaking silos open, not only here at the United Nations but also between Governments and civil society, between Governments and the private sector, between North and South and between the traditional so-called like-minded and non-traditional like-minded. We should do things differently at the United Nations and in our Governments so as to better deliver results for people on the ground. We should hold fresh, frank\n \nand inclusive discussions. We should develop a greater sense of urgency. We should reconsider our approach to risk \u2014 inaction is a risk for Governments and people, but also for investors. We should identify the opportunities in our challenges. We should look at new partnerships to harness new opportunities.\nAs our Secretary-General says, climate change is the defining issue of our time. A significant component of the response to climate change requires new, greener and more resilient infrastructure. That represents a\n$26 trillion opportunity for us all. To harness that opportunity, starting with the most vulnerable \u2014 the small island States \u2014 we must all work together with scientists, multilateral institutions, regional banks, investors and civil society like never before.\nNot building essential infrastructure is not an option. As Prime Minister Trudeau and others have said, developing countries should  not  be  punished for a problem they did  not  create,  nor  should  they be deprived the opportunities for clean growth that developed nations are now pursuing. And we should all support Africa as it works to create opportunities for its youth and strives to meet the ambitions of its Agenda 2063 of the African Union through greater economic integration and prosperity. Doing so is key to a more secure world. Greater and more shared prosperity leads to greater peace.\nBringing people together is at the heart of Canada\u2019s national identity. In Canada, we have come to understand that diversity is our strength. The indigenous peoples in Canada are the bedrock of our diversity. They speak more than 60 different languages, and their cultures are some of the richest on the continent. One in every five Canadians was born outside the country. Our largest urban centres are among the most cosmopolitan on earth. Over 50 per cent of the populations of both Vancouver and Toronto were born outside Canada.\nCanada has become home to refugees and new Canadians for decades. While we are very proud to have welcomed more than 50,000 Syrian refugees over the past three years, we are fully aware that many countries have also shown great leadership in welcoming many more. I must say that one of the things that makes me very proud is that 40 per cent of the Syrian refugees that we have welcomed have been directly sponsored by private citizens of Canada, who wanted to do their part.\nOf course, our track record in promoting economic and social integration will always require work and action. While we have made important progress, we have made mistakes and still face challenges \u2014 the most important of which remains reconciliation with First Nations. We in Canada understand that we need to listen and learn in order to contribute to better outcomes. It is what we intend to do, both at  home and abroad.\nWe are using our Group of 7 (G-7) presidency this year both to listen and learn from others, in addition to innovating and breaking down silos. For the first time, in order to ensure that Governments were delivering in a more cohesive manner, Canada convened ministers of finance and ministers of international development together to explore new ways of financing development. We can no longer afford to have discussions at the United Nations that are distinct from those at the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.\nWe also felt very  strongly  that  the  G-7  needed to tackle the issue of climate resilience and disaster recovery. While Canada has its own extensive coastlines and borders on three oceans, we invited small island, coastal African and South-East Asian States to that critical conversation. Building on the United Nations Ocean Conference, that discussion produced a charter seeking to ban the use of plastics in our oceans and is paving the way towards the sustainable blue economy conference in November in Nairobi that Canada is so proud to be co-hosting with Kenya.\nWe partnered with the World Bank and other countries to raise  close  to  $3.8  billion  to  reduce  the barriers that women and girls face in accessing education in conflict and fragile States. Their inclusion will lead to exceptional benefits for their communities, and by extension, for the world. Last week, here at the United Nations, another $527 million were pledged by four other countries. We also need capital that flows faster and at scale in emerging and frontier markets. For that reason, we are also working together with partners from across the United Nations and the private sector to unlock capital that can connect people to opportunities.\nAs a direct result  of  the  work  that  we  do  here at the United Nations, just a few days ago at the high-level meeting on financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Prime Minister Trudeau announced  the  establishment  of  a  Toronto   affiliate\n \nof the Global Infrastructure Hub to do precisely that: leverage Canadian expertise in infrastructure to help connect capital to projects. Those projects fuel long- term economic  growth  and support  the  transition to a low-carbon economy, while making progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development  Goals and improving the representation of women and marginalized groups in sustainable infrastructure.\nOur commitment to multilateralism \u2014 notably United Nations peacekeeping \u2014 includes a commitment to renewal and reform and to making the system that our grandparents built fit for purpose in the twenty- first century. Canada is proud to have increased its contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations and to have adopted smart pledging \u2014 sending the people and equipment that are most needed to the places where they are most useful.\nCanada is spearheading the Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations \u2014 a practical plan to act on our shared promise to double the number of women in peacekeeping operations. We set that as  a  goal, first and foremost, because of our shared belief in the fundamental equal rights of women. We also know that having women in the ranks \u2014 and in charge \u2014 makes peacekeeping more effective and its results more durable. We look forward to working with our new partners, Ghana and Zambia, to better recruit, train, retain and promote women across all of  our  police and military forces. For the international rules-based order to work for all, the rules need to apply to all. Accountability cannot be a luxury afforded only when circumstances allow.\nAs is the case everywhere, Canada\u2019s actions in Myanmar, Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela are guided by an unequivocal commitment to protecting and promoting human rights. The crimes against humanity committed against the Rohingya of Myanmar, including the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war, are utterly unacceptable. Canada\u2019s Parliament unanimously adopted a motion naming those crimes genocide and urging the Security Council to refer those appalling acts to the International Criminal Court. The plight of the Rohingya people demands a response.\nCanada is appalled by the crimes that the Al-Assad regime in Syria has committed against its own people, including, most horrifically, the use of banned chemical weapons. Syrians  rightly  demand  accountability and hope for an enduring political solution. The\nWhite Helmets, many  of  whom  gathered  evidence of chemical-weapon attacks at the risk of their lives, rightly expect our support in seeking justice.\nIn Canada\u2019s own hemisphere, an Organization of American States panel of independent international experts carefully documented many of the crimes being committed in Venezuela by the Maduro regime against its own people. Here too, Venezuelans hope for accountability. For that reason, we and our regional partners took the exceptional step of referring that case to the International Criminal Court.\nThe ongoing illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea is a clear breach of international law. Respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity are not mere notions; they are the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We must not allow Russia to continue its destabilizing actions.\nOur determination to ensure that the perpetrators of those serious crimes in Myanmar, Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela are held accountable is accompanied  by a deep commitment to improve the humanitarian situation for the millions of people affected, both within those countries, as well as across those regions.\nWe recognize that the disproportionate share of the responsibility for providing lifesaving support to so many people has fallen on neighbouring countries, and we assure them that they can continue to rely on our assistance. We will continue to contribute to the work of the United Nations in addressing those challenges.\nWhen the international rules-based order was designed, the General Assembly mandated the Security Council to authorize the use of  force,  if  necessary,  to keep the peace and to keep us safe. Seventy years later, that remains its core responsibility. The Security Council\u2019s agenda is replete with persistent and emerging challenges. Some security threats we know all too well; others are emerging; and others still we have yet to anticipate. But all are systemic and require collective responses. Be they old or new, those threats will continue to test the Security Council\u2019s ability to adapt and respond. That is why Canada is seeking a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2021- 2022. We are confident that we can contribute to effective, carefully considered global responses.\n \nWe have a proven record of working with other Member States to bring fresh ideas and innovative approaches to the tackling of complex  problems, from peacekeeping and policing to peacebuilding and transitions. We are confident that we can harness the diversity of ideas and experience necessary to fashion forward-looking approaches that can work. After all, bringing people together is our calling card. A capacity for cooperation defines our national character. Inclusion is part of our identity.  When Canada has served on  the Security Council in the past, we have done so inclusively. We brought other States and civil society into the conversation. We championed  the  women  and peace and security agenda and human security. We fought for the protection of civilians caught in the crossfire of armed conflict.\nIf elected to the Security Council, we will bring to bear our long-standing dedication to peacekeeping, our more than 30 years of service as Chair of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, and our active membership in the Peacebuilding Commission. If elected, we will work with others to tackle climate change and violent extremism, and to promote economic security and the empowerment of women and girls. We will champion inclusion and accountability, openness and transparency in all of the Security Council\u2019s deliberations. We will help to find solutions so as to build a safer, fairer, and  more  secure  world  where the benefits of the international rules-based order are distributed more evenly. We are confident that the institutions that we have spent more than seven decades building can be renewed and revitalized. But we can do that effectively only if we do it together.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to congratulate Her Excellency Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We wish her every success. I also express our appreciation to His Excellency Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his valuable efforts during the seventy-second session. We pay tribute also to the relentless efforts of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to promote the role of the United Nations and achieve its lofty goals.\nI would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of Mr. Kofi Annan and to the United Nations on his passing. He was one of the most important symbols of the United Nations and a promoter of international cooperation, development and peace among nations.\nThe world faces serious security, political and economic threats and challenges that do not respect borders, which represents a real test for the collective security of the United Nations. If the international community wants to achieve international peace and security, we must go beyond crisis management and seek comprehensive and just solutions, in accordance with the provisions of international law and the resolutions of international legitimacy, while rejecting selectivity, double standards and policies of the imposition of force.\nWe recognize and appreciate the vital importance of having an international and comprehensive point of reference re\ufb02ected in a legitimate international order that respects the rule of law. We must expedite the reform process of United Nations institutions in order to enable the Organization to shoulder its responsibilities, achieve its lofty goals and respond to the aspirations of peoples. That would enable us to bring about peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, which is the theme\nthat the President of the General Assembly has chosen for this session.\nMore than a year after the illegal blockade imposed on the State of Qatar, many facts have been revealed about a pre-arranged campaign of incitement against it, as well as the insinuations and fabrications used to create the crisis. In the meantime, the international community also recognized the falseness of the allegations made against my country to justify the premeditated measures taken under the pretext of those fabricated and untrue allegations, in \ufb02agrant violation of international law and basic relations between nations, as well as the values and norms of our peoples.\nDespite all the measures taken to undermine Qatar\u2019s security and stability and to create hardship for its people, in addition to the economic warfare launched to hinder its development process, the period that followed that unjust siege has witnessed the strengthening of the status of the State of Qatar and the consolidation of its role as an active partner in the regional and international arenas. Moreover, the Qatari economy has continued to grow, proof of its vigour and consistency. The State of Qatar has also maintained its advanced and leading rankings compared with other countries of the region in global indicators, especially in the areas of human security and human development. That has strengthened the Qatari people\u2019s faith in their potential, values and principles and increased their cohesion and unity.\nBelieving in the soundness of our legal  position, in the need for the peaceful settlement of disputes and in dialogue as the best way to resolve crises, we have been, and remain, positively responsive to all the efforts of brotherly and friendly nations, which we appreciate, to end this crisis through unconditional dialogue, based on mutual respect for the sovereignty of nations.\nIt is not reasonable for differences of opinion on the handling of some regional issues to lead to paralysing the effectiveness of an important regional organization such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The blockade on Qatar has harmed the reputation of the GCC countries, and the paralysis of the GCC has reflected negatively on the role it aspires to play in dealing with regional and global issues. We hope that we will all be able to transform the current plight of the GCC into an opportunity for reform and to put forward binding mechanisms to resolve the differences among\n \nits States through dialogue, so as to avoid any similar recurrence in future.\nIt is not right that our Arab region remains hostage because of some marginal differences \u2014 fabricated,  in our case \u2014 which consume efforts and energy and waste more funds than we allocate to the just causes upon which we are supposed to agree.\nLittle progress has been made on the lingering Middle East issues, especially the Palestinian question, which represents the last vestiges of our world\u2019s colonial past. The political process that began 25 years ago was an example of a departure from United Nations terms of reference to frameworks outside the Organization, which were perceived by some as the best and fastest way to settle and find solutions to that question. That process was supported by the Arab States and respectful of the Palestinian decision, but it has resulted in further stalemate and complexity. We are now witnessing attempts to eliminate the Palestinian question by disregarding issues relating to a permanent solution, such as those of Jerusalem,  refugees,  sovereignty  and borders.\nJust national issues cannot be resolved by becoming entangled in the balance of power between the occupier and the occupied. Such issues can be resolved only in accordance with certain principles, such as the right  to self-determination and the inadmissibility of the annexation of territories of others by force, which have become part of international legitimacy.\nThe deterioration of the situation in the Palestinian territories, particularly the inhumane conditions  in the Gaza Strip, the suffocating siege to which it is subjected and the continued construction of settlements in occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank, are having grave consequences and place a historic responsibility on the Security Council. We reaffirm the importance of negotiations, whose resumption is vital and which will require a commitment to resolutions of international legitimacy, foremost among which are the two-State solution and the Arab Peace Initiative, based on East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State, along the 1967 borders. Moreover, there can be no solution to the Arab-Israeli con\ufb02ict without a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question.  We  abide  by  that position, which is consistent with international legitimacy and morally just. However, Israel rejects such a just settlement.\nThe State of Qatar will spare no effort in providing various forms of material and political support to the brotherly Palestinian people and in continuing to work with all international actors involved in the Middle East peace process so as to overcome the difficulties that are obstructing the resumption of peace negotiations, in accordance with the terms of reference and resolutions of international legitimacy.\nAfter more than seven years, the international community  remains  unable to  find  a  solution  to the worsening Syrian crisis  in  all  its  aspects  and  its dangerous consequences. The Syrian people, in addition to the tragedies they have experienced, are concerned and frustrated that the crimes of genocide, mass displacement and large-scale death in prisons, under torture, could become common practice and that the international community might get used to it.\nFailure to deter the Syrian regime from committing crimes by waging a  war against its own people, on  the one hand, and failure to hold it accountable after the commission of such crimes, on the other, would render the provisions of international law and human rights law devoid of meaning. That would have serious consequences for the prevailing values of our world,  as it would promote the use of violence as a means of suppressing peoples\u2019 aspirations and trampling on the rights of citizens and peoples of our region.\nWe are facing a humanitarian, moral and legal disaster that requires the international community to urgently reach a political solution that stops the Syrian bloodshed, fulfils Syrian aspirations to justice and freedom, maintains Syria\u2019s unity and sovereignty and achieves security and stability in Syria and the region, in accordance with the first Geneva communiqu\u00e9 (S/2012/522, annex) and the relevant Security Council resolutions. We emphasize the necessity of abiding by international humanitarian law and protecting civilians.\nRegarding the Yemeni issue, we underscore that the firm position of the State of Qatar is to remain committed to the unity, independence and territorial integrity of Yemen. We call upon all Yemeni  parties to achieve national reconciliation and end the con\ufb02ict, on the basis of Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), the Initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the outcomes of the national dialogue. From  this rostrum I appeal to States that are active in the international community to help the brotherly Yemeni people to overcome current conditions, which we hope will soon\n \nend, take all measures necessary to address the grave humanitarian situation and facilitate free access for humanitarian assistance to all areas of Yemen. In that regard, I wish to announce Qatar\u2019s agreement with the United Nations to fight cholera in Yemen by supporting projects related to combating the causes of the disease and to halting its spread. We call upon other countries to join us in supporting that vital effort.\nTurning to the Libyan crisis, which has recently witnessed developments that place the country\u2019s security and territorial integrity at risk, we look forward to the restoration of security and stability despite the tremendous challenges facing our Libyan  brothers. We note that foreign intervention in Libyan affairs further complicates the crisis, prevents the reaching  of the national consensus that is sought by our Libyan brothers and contravenes Security Council resolutions. We reiterate our support for the Skhirat Agreement, signed in December 2015, and all its outcomes. We  call upon all Libyan brothers to uphold the country\u2019s national interests and participate in a dialogue, without excluding any component of Libyan society, in order to reach a comprehensive political settlement that preserves Libya\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and realizes the aspirations of its people to security and stability.\nTurning to brotherly Iraq, we once again express our appreciation for the efforts of the Iraqi Government in restoring stability and achieving national reconciliation by cooperating with all political parties and components of the Iraqi society. We value the successes and sacrifices of the Iraqi people in the fight against terrorism and extremism in all its forms. We reaffirm our commitment to supporting brotherly Iraq in the process of its reconstruction and development and assisting in every effort to seek to ensure its unity and sovereignty and enhance its security and stability.\nThere is consensus that terrorism  has  become one of the most persistent challenges facing the world because of the real threat it poses to international peace and security. We underline the firm position of the State of Qatar in rejecting terrorism in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world, regardless of reason or pretext. The fight against terrorism is a priority of the State of Qatar\u2019s policy at the national, regional and international levels. We have developed legislative and institutional systems, fulfilled our international obligations related to the fight against terrorism and its\nfinancing, and participated in all relevant international\nand regional efforts.\nIn our view, the following prerequisites are necessary to ensure that the war on terrorism achieves its goal and does not turn into a self-contained struggle. First, we need international cooperation in combating violence resulting from extremism and violence directed against civilians as a form of terror and aimed at damaging civilian facilities for political ends. Those phenomena must be  addressed  firmly and rigorously. Secondly, we must unify standards for fighting terrorism so that its definition is not selective and does not depend on the religious or ethnic identity of the perpetrator. Thirdly, we must address its root causes and research the political, social and cultural backgrounds that contribute to fuelling it while working earnestly to achieve the just settlement of outstanding issues that give rise to anger and frustration. Fourthly, we must avoid giving any partisan connotation to the term \u201cterrorism\u201d by tailoring it to fit into the narrow interests of some nations and using it to justify tyranny and the repression of political opponents, which affects the credibility of the combat against terrorism and undermines the international efforts made in that field.\nWith that in mind, the State of  Qatar  believes that educating young people and ensuring their comprehensive participation represents the first line of defence for the collective security system, as they are an important factor in fighting terrorism and building peace and stability. We have therefore committed to educating 10 million children and providing economic support to half a million young people in our region. In collaboration with the United Nations, we have carried out projects to promote  employment  opportunities  for young people through capacity-building and have launched programmes to prevent violent extremism.\nHuman development and the protection and promotion of human rights are at the forefront of our priorities. The State of Qatar is  pursuing efforts at  the legislative and institutional levels  to implement its 2030 national vision, which emphasizes human development. This month, the State of Qatar acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The State of Qatar recently enacted a law regulating the issue of political asylum in the country, following the steps of developed countries, and another law granting the right to permanent residence in the State under conditions prescribed by\n \nlaw. It has also decided to invite several international human rights organizations to establish regional offices in our country.\nNo one doubts the importance of the development of information and digital technology and digital means of communication. The economy and day- to-day life would be inconceivable without them. However, a series of recent events in several countries have reminded us that new needs are emerging, such as the need for freedom of access and the need to protect the private lives of citizens from the risk of hacking. It also alerted us to the cybersecurity of nations, which is a cross-border issue because of the nature of the technology itself.\nAccordingly, we must regulate how those issues are dealt with and control their risks internationally. Qatar and other countries have suffered from digital piracy and digital espionage,  which  has  prompted  us to strongly emphasize the  issue.  We  are willing  to work with United Nations bodies to devise legal regulations. In that regard, we propose the convening of an international conference to examine means of regulation in that area by international law, and we express our readiness to host such a conference.\n"

        "file_text": "One year ago, I stood before the Assembly for the first time in this Hall (see A/72/ PV.3). I  addressed the  threats facing our world,  and  I presented a vision to achieve  a  brighter future for all of humankind. Today, I stand before the General Assembly to share the extraordinary progress that we have made. In less than two years, my Administration has accomplished more than almost any Administration in the history of our country.\nAmerica\u2019s economy is booming like never before. Since my election, we have added $10 trillion in wealth. The stock market is  at  an all-time high in history, and jobless claims are at a 50-year low. African- American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. We have added more than 4 million new jobs, including half a million manufacturing jobs. We passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. We started the construction of a major border wall and we have greatly strengthened border security. We have secured record funding for our military \u2014 $700 billion this year and $716 billion next year. Our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before.\nIn other words, the United States is a stronger, safer and richer country than it was when I assumed office less than two years ago. We are standing up for America and for the American people. We are also standing up for the world. This is great news for our citizens and for peace-loving people everywhere. We believe that, when nations respect the rights of their neighbours and defend the interests of their people, they can better work together to secure the blessings of safety, prosperity and peace.\nEach of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture, a rich history and a  people  bound  together by ties of memory, tradition and the values that make our homelands like nowhere else on Earth. That  is why America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control and domination. I honour the right of every nation in this Hall to pursue its own customs, beliefs and traditions. The United States will not tell nations how to live or work or worship. We only ask that you honour our sovereignty in return.\nFrom Warsaw to Brussels and from Tokyo to Singapore, it has been my highest honour to represent the United States abroad. I have forged close relationships and friendships and strong partnerships\n \nwith the leaders of many nations in this Hall, and our approach has always yielded incredible change.\nWith support from many countries here today, we have engaged with North Korea to replace the spectre of conflict with a bold and new push for peace. In June, I travelled to Singapore to meet face to face with North Korea\u2019s leader, Chairman Kim Jong Un. We had highly productive conversations and meetings. And we agreed that it was in both countries\u2019 interests to pursue the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Since that meeting, we have already seen a number of encouraging measures that few could have imagined only a short time ago.\nMissiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction, nuclear testing has stopped and some military facilities are already being dismantled. Our hostages have been released and, as promised, the remains of our fallen heroes are being returned home to lay at rest in American soil. I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done. The sanctions will stay in place until denuclearization occurs.\nI also want to thank the many  Member  States who helped us reach this moment \u2014 which is in fact far greater than people might understand \u2014 for their critical support, which we will all need going forward. I would also like to extend special thanks to President Moon of South Korea, Prime Minister Abe of Japan and President Xi of China.\nIn the Middle East, our new approach is also yielding great strides and historic change. Following my trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Gulf countries opened a new centre to target terrorist  financing. They are enforcing new sanctions, working with us to identify and track terrorist networks and taking more responsibility for fighting terrorism and extremism in their own region.\nThe United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have pledged billions of dollars to aid the people of Syria and Yemen. They are pursuing multiple avenues to end Yemen\u2019s horrible, horrific civil war. Ultimately, it is up to the nations of the region to decide what kind of future they want for themselves and their children.\nFor that reason, the United States is working with the Gulf Cooperation Council, Jordan and Egypt to establish a regional strategic alliance so that MiddleEastern nations can advance prosperity, stability and security across their home region.\nThanks to the United States military and our partnership with many nations, I am pleased to report that the bloodthirsty killers known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham have been driven out from the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria. We will continue to work with friends and allies to deny radical Islamic terrorists any funding, territory or support or any means of infiltrating our borders.\nThe ongoing tragedy in Syria is heartbreaking. Our shared goals must be the de-escalation of military conflict, along with a political solution that honours the will of the Syrian people. In this vein, we urge that the United Nations-led peace process be reinvigorated. Rest assured, the United States will respond if chemical weapons are deployed by the Al-Assad regime.\nI commend the people of Jordan and other neighbouring countries for hosting refugees  from  this brutal civil war. As we see in Jordan, the most compassionate policy is to place refugees as close to their homes as possible to ease their eventual return as part of the rebuilding process. This approach also stretches finite resources to help far more people, increasing the impact of every dollar spent.\nEvery solution to the humanitarian crisis in Syria must also include a strategy to address the brutal regime that has fuelled and financed it: the corrupt dictatorship in Iran. Iran\u2019s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction. They do not  respect their neighbours or  borders or  the sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran\u2019s leaders plunder the nation\u2019s resources to enrich themselves and spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. The Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran\u2019s treasury, seized valuable portions of the economy and looted the people\u2019s religious endowments \u2014 all to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war. Not good.\nIran\u2019s neighbours have paid a heavy toll for the regime\u2019s agenda of aggression and expansion. That is why so many countries in the Middle East strongly supported my decision to withdraw the United States from the horrible 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose nuclear sanctions. The Iran deal was a windfall for Iran\u2019s leaders. In the years since the deal was reached, Iran\u2019s military budget grew nearly 40 per cent. The dictatorship used the funds to build nuclear-capable\n \nmissiles, increase internal repression, finance terrorism and fund havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen.\nThe United States has launched a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime the funds it needs to advance its bloody agenda. Last month, we began reimposing hard-hitting nuclear sanctions that had been lifted under the Iran deal. Additional sanctions will resume 5 November, and more will follow. And we are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially. We cannot allow the world\u2019s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet\u2019s most dangerous weapons. We cannot allow a regime that chants \u201cDeath to America\u201d and threatens Israel with annihilation to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on Earth. We just cannot do it. We ask all nations to isolate Iran\u2019s regime as long as its aggression continues. And we ask all nations to support Iran\u2019s people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and righteous destiny.\nThis year, we also took another significant step forward in the Middle East. In recognition of every sovereign State\u2019s right to determine its own capital, I moved the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The United States is committed to a future of peace and stability in the region, including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. That aim is advanced, not harmed, by acknowledging the obvious facts. America\u2019s policy of principled realism means we will not be held hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies and so- called experts who have been proven wrong over the years, time and time again. That is true not only in matters of peace, but in matters of prosperity.\nWe believe that trade must be fair and reciprocal. The United States will not be taken advantage of any longer. For decades, the United States opened its economy \u2014 the largest, by far, on Earth \u2014 with few conditions. We allowed foreign goods from all over the world to flow freely across our borders. Yet other countries did not grant us fair and reciprocal  access to  their markets  in return. Even worse, some countries abused their openness to dump their products, subsidize their goods, target our industries and manipulate their currencies to gain unfair advantage over our country. As a result, our trade deficit ballooned to nearly $800 billion a year. For that reason, we are systematically renegotiating broken and bad trade deals.\nLast month, we announced a ground-breaking United States-Mexico trade agreement. And just yesterday, I\nstood with President Moon to announce the successful completion of the brand new United States-Korea trade deal. And that is just the beginning. Many nations in this Hall will agree that the world trading system is in dire need of change. For example, countries were admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that violate every single principle on which the organization is based. While the United States and many other nations play by the rules, those countries use Government-run industrial planning and State-owned enterprises to rig the system in their favour. They engage in relentless product dumping, forced technology transfer and the theft of intellectual property.\nThe United States lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs, nearly a quarter of all steel jobs and 60,000 factories after China joined the  WTO. And we have racked up $13 trillion in trade deficits over the past two decades. But those days are over. We will no longer tolerate such abuse. We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated and our wealth to be plundered and transferred. America will never apologize for protecting its citizens. The United States has just announced tariffs on another\n$200 billion in Chinese-made goods \u2014 for a total, so far, of $250 billion. I have great respect and affection for my friend President Xi, but I have made it clear that our trade imbalance is just not acceptable. China\u2019s market distortions and the way they deal cannot be tolerated. As my Administration has demonstrated, America will always act in our national interests.\nI spoke before this body last year (see A/72/PV.3) and warned that the Human Rights Council had become a grave embarrassment to this institution, shielding egregious human rights abusers while bashing America and its many friends. Our Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, laid out a clear agenda for reform, but despite reported and repeated warnings,  no action at all was taken. The United States took the only responsible course. We withdrew from the Human Rights Council, and we will not return until real reform is enacted. For similar reasons, the United States will provide no support or recognition to the International Criminal Court (ICC). As far as America is concerned, the ICC has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority. The ICC claims near-universal jurisdiction over the citizens of every country, violating all principles of justice, fairness and due process. We will never surrender America\u2019s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable global bureaucracy. America is governed\n \nby Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism. Around the world, responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance, but also from other new forms of coercion and domination.\nIn America, we believe strongly in energy security for ourselves and for our allies. We have become the largest energy producer anywhere on the face of the Earth. The United States stands ready to export our abundant, affordable supply of oil, clean coal and natural gas. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and OPEC nations, are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I do not like it. Nobody should like it. We defend many of those nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good. We want them to stop raising prices. We want them to start lowering prices. And they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on. We are not going to put up with such horrible prices much longer. Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation. That is why we congratulate European States, such as Poland, for leading the construction of a Baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their energy needs. Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change its course.\nHere, in the western hemisphere, we are committed to maintaining our independence from the encroachment of expansionist foreign powers. It has been the formal policy of our country since President Monroe to reject the interference of foreign nations in this hemisphere and in our own affairs.\nThe United States recently strengthened our laws to better screen foreign investments in our country for national security threats, and we welcome cooperation with countries in the region and around  the  world that wish to do the same. You need to do it for your own protection.\nThe United States is also working with partners in Latin America to confront threats to sovereignty from uncontrolled migration. Tolerance of human smuggling and trafficking is not humane. It is horrible thing that is going on, at levels that nobody has ever seen before. It is very cruel. Illegal immigration funds criminal networks, ruthless gangs and the flow of deadly drugs. Illegal immigration exploits vulnerable populations, hurts hard-working citizens and has produced a vicious\ncycle of crime, violence and poverty. Only by upholding national borders and destroying criminal gangs  can we break that cycle and establish a  real foundation  for prosperity.\nWe recognize the right of every nation in this Hall to set its own immigration policy in accordance with its national interests, just as we  ask other countries   to respect our own right to  do  the  same \u2014  which  we are doing. That is one reason the United States  will not participate in the new global compact for migration. Migration should not be governed by an international body that is unaccountable to our own citizens. Ultimately, the only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to help people build more hopeful futures in their home countries, to make their countries great again.\nCurrently, we are witnessing a human tragedy, to give an example, in Venezuela. More than 2 million people have fled the anguish inflicted by the socialist Maduro regime and its Cuban sponsors. Not long ago, Venezuela was one of the richest countries on Earth. Today socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty. Almost everywhere socialism or communism has been tried, it has produced suffering, corruption and decay.\nSocialism\u2019s thirst for power leads to expansion, incursion and oppression. All nations of the world should resist socialism and the misery that it  brings  to everyone. In that spirit, we ask the nations that are gathered here to join us in calling for the restoration  of democracy in Venezuela. Today we are announcing additional sanctions against the repressive regime, targeting Maduro\u2019s inner circle and close advisers.\nWe are grateful for all the work the United Nations does around the world to help people build better lives for  themselves and their families. The United States  is by far the world\u2019s largest giver of foreign aid, but few give anything to us. That is why we are taking a hard look at United States foreign assistance. That will be headed up by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We will examine what is working, what is not working  and whether the countries that receive our dollars and our protection also have our interests at heart. Moving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those that respect us and, frankly, are our friends. We expect other countries to pay their fair share of the cost of their defence.\n \nThe United States is committed to making the United Nations more effective and accountable. I have said many times that the United Nations has unlimited potential. As part of our reform effort, I have told our negotiators that the United States will not pay more than 25 per cent of the United Nations peacekeeping budget. That will encourage other countries to step up, get involved and share the very large burden. We are working to shift more of  our funding from assessed  to voluntary contributions, so that we can target American resources to the programmes with the best record of success. Only when each of us does its part and contributes its share can we realize the highest aspirations of the United Nations.\nWe must pursue peace without fear, hope without despair and security without apology. Looking around this Hall, where so much history has transpired, we think of the many before us who have come here to address the challenges of their nations and times. Our thoughts turn to the same question that ran through all their speeches and resolutions, through every word and every hope. It is a question of what kind of world we will leave for our children and what kind of nations they will inherit. The dreams that fill this Hall today are as diverse as the people that have stood at this rostrum, and as varied as the countries represented here in this body. It really is something. It really is great history.\nThere  is  India,  a  free  society  with  more  than 1 billion people, successfully lifting countless millions out of poverty and into the middle class. There is Saudi Arabia, where King Salman and the Crown Prince are pursuing bold new reforms. There is Israel, proudly celebrating its seventieth anniversary as a thriving democracy in the holy land. In Poland, a great people are standing up for their independence, security and sovereignty. Many countries are pursuing their own unique visions, building their own hopeful futures and chasing their own wonderful dreams of destiny, legacy and a home. The whole world is richer and humanity is better because of this beautiful constellation of nations, each very special, each very unique and each shining brightly in its part of the world. In each one, we see the awesome promise of a people bound together by a shared past and working towards a common future.\nAs for Americans, we know what kind of future we want for ourselves. We know what kind of nation America must always be. In America we believe in the majesty of freedom and the dignity of the individual. We believe in self-government and the rule of law. And we prize\nthe culture that sustains our liberty \u2014 a culture built on strong families, deep faith and fierce independence. We celebrate our heroes, we treasure our traditions and, above all, we love our country.\nInside everyone in this great Hall today, and everyone listening around the globe, there is the heart of a patriot that feels the same powerful love for your nation and the same intense loyalty to your homeland. The passion that burns in the hearts of patriots and the souls of nations has inspired reform and revolution, sacrifice and selflessness, scientific breakthroughs and magnificent works of art. Our task is not to erase it, but to embrace it \u2014 to build with it, to draw on its ancient wisdom and to find within it the will to make our nations greater, our regions safer and the world better.\nTo unleash that incredible potential in our people, we must defend the foundations that make it all possible. Sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicles where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured and peace has ever prospered. And so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all. When we do, we will find new avenues for cooperation unfolding before us. We will find a new passion for peacemaking rising within us. We will find new purpose, new resolve and new spirit flourishing all around us and making this a more beautiful world in which to live.\nTogether let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity and pride. Let us choose peace and freedom over domination and defeat. Let us  come here to this place to stand up for our people and their nations \u2014 forever strong, forever sovereign, forever just and forever thankful for the grace, goodness and glory of God. God bless you and God bless the nations of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to address the General Assembly for the first time as President of the Republic of South Africa.\nIt is nearly a quarter of a century since the founding father of our democracy, President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, stood at this rostrum to declare that\n\u201cThe millions across our globe who stand expectant at the gates of hope look to this Organization to bring them peace, to bring them\nlife, to bring them a life worth living.\u201d (A/49/PV.14, p. 10)\nAs we mark the centenary of the birth of this great global leader, Nelson Mandela, we are bound to ask whether the United Nations has met the needs and expectations of the millions who stand at the gates of hope. We are bound to ask what contribution the United Nations has made to a more peaceful, more prosperous and more equal world. More important, we are called upon to ask \u2014 as we did yesterday during the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit (see A/73/PV.5), which was held here \u2014 what the United Nations and the assembled global leadership must do to secure lasting peace, reconciliation and stability across the globe.\nAllow me to express the deep gratitude of the Government and the people of South Africa to the international community for convening the Peace Summit to honour the memory of Nelson Mandela and advance his legacy. We applaud the political declaration of the Summit (resolution 73/1), which recognizes the period from 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace. It reflects a new and sincere commitment by the world\u2019s leaders to comprehensively advance peace and security and resolve all conflicts and wars. To succeed in giving effect to that commitment, the United Nations must become what billions of people across the world want it to be, that is, a representative and truly democratic global parliament of the people of the world.\nThroughout its seven decades, the United Nations has been a source of hope for the oppressed, exploited and poor around the world. During the dark days of colonialism and apartheid, we drew strength, inspiration and encouragement from the United Nations and its Charter in our quest for freedom and self-determination. With the support of the United Nations, 24 years ago, we as South Africans were able to  bring an  end  to the nightmare of apartheid. Nelson Mandela led us to freedom and gave us the great opportunity to transform our country. We have now embarked upon a journey of transformation and are making progress to deal with the ugly legacy of the past system of apartheid.\nMadiba\u2019s vision continues to guide us as we seek to improve the lives of our people in many respects, among others, by improving educational outcomes for our youth and transforming our economy, which was constituted to serve the interests of a few. We have started a comprehensive dialogue on the question of land reform in our country, which is guided by our\n \nConstitution and the rule of law, as we seek ways to ensure that the land is shared among all who work it, as set out in our Freedom Charter. Even as our country is experiencing difficult economic challenges, we  have made progress. We are reforming our economy and creating an environment that is conducive to investment and have embarked upon an investment drive to attract $100 billion in the next five years. To the poor, vulnerable and marginalized, the United Nations today is a beacon of promise in a landscape of doubt. To billions across the world, the United Nations is the most powerful instrument we possess to achieve a more equal, humane and inclusive world.\nThere are men and women with dreams and aspirations that transcend the hardships of the present, who want to contribute to a new global civilization defined by care, justice and solidarity. They want an end to the greed, ignorance and conceit that is driving the destruction of our only home, the Earth. It is within our ability, as the leaders assembled here today, to forge a more representative, equal and fair United Nations that is empowered and equipped to lead the struggle to end poverty, unemployment and inequality in the world.\nWe are a youthful world: more than half the global population is under the age of 30. That is even more pronounced on our continent of Africa, where two thirds of our people were not yet born when Nelson Mandela was released from 27 years in prison. We are living in the age of youth. That places a responsibility on us as leaders not only to put the interests of young people at the centre of our efforts, but also to empower women and young people to be more prominent in directing the course of global affairs. It is young people who are fighting the wars that we started. It is women who are bearing the brunt and hardships of the wars that continue to destroy their lives and their families. As we speak, young lives are being lost and futures are being destroyed.\nThere is an urgency to the measures we must take to end conflict and war. Not only must we stop the death, destruction and human suffering that is visited daily on millions of people, but we  must act with purpose  to prevent the loss of another entire generation to its aftermath. We must accept our shared responsibility for, and our shared interests in, ending conflict and using the outcomes of the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit to empower the United Nations to be a more effective instrument for mediation, peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction.\nOur resolve to end ongoing conflicts and our determination to root out terrorism must be matched by action and the appropriate deployment of resources. We must act with the same urgency to resolve some of the world\u2019s most protracted and intractable disputes. The fact that the people of Palestine have endured occupation and suffering for nearly as long as the United Nations has existed makes their plight no less pressing and their suffering no more acceptable. We must likewise intensify our efforts to secure the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and full national sovereignty.\nOne of the greatest challenges to the achievement of global prosperity and development is the continued exclusion of millions of women and young people from meaningful economic participation. It is therefore vital that we deploy all the means at our disposal to address youth unemployment and ensure universal access to educational opportunities appropriate to the changing world of work. We need a deliberate programme to ensure that the digital revolution, which carries such great potential for both disruption and empowerment, is effectively harnessed to promote social justice as well as human progress. The call to leave no one behind requires that we strengthen the institutions of global governance and make them more responsive to the needs of young people, particularly in the developing world.\nInstitutions such as the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization need to be reshaped and enhanced so that they may more effectively meet the challenges of the contemporary world and better serve the interests of the poor and marginalized around the globe. Reform of the United Nations, and of the Security Council in particular, must be a priority if we are to give full effect to the values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe must resist any and all efforts to undermine the multilateral approach to international trade, which is essential to the promotion of stability and predictability in the global economy. The history of the global economy informs us that no country can prosper at the expense of all others and that no people can hope to live in comfort and security as long as millions of others languish in poverty.\nIt is therefore essential that we take collective responsibility for the development of all nations and for the improvement of the lives of all people. That\n \nresponsibility is manifest in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, among other agreements. Together they represent our common commitment to tackle poverty, underdevelopment and environmental degradation. They represent our common commitment to tackle diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, diabetes and cancer. Our task as global leaders is to pursue the policies required to turn intent into implementation and mobilize the resources needed to turn implementation into impact.\nWe have made significant strides as Africans in addressing the challenges that have confronted our continent for many decades. We continue vigorously to implement our commitments set out in the African Union Agenda 2063, which is our collective plan as Africans to rid our continent of under-development,  poverty and conflict and to improve democratic governance, the rule of law and the promotion of human rights. We have recently reached agreement on the establishment of an African Continental Free Trade Area, which will fundamentally transform African economies, giving rise to a new industrial age on the continent. We are working to silence the guns in Africa by 2020, to bring an end to conflicts that have cost the lives of millions of our people, displaced more and stunted economic growth and human development.\nAs the continent  with  the  youngest  population in the world, Africa has the potential to be the next great frontier for global growth and development. With effective investment in education, improved health care, good governance and greater economic integration, Africa has the potential to develop its productive capacity on a scale and at a rate that will lift tens of millions out of poverty. The youth of Africa are poised to transform their continent.\nWe the people of South Africa are committed to being part of that transformation. From the ashes of a system that was described by the General Assembly as a crime against humanity, we are building a new, democratic nation, united in its diversity. We are working to correct the injustices of our past and to build a society that is free, inclusive and sustainable. We are pursuing an economic path that draws on the resources and capabilities of all our people to eradicate poverty, unemployment and inequality. We are determined through our international relations to be a force for progress, good, peace and global equality, and\nwill continue to advance the interests of the African continent and the global South.\nAllow me to conclude by once more drawing on the wisdom of Nelson Mandela, who said, \u201cSometimes it falls on a generation to be great.\u201d This is not the generation that will stand expectant at the gates of hope; this is the generation that will change the world. It is the generation of young people who want to see change. This is their time and this is their age. Let their greatness blossom.\n"

        "file_text": "As  I  am participating in the opening  of  this  session  of the General Assembly, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to preside over this world forum as the first Latin American woman and the fourth woman in history to hold the position. I wish her success and have no doubt that she will do an excellent job throughout this session.\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Guatemala, I would like to thank the international community and the various humanitarian assistance organizations for their solidarity and support in the face of the tragedy that occurred in my country on 3 June as a result of the volcanic eruption that caused irreparable human losses, hundreds of injuries, extensive material damage and resulted in more than 1.7 million victims.\nToday we have the opportunity to reflect on the role played by the United Nations in the world order, respecting the sovereignty of the countries that make  it up, and I am more than ever convinced that our task is no greater than our forces. Behind me is a symbol that in this era, in which we find so  many barriers and differences, we can associate with peace and cooperation, and see as a meeting point for dialogue, tolerance and respect. At the same time, I represent Guatemala, a country with strong traditions and a people that believes in God, that loves and respects the family as the basis of society, that sees life as starting at conception, and that is dedicated to freedom and the construction of a peaceful society. One example of this view of our country and of our search for permanent peace is Guatemala\u2019s iron determination to resolve peacefully and definitively the territorial, insular and\n \nmaritime dispute that we have had with Belize for more than a century and a half.\nI am pleased to share with the Assembly that, on 15 April, a referendum was held in Guatemala on the question of submitting this case to the International Court of Justice, resulting in a resounding \u201cyes\u201d. Ninety-six per cent of voters voted in favour in the most participatory referendum in the country\u2019s history. We are convinced that the resolution of this dispute will bring economic, social and political benefits to both countries. We therefore also welcome the decision of the Government of Belize to set the date of 10 April 2019 for its own referendum, and we look forward to the results with great enthusiasm.\nThe pursuit of development in the region also leads to peace and prosperity. We can share with joy that Central American economic integration continues to grow in strength and make progress after half a century. This year, we took a historic step with the establishment of a customs union between Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. For Central America, this customs union means that 80 per cent of bilateral trade will enjoy the free transit of goods, thanks to tariff harmonization. Similarly, the cost of moving goods has been reduced by between 21 and 25 per cent, boosting exports and generating an increase in our countries\u2019 gross domestic product and improving tax collection and our companies\u2019 competitiveness. According to data from the World Bank, transit across our borders has been reduced from between six and 55 hours to 15 minutes. This customs union turns the three Central American countries into a market of 32 million people.\nGuatemala\u2019s efforts to combat transnational threats are unprecedented in the region. The determination and commitment of the Guatemalan security forces have enabled us to eradicate more than 471 million poppy plants, worth $1.4 billion, over the past two years, with the cooperation of United States agencies. We have seized 34,000 kilos of cocaine and increased heroin seizures by 400 per cent over previous years. This means that in two years we have seized more drugs than in the previous eight years combined, preventing more than 30 million United States and European citizens from being affected by the consumption of these drugs.\nGuatemala has made important advances in the areas of transparency and the fight against corruption. Our Open Government initiative and mechanism are working on the basis of our third national action plan, for\nthe period from 2016 to 2018, which has fulfilled 87 per cent of its commitments in the areas of access to public information, fiscal transparency, civic participation, technological innovation and accountability.\nGuatemala  has  worked  hard  to  comply  with the international  standards  of  the  Global  Forum  on Transparency and Exchange of Information for  Tax Purposes, and has ratified the Convention on Mutual Administrative  Assistance  in  Tax  Matters  of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These efforts have enabled us to be removed from the list of countries considered to be tax havens. In the same vein, the General Secretariat of the Presidency  of  the  Republic  of  Guatemala  has received ISO 9001:2015 certification for the quality of its management, and it recently  received ISO 37001:2016 certification for its anti-bribery management system, the only such  certification  in the world. The management system helps institutions to improve their overall performance and provide a solid basis  for  sustainable  development  initiatives.  It is also a tool for nurturing integrity, transparency, honesty and compliance with standards that minimize the risk of bribery by complying with legal obligations. In addition, 16 years after the last census, we carried out a national population and housing census this year with   state-of-the-art   digital   cartography,  reaching\n96 per cent of households, which will contribute to\nquality statistical information that will be vital for the evaluation and measurement of our public policies.\nI will now address the issues of security and justice, because my Government has been and always will be respectful of the law and the rule of law. With my head held high, I can say that there is no sign of corruption in the management of our Government. On the contrary, as President of the Republic, I have led the fight against corruption and efforts to increase governmental transparency and accountability. Proof of this is that we have taken important steps with the OECD to improve good practices in favour of governmental transparency.\nIn line with the foregoing, we believe it necessary to respect the sovereignty of each country and to guarantee full freedom and recognize the beliefs, values and principles of each State, and not to impose a global bureaucratic agenda that dictates how that bureaucracy thinks things should be.\nAfter almost four decades of internal armed conflict, Guatemalans signed a strong and lasting\n \npeace, and we have undertaken the very arduous and difficult task of building and maintaining it. Building peace is no easy task, as the grave consequences of the armed conflict weakened our institutions. Guatemala is the only State to have signed a cooperation agreement with the United Nations Secretariat establishing an international commission against impunity,  known  as the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which was originally to last for two years. In weighing the initiative\u2019s value, the State of Guatemala decided to extend that period five times. Under the direction of three Commissioners, the CICIG had its high and low points, and as a sovereign State Guatemala decided not to request a sixth extension, as we believe that more than a decade has provided it with enough time to fulfil its mandate. At the same time, we have asked the Secretary-General to begin transferring capacities to those Guatemala institutions responsible for ensuring justice, in accordance with the mandate.\nThe State of Guatemala is grateful for the technical support provided by CICIG in strengthening its democratic institutions, and we appreciate its contributions to fostering a culture of transparency and combating impunity and, especially, corruption. We are also grateful to the  international community for its financial support in sustaining CICIG throughout these years. For the sake of transparency, it would be very fitting for the Secretary-General to report on the details of the use of resources since the establishment of the Commission so as to inform the international community on the allocation of the approved funds. Given the circumstances, it is essential to familiarize the international community with the reasons why it was decided not to extend CICIG\u2019s mandate.\nFirst, it violated the political Constitution of the Republic, our laws and the very agreement on which its establishment was based, while overreaching the limits of its mandate, manipulating justice and undermining the presumption of innocence and due process. Secondly, Commissioner Vel\u00e1squez meddled in the country\u2019s internal affairs, while politicizing justice and judicializing politics; those abuses have polarized Guatemalan society and led to an environment of instability jeopardizing national security. In recent years, increasing doubts have been raised about CICIG at the national and international levels and, to our astonishment, a case involving the persecution of a Russian family, the Bitkovs, became known throughout the world. The United States Helsinki Commission has\nrequested CICIG to provide it with information on that matter, and the  Commission has repeatedly refused  to do so. That refusal to demonstrate accountability entirely contradicts the spirit of the Commission\u2019s fight against impunity.\nI reiterate my country\u2019s astonishment that despite the fact that the Guatemalan Government expressed  its concerns about CICIG abuses, it took a case affecting international interests to get the international community to understand the  injustices  committed by that United Nations Commission. In that regard, I want to point to the indifference and passivity of the Secretary-General, whom I personally and officially informed for more than a year of the concerns of the Government of Guatemala about the bad practices of CICIG and its Commissioner. I want to make it clear that I will not defend those who are corrupt or advocate for anyone involved in a judicial process pitted against the Guatemalan justice system. At the same time, however, no one can deny that, just like the Bitkovs, many Guatemalan people and families have also suffered illegal persecutions and violations of their human rights and constitutional guarantees at the hands of the Commission, which has enjoyed total impunity.\nHow is it  that the principles of  the presumption  of innocence  and  due  process  have  been  violated by CICIG in Guatemala? Contrary to the guidelines for international human rights instruments and the Guatemalan constitutional order, the Commission\u2019s statements always began with press conferences, mediating cases in violation of the presumption of innocence, because through such mediation pressure was exerted on judges and magistrates with regard to their decisions. The statement made by the jurist who heads the Commission \u2014 to the effect that persons become less innocent as investigations and the criminal process move forward \u2014 violates the political Constitution of our Republic, which guarantees the human right to the presumption of innocence. A person remains innocent until a final finding of guilt is handed down.\nWe would be remiss if we did not mention another abuse, which is the occurrences involving the excessive use of force and abuse of power that have become popularly known as \u201cCICIG black Thursdays\u201d, which, in addition to the aforementioned press conferences, include arrests and raids characterized by the use of excessive force accompanied by the presence of dozens of heavily armed police with high-calibre rifles. In that regard, Guatemala was astonished by one such\n \nraid, on 2 November 2016, which involved illegal entry into the presidential residence. This abuse was deplorable because, in addition to breaking through the three security perimeters of the presidential residence, the very institutional integrity of our country was jeopardized. CICIG personnel and United Nations vehicles took part in that raid.\nThose facts were included in a document addressing the concerns of the State of Guatemala delivered personally to the Secretary-General more than a year ago. The fact that CICIG has made the excessive use  of pretrial detention the rule in Guatemala, when it should be used only in exceptional circumstances, must also be addressed. Under the laws of Guatemala, no one must remain in pretrial custody for more than three months, but in cases involving CICIG, some were held on remand for more than three years and remained incarcerated for an additional five years as the judicial process unfolded, only to be found innocent later.\nTo date, hundreds of people have remained in years- long pretrial custody. In one such case, the so-called Peacock case, one person was tried in Guatemala, another in Austria and yet another in Spain. In all three countries, the evidence presented by CICIG was judged insufficient, and they were found not guilty. Today we mourn five deaths caused by the abuse of pretrial detention, in which pressure from CICIG on judges led them to fail to provide alternative forms of incarceration that would have ensured the delivery of adequate medical treatment. I call attention to the fact that such inhumane treatment has not been meted out to even the most dangerous criminals or drug traffickers.\nAnother case that I would like to bring up is that of Alfredo Zimeri, a young man of 19 years of age, who was brutally beaten by members of the CICIG staff, causing multiple and serious fractures to his face and skull. Mr. Vel\u00e1squez exceeded the authority of his mandate, in addition to finding himself in a conflict of interest, when he requested recorded footage from the surveillance cameras, which is evidence that only the public prosecutor is authorized to handle. Should this be described as justice or as impunity?\nEssentially, CICIG has  become  a  threat  to peace in Guatemala. It has set up a system of terror whereby anyone who thinks differently is tracked down, investigated and accused by or referred to the Commission so as to coerce witnesses, whom it later turns into effective collaborators by offering them\nsummary trials and reduced sentences. Unfortunately, the CICIG ideal has been lost in the bureaucracy of  the United Nations and in the cult of the individual, which as a matter of principle should never be greater than the institution it represents. What is certain is that today Guatemala is more polarized than it has been for decades. Some say that we did not have this kind of polarization even during the armed conflict in Guatemala in the 1980s. Groups of people with extremist views have sought to take advantage of the fight against corruption, applauding selective persecutions that have been turned into overt demonstrations by an ideologically biased CICIG. We in Guatemala do not want more confrontation, we want peace and justice. With the same respect that we have always shown, I am publicly asking the Secretary-General, before the Assembly, if we can agree on appointing a new CICIG Commissioner to carry out the transfer of technical capabilities to the appropriate bodies. Guatemala has acted in good faith at all times and we continue to believe firmly that disputes can be resolved amicably through dialogue.\nTurning to other subjects, we should point out Guatemala is a country located in a vulnerable tropical zone that is suffering increasingly seriously from the effects of climate change. We are once again dealing with a prolonged drought affecting the most vulnerable sectors of our population. That is why we have invested in rehabilitating all of our irrigation and mini-irrigation systems, which can help to ensure low-income farmers\u2019 production. We have focused our public investment budget on our national development priorities and have also been able to contribute to global environmental efforts by designing a technology called bio-fences for decontaminating rivers, beaches, seas and oceans that has been recognized by the World Economic Forum. We continue to work to combat chronic malnutrition through our 2016-2020 national strategy and policy for the prevention of chronic malnutrition, which is directly related to the Sustainable Development Goals aimed  at ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and ensuring quality education.\nI am very pleased to know  that  the  Assembly  has made progress with the negotiations for a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. My Government is clearly focused on improving security and development conditions in order to reducing migration and the risks that migrants run when embarking on dangerous journeys in their quest to improve their\n \nquality of life. In the meantime, we will continue working to strengthen our entire consular network.\nIn conclusion, I would  like  to  send  a  message of unity and peace to my people and to the entire international community. I will return to my country with the vision and hope of a  better tomorrow for  all. I would like to end by quoting the great Ruben Dar\u00edo when he said about his country: \u201cIf your homeland is small, dream it big\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the great honour to address the General Assembly in the general debate of its seventy-third session.\nWe warmly salute Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s and congratulate her  on her election to preside over this session of the General Assembly, which is meeting under the theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d.  We  assure  her of the full support of Mozambique as she discharges her mandate.\nWe   congratulate    the    outgoing    President, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, on  his  outstanding  success  and commitment to mobilizing the international community towards implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe express our appreciation to the Secretary- General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his dedicated  work and leadership of  the  Organization  on  behalf of the causes of international peace and security and sustainable development.\nI would also like to express our deep condolences on the passing of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Mr. Annan honoured Africa and the whole world with his devotion to just global causes. The Assembly is also taking place at a time when we are celebrating what would have been the 100th birthday of Nelson Mandela, that icon in the fight for freedom, peace, equality and fraternity. Those two great men should inspire us in our collective fight for a better world of peace, prosperity, security and welfare for our peoples.\nMozambique acknowledges the role of the United Nations in promoting dialogue and defending the principle of the peaceful resolution of the conflicts that continue to affect peoples and nations, violating human rights and hindering sustainable and inclusive development. The United Nations is the mother forum of multilateral dialogue, uniting States\u2019 commitments to implementing global agendas and other instruments aimed at enabling us to achieve shared objectives. An unequal and fractured world requires multilateralism to address its gaps. The progress that has been made so far demonstrates unequivocally that the global imperative of  sharing  responsibilities  is  an  essential  element in building a peaceful, just and harmonious world. Examples of that include the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and recent efforts to eliminate nuclear arms and to regulate and humanize migration with a view to averting humanitarian catastrophes. From that list, I should also point to matters relating to human rights and good governance, the peaceful resolution of conflicts and financing for development, among others.\nIn that regard, Mozambique supports the Secretary- General in his efforts to reform the United Nations system with a view to ensuring that it is fit for purpose. Mozambique also commends his inclusive approach  in engaging the States Members of the United Nations at every stage of the process. In addition to those ongoing reforms, accelerating reform of the Security Council is another urgent and important element that will go a long way to reaffirming the relevance of the role of the United Nations in its quest for sustainable solutions to the challenges to  peace  and  security  that humankind is facing. The difficulty of reaching consensus among Member States on negotiating these issues also limits the Security Council\u2019s capacity to act as one of the Organization\u2019s pillars, without which it will be impossible to successfully implement the 2030 Agenda. Those reforms will effectively ensure that the\n \nUnited Nations is relevant to all peoples, which is what we all desire.\nWith regard to peace and security, Mozambique continues to follow with deep concern the many continuing flashpoints of political instability represented by inter- and intra-State conflicts, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. We have closely followed the tensions on the Korean peninsula, as well as the growing problems everywhere of fundamentalism and violent extremism. We hope that the peace initiatives under way at the global level, as well as measures to suppress the recruitment and curb the financing of terrorist groups, will enable us to continue to promote further peaceful development for their peoples.\nThe right to self-determination of the peoples of Western Sahara and Palestine remains a concern for the international community. The lack of progress on the issue of a referendum on  self-determination for the people of Western Sahara is a continuing source  of concern for all peace-loving peoples. With regard  to the Palestinian problem, we believe in a two-State solution, based on two peoples living  side  by  side  and on the principles of international law related to good-neighbourliness, peaceful coexistence, dialogue and tolerance. And Mozambique once again joins the majority of States present in this Hall in appealing for the normalization of political, diplomatic, economic and financial relations between Cuba and the United States of America.\nMozambique has also dedicated much effort to removing obstacles to peace, promoting inclusiveness and creating an environment conducive to equitable and sustainable  development.   Our  commitment  to a constructive national dialogue has enabled us to make significant progress in resolving differences and building an effective, lasting and sustainable peace, which has gone a long way to creating an environment conducive to strengthening national unity and reconciliation and restoring our economy. After I was sworn in as Head of State in January 2015, I decided  to personally commit to the quest for peace. I made that commitment because my country and people were still struggling with tragic conflicts, fomenting wars and punishing the people. Happily, the  weapons  in my country have been silent for more than two years now, thanks to the direct dialogue I engaged in with the late leader of the Mozambican National Resistance Movement. There is now a consensus on all that we have accomplished in my country, and peace has been\nmy biggest achievement as President. In July, as a result of our dialogue, Mozambique saw our Assembly enact a bill amending our Constitution and changing our electoral laws, introducing  innovative  elements to our efforts to decentralize the country with a view to settling post-electoral conflict and strengthening our democracy.\nThose concrete steps in the political dialogue are an indelible landmark in our country\u2019s multiparty history, as we intend, unlike in previous election cycles, to hold our next general election without any armed political parties. A process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is therefore under way for the remaining armed elements of the opposition. As proof that Mozambique is genuinely pro-democracy, on 10 October we will hold municipal elections in 53 municipalities, with the participation of many political parties and civil-society associations. At the end of next year we will hold general elections in line with the agreement by consensus approved by the Assembly of the Republic. Considering the complexity of this issue, both financially and technically, my Government would like to take this solemn opportunity to thank the international community for its support and help, which is not easy to obtain. We still have more work to do to achieve peace, reconciliation and development, and we therefore appeal for more assistance to enable us to ensure the success of the process of disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating the remaining armed elements, which will begin soon.\nThe people of Mozambique are determined to live in peace, and my Government is also committed to fighting the organized crime that is destabilizing and threatening our efforts to achieve national development. We are determined to neutralize the groups of criminals that are trying to disrupt public order and tranquillity in some parts of the northern province of Cabo Delgado. We need everyone to collaborate with us in combating those criminals, because their crimes are global, involving nationals and non-nationals. We cannot think about democracy or human rights when humankind\u2019s fundamental right to life is at risk.\nMozambique takes its commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals very responsibly, and we therefore aligned our 2015 national agenda with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We believe firmly that we can create a more just, equitable society with greater solidarity by implementing the Goals. They represent a basis on which we can broaden social justice\n \nin our country. My Government has made tremendous efforts to implement our national agenda so as to create more opportunities for our citizens, particularly women and young people, within a framework of ensuring democratic dividends in our society.\nMaking the United Nations relevant to everyone means leaving no one behind, a  hugely  important  aim that we must not neglect. We should  therefore give special attention to policies and strategies aimed at protecting people\u2019s full enjoyment of their rights, promoting gender equality and improving capacity- building for women, young people and other vulnerable groups, who make up the majority of our people. Social justice also demands that we promote gender equality, an area where we have had made significant progress at the political, economic and corporate levels.\nWe have also undertaken efforts to increase access to basic health, education, water and sanitation services for all. Another key element we are working on to solidify the relevance of the United Nations for our people is ensuring their food and nutritional security by prioritizing agriculture in our national development strategy. Since our new governance cycle began in 2015, we have mobilized our domestic resources and encouraged hard work by all, and have increased our agricultural and livestock productivity, with the aim of achieving one of the Sustainable Development Goals, the elimination of hunger by 2030, which will require still more public and private investment.\nWith regard to combating corruption, another scourge that impedes our ability to achieve our global, regional and national goals, my Government has promoted measures designed to improve every aspect of governance,  political, economic  and  corporate  by enacting laws, policies and strategies for fighting corruption. We continue to strengthen our institutional and human capacity to ensure the enforcement of our anti-corruption laws and to raise awareness of this scourge\u2019s damaging effects among all members of society and institutions. We must always uphold the principle of the separation of institutional powers.\nWith regard to climate change, Mozambique, as a country very vulnerable to its effects, has continued to take measures for adaptation and resilience within the framework of the Paris Agreement, which we ratified in June. We have adopted a policy of biodiversity conservation to which 25 per cent of our territory is dedicated. We have also promoted the development of\ncommunities in the conservation area and encouraged their involvement in protecting and preserving our valuable natural resources. We have fostered the  use of renewable energies in rural areas, the sustainable management of natural resources,  the  conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, and benefit-sharing. I would like to appeal from this rostrum for international financial and technological cooperation in strengthening our capacity to continue our efforts.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the unconditional commitment of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique to the critical role of the United Nations in finding solutions to the problems afflicting humankind. The United Nations will always be the platform that brings all of us together in a collective commitment to the noble ideas on which this universal Organization was founded \u2014 saving future generations from the scourge for war and promoting social progress, better living conditions and greater freedom. Let us continue to be faithful to the supreme ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and work together to build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to sincerely congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. On behalf of the Government and the people of the Sudan, I wish to express to the President and Vice-Presidents our  sincere  wishes  for every success in their tasks and for a successful session. I would also like to express our appreciation and gratitude for the expertise and effectiveness of  the President\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, in presiding over the seventy-second session.\nThis session is being held under the theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. That reflects the interest of this international Organization in achieving peace and sustainable development while working to ensure fundamental human rights, which are all basic pillars of the United Nations and exemplify the hopes and ambitions that we all aspire to achieve. The Sudan, along with the international community, looks forward\n \nto seeing the United Nations play its leadership role in the promotion of balanced development in peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. In order for our Organization to play that role and serve humankind,  as well as confront increasing challenges in all fields, the Organization should be reformed and become more effective and capable of confronting such challenges.\nThe national dialogue initiative led in  2014  by His Excellency Mr. Omer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir, President of the Republic of the Sudan, resulted in the formation of the Government of National Reconciliation with the participation of political parties all across the political spectrum, including the armed movements in Darfur, which opted for the peaceful settlement in line with the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur.\nThat was positively reflected in the promotion of peace and security throughout the country. It culminated with the successes of the first and second phases of the exit strategy with regard to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) pursuant to Security Council resolutions 2363 (2017) and 2429 (2018). That is yet another success story involving the transition from peacekeeping to recovery, reconstruction and social reconciliation. In that regard, the Government of the Sudan would like to underscore its readiness to continue cooperating fully in order to facilitate the implementation of the third phase.\nWe would also like to commend the partnership between the United Nations and the African Union (AU) in Darfur. We hope that the United Nations, donors, and sisterly and friendly countries will participate meaningfully in the pledging conference due to be held shortly in order to promote stability and finance various recovery, reconstruction and development projects, as well as peacebuilding and sustainable peace programmes in Darfur during the transitional period in preparation for the exit of UNAMID in 2020.\nIt is vital to highlight the successes and tangible results achieved as a result of the national weapons- collection campaign. That was the result  of  the  social sector\u2019s cooperation with the Government in collaboration with partners, notably UNAMID. It led to a reduction in crime rates, as well as to reduced drug and human trafficking. It also led to the greater movement of citizens and their repatriation aimed at undertaking various economic activities.\nThe Government of the Sudan believes that negotiations are the only path leading to peace. It must,\ntherefore, extend a helping hand to the armed groups in South Kordofan  and  Blue  Nile,  and  participate  in all rounds of negotiations in various forums. In order for the Government to create an environment conducive to such negotiations, it has committed itself to the unilateral ceasefire in all theatres of operation for more than two years. It is worth mentioning that the Government of the Sudan launched a number of initiatives to establish humanitarian corridors and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions, but certain rebel movements in Blue Nile areas still refuse to participate in such initiatives. The Government of the Sudan has agreed that the United Nations would shoulder  the task of delivering humanitarian assistance from within the country.\nThe Sudanese Government is making tireless efforts to ensure economic reforms, regulate fiscal policies and set transitional strategic policies aimed at reducing poverty and achieving sustainable  development  goals, as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Despite those wise policies adopted by the Government in order to mobilize local resources, promote the role of the private sector and govern fiscal management, the unilateral sanctions imposed on my country and the impact of accumulated foreign debt continue to undermine our development and our ability to engage in the necessary development activities. They have also reduced our ability to attract essential foreign financing, as we have not been permitted to have any form of debt exemption under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, despite the fact that the Sudan has met all of the technical preconditions. We would also like to recall that the Sudan has the potential to help achieve food security in Africa and the Arab region, so it should be supported in that vital field.\nThe Sudan appreciates the United States Administration\u2019s decision to lift the trade embargo imposed on my country in October 2017. We look forward to having the Sudan removed from the United States list of countries accused of sponsoring terrorism. We also look forward to positive partnerships in future, especially now that we are quite active at both the regional and the international levels in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We refer in particular to the report issued by the United States State Department in September,  which  supported  our approach.\n \nThe Sudan has been an honest defender of the principles of justice and international cooperation, as well as the principle of fighting impunity. However, the selective approach adopted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) has caused that court to lose  the impartiality of judicial bodies and has led to the disappointment of the international community, especially among African countries. The position of the Sudan towards the ICC is therefore aligned with many decisions adopted by the AU, underscoring our view that the ICC is nothing but a political tool that dons the mantle of law in order to achieve political objectives that seek to break the will of peoples, particularly African peoples. The Sudan therefore calls for African voices to be heeded. It warns against the politicization and abuse of the United Nations in the name of international justice based on the Relationship Agreement signed between the United Nations and the ICC, which has a negative influence on the United Nations, pushing it into the realm of international political conflicts.\nMy Government has made concerted efforts to host a large number of refugees, which currently stands at more than 3 million. We provide them with the necessary assistance, which covers more than 70 per cent of their needs, while the international community meets less than 30 per cent of those needs. That places huge pressure on the communities providing assistance to refugees, especially in the light of the harsh economic circumstances that my country faces. Given the fact that those circumstances will not improve in the near future, the influx of refugees into my country will continue  to be a burden. I urge the international community to accelerate the provision of  the  necessary assistance to my country so that it can fulfil its obligations with respect to that humanitarian situation.\nThe Government of my country has made significant progress in the field of promoting human rights in the Sudan. That was recognized by the Human Rights Council in its decision issued in Geneva last week, which underlined our positive cooperation with the Council\u2019s mechanisms.\nMy Government has made great efforts to combat human trafficking and illegal migration, as well as transnational crime, in order to strengthen peace and stability. Thanks to the geographic location of the Sudan in the heart of Africa, that can be achieved at the national, regional and international levels. Those efforts culminated in the joint initiative by the Horn of Africa and the European Union countries to address the\nroot causes and consequences of illegitimate migration in the Horn of Africa region, known as the Khartoum Process. We have high hopes that the international community will reach consensus and recognize the leadership of and role played by the Sudan in the efforts to combat migration-related problems.\nThe Sudan reaffirms its position, which is to reject terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including State terrorism, as a means of achieving political objectives. The Sudan has made clear that position    by committing to and ratifying all relevant regional and international conventions. We have long been an effective member of the international community, at the international, regional and bilateral levels. We have explicitly contributed to combating that phenomenon and have prevented many terrorist operations, thanks to the exchange of information and good institutional relations that link the Sudan with its partners, be they regional, international or bilateral.\nIn that context, my delegation expresses great concern over the growing phenomenon of Islamophobia, which takes various forms.  We  strongly  condemn the acts carried out on that basis, which have led to discrimination, hatred and an environment that is conducive to violence. We stress that terrorism should not be linked to any religion, culture or civilization. The Sudan underscores its cooperation in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy in a comprehensive, sustained and consistent manner. We also underline the need to adopt an inclusive  approach to the fight against terrorism   in all its forms and manifestations, taking into consideration the various cultural, social, economic and political aspects of that phenomenon. The means to accomplish those ends include the eradication of poverty and support for development in developing nations, especially in Africa, and the promotion of dialogue between the North and the South.\nThe Sudan pays great attention to local, regional and international environmental issues. We reaffirm our commitment to all of the conventions relating to the environment, given the negative environmental impact on wide swathes of the Sudan as a result of drought, desertification, the lack of rainfall  and  flooding. That was quite clear in the conflict in Darfur, which started with disputes between herders and farmers caused by the drought that  affected  the  region.  It was a clear demonstration of the direct link between drought, desertification, environmental degradation\n \nand conflicts, especially in Africa. We call upon the international community to support the national and regional initiatives in that field, such as the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative.\nWith regard to the issue of water, my country supports a balanced and comprehensive approach to the management of water resources with other countries in the Nile Basin by promoting coordination and cooperation between those countries. The aim is to achieve the desired goals through various mechanisms, including the Nile Basin Initiative. In that context, the Sudan will continue its endeavours with Egypt, Ethiopia and the remaining Nile Basin countries, so that we can settle all contentious issues related to the Nile waters.\nOnce again, my country\u2019s delegation stresses our full commitment to all of the international treaties and conventions relevant to the maintenance of international peace and security and demilitarization, foremost among them the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which the Sudan acceded in 1973, as well as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, or Pelindaba Treaty. The Sudan also plays a recognizedrole in promoting cooperation among African countries in the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\nWe stress that strengthening the values of peace, security and stability in the world cannot be achieved in the presence of weapons of mass destruction. We are fully committed to supporting all international efforts aimed at eliminating such weapons. The Sudan pays particular attention to small arms and light weapons, since they have a direct relationship to transnational organized crime, terrorism and drug trafficking. To that end, we have been making multifaceted efforts within the African Union, the League of Arab States and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), as well as the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, in addition to our  bilateral  efforts with neighbouring countries aimed at ensuring the demarcation of our borders with full control over them and at setting up customs checkpoints.\nMy country\u2019s delegation would like  to  express our sincere congratulations to the Government  and the brotherly people of the Republic of South Sudan  on the progress achieved in reviving the  Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, which was reached in Addis Ababa\non 12 September. That Agreement was signed by all parties to the conflict, as well as by stakeholders from civil-society organizations, young people, religious leaders and other important members of South Sudan society. That was the result of negotiations undertaken in Khartoum from 25 June to 28 September, thanks to an initiative launched by His Excellency the President of the Sudan and a mandate from IGAD.\nIn that vein, the Khartoum Declaration on good intentions and the ceasefire in South Sudan was signed on 26 July, which was followed by the engagement of all parties to the conflict in the negotiation process. After that, the details were initialled, the last initialling of which took place on 30 August, thanks to the sincere efforts made by the Sudanese mediation team to promote the resolution of African conflicts within the African framework. We also highly appreciate the great efforts made by IGAD and the leaders of its member countries, for they have contributed effectively to the achievements realized. We would like  to  highlight the efforts made by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia  and Head of IGAD, His Excellency Mr. Abiy Ahmed; the President of Uganda, His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Museveni; and the President of Kenya, His Excellency Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta.  Their  concerted  efforts  were in line with those of our President, His Excellency Mr. Omar al-Bashir, all of which led to the possibility of bringing peace to South Sudan.\nWe would also like to thank the Troika countries \u2014 he United States, the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Norway \u2014 for their support for IGAD. They are and we thank them for their moral and material support during the negotiation process. We also thank the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union for their support during that phase.\nIf there is one country on Earth capable of speaking of the sacrifices that it has made for South Sudan, it would be my country, the Sudan. Had the Republic of Sudan not agreed to voluntarily let go of a quarter of its territory, a  third of  its people and three quarters of its petroleum resources, the State of South Sudan would not have been established. The Republic of the Sudan granted the people of South Sudan the right to self-determination in a move unprecedented move on the entire African continent. The only reason was the desire to bring peace and stability to the Sudan and South Sudan. After such massive sacrifices for peace, the Sudan cannot afford to lose peace once again in\n \neither part of the Sudan, that is to say, the Republic of the Sudan or the Republic of South Sudan.\nI would say to those who doubt the capacities of the various leaders in the Republic of South Sudan to work together or the intentions of the region\u2019s  States to stay united in their support for South  Sudan that  we all have no choice but to give peace a chance. We have no hope for a bright future for South Sudan in particular and the region in general without supporting the implementation of the peace agreement that has been reached.\nAs for the donor countries in particular, I would say that the contributions they made in the past will not be in vain, except if the current opportunity to achieve sustainable peace in South Sudan is lost. I therefore call on those countries to continue without hesitation their support for South Sudan, because it is in dire need of such assistance and contributions.\nDuring their previous summit, held in Addis Ababa, the countries of the region called on the Security Council to consider expanding the regional protection force in South Sudan from 4,000 to 8,000 soldiers and to ensure that the Sudan, Uganda, Djibouti and Somalia contribute to that force. We look forward to a quick response to that appeal so that we can fulfil our huge responsibilities as guarantors of peace in South Sudan.\nThe separation of South Sudan from the Sudan was not an easy or smooth process, and many issues remain unresolved between the two neighbouring countries. However, the new environment that  has  resulted  from the mediation initiative among the parties in the Republic of South  Sudan launched by  the  President of the Republic of the  Sudan, Omar Al-Bashir, has  led to a genuine change in the relations between the two brotherly countries. Within just 41 days of that initiative, success was achieved on  several  issues  that had remained unresolved for years. That was possible owing to the considerable trust on the part of President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar of South Sudan in President Omar Al-Bashir of the Sudan and the Sudanese mediator.\nThe current circumstances are therefore conducive to the resolution of all pending issues between the two countries, at the top of which is the Abyei issue. The two parties have begun informal consultations aimed at promoting trust and closing the chapter of controversy forever. The Sudan welcomes the address to the Assembly by the First Vice-President of the Republic of\nSouth Sudan, Mr. Taban Deng Gai, in which he stressed his willingness to contribute positively to the resolution of the problems of South Kordofan and Blue Nile.\nOne of the greatest principles established by this international Organization is that all States, big and small, have the right to be able to live in peace in their regional environment. That right applies to the Republic of the Sudan and to the Republic of South Sudan, as well as to all other States in our region. We call upon the international community to work with all of us in order to apply that great United Nations principle and make it a tangible reality.\nThe Sudan reaffirms its support for the joint initiative of the African Union and the United Nations aimed at bringing peace and stability to the Central African Republic. In that regard, we commend the tireless efforts made by the President of the Central African Republic, Mr. Faustin Archange Touadera. We wish him every success.\nThe Sudan has hosted many parties and armed movements from Central Africa in order to mediate between them and help  reach  an  agreement  to  put an end to the division and fighting in the Central African Republic. We will continue along that path under the umbrella of the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic and in line with the announcement of Mr.  Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, during the high-level meeting on the Central African Republic, which was held during the current session of the General Assembly.\nThe Sudan underscores  its  principled  position on the Palestinian question. We  condemn any  form  of aggression against the religious sites in Palestine, notably Al-Quds Al-Sharif. We stress our support for the Arab Peace Initiative, which seeks to establish a Palestinian State within its 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital, as well as the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories.\nMy delegation also condemns the gross violations of human rights committed against the minority Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, as manifested in the killing of people, the demolition of homes and mosques, and the forced displacement of thousands of people from their villages. We call on the international community to take practical steps to end such violations and bring the perpetrators to account.\n \nThe Sudan reiterates its position in support of the constitutional legitimacy of brotherly Yemen. We call on all political stakeholders to engage in the political process, renounce their infighting and refrain from violence, so that they can reach a political solution in order to stop the bloodshed decimating the Yemeni people, in line with the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference and the Security Council resolutions.\nThe Sudan also reiterates its keen interest in ensuring the territorial integrity of Syria. We support all efforts to overcome the current crisis in Syria, which is becoming more complex each day.\nOnce again, the Sudan underlines the importance of bringing about stability in brotherly Somalia. We call on the international community to provide all necessary support to the Government and the people of Somalia so that they can overcome the challenges facing their country.\nThe delegation of my country welcomes the breakthrough achieved in the relations between the two sisterly neighbours Ethiopia and Eritrea. We look forward to the strengthening of their bilateral relations, which bodes well for their Governments and peoples, as well as for the countries of the wider region.\nWith regard to the situation in Libya, the Sudan\u2019s position has been always to support the brotherly Libyan people and to strive with the international community to ensure the success of the various initiatives that seek to bring security and stability to Libya, particularly through the Skhirat Political Agreement, which represents the main political pillar in that country. We also reject any interference in the internal affairs of Libya, given that such action would have catastrophic repercussions on the stability and security of the country and the wider region. In that context, the Sudan expresses its readiness to host the upcoming meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries neighbouring Libya.\nWe once again express our solidarity with and support for the reform agenda that the Secretary- General is striving to implement and especially the efforts made to strengthen the General Assembly and its various subsidiary organs. The General Assembly is considered the largest and most representative body of  States Members of  the United Nations and plays  an important role in issues relating to international peace and security. Those reforms will ensure that the\nGeneral Assembly is able to meet the requirements of the twenty-first century and address the continuing challenges facing us.\nIn conclusion, my delegation reiterates its commitment to international multilateralism under the leadership of the United Nations. We stress the noble purposes that have been the building blocks of the United Nations, particularly those pertaining to the maintenance of international peace and security, achieving sustainable development and promoting human rights through an approach that is underpinned by international cooperation and dialogue, with a view to enhancing friendly international relations and settling conflicts through peaceful means.\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed an honour and privilege for me to address the General Assembly for the first time in my capacity as the President of the Republic of Botswana, after assuming office on 1 April.\n \nI succeeded our former President Lieutenant General Ser\u00eats\u00ea Khama Ian Khama, who retired at the end of his term in office. It was the fifth time that Botswana has witnessed a smooth transfer of power since its independence, in 1966.\nAllow me to join other delegations in paying tribute to the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, who passed  away  on  18  August. Mr. Annan will be remembered as an international statesman and an icon who devoted his entire life to serving humankind.\nLet me also join other delegations in congratulating Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. Her election is particularly noteworthy as this is only the fourth time a woman has held the position since the founding of our world body, 73 years ago, and she is the first woman to do so from the Latin American and Caribbean region. I would like to assure her of the full support and cooperation of my delegation as she discharges her mandate, and we wish her every success.\nLet me also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, who competently presided over the deliberations of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session.\nI also wish to thank our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his outstanding leadership and stewardship of the United Nations. I want especially to commend him for the reforms that he has initiated, which are aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Organization.\nMy delegation welcomes the theme of the general debate of the seventy-third session of the General Assembly, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. We are particularly pleased to note that it builds on last year\u2019s theme, which also focused on people and emphasized the nexus between peace and a decent life for everyone on the planet. That shows the steadfast commitment  of the United Nations to ensuring sustainable development for all. Clearly, the principle of leaving no one behind should remain our long-term aspiration. It is a clarion call for us to end extreme poverty and ensure the provision of quality education, health care, infrastructure, housing and employment for all.\nI am pleased that the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018 indicates that there are more people living healthier lives today than there were a decade ago. However, we should be reminded  that  much more still needs to be done to achieve prosperity for all, especially in view of the fact that an estimated  783 million people live in extreme poverty, 2.3 billion still lack access to basic levels of sanitation services and 4 billion are without social protection.\nIt is therefore apparent that none of  us, whether big or small, can overcome those gigantic development challenges alone. Consequently, we need to act together to strengthen multilateralism and honour and implement the commitments made by the General Assembly and global partnerships for sustainable development.\nIt is also imperative that the global community continue to support individual countries, taking into account their unique development challenges. For instance, while Botswana is classified as an upper- middle-income country, it is still dealing with many development challenges comparable to those of less- developed countries. However, we are reassured by the words the Secretary-General used when he said that the United Nations\n\u201cstands ready to work with all Member States to make the Sustainable Development Goals a reality for everyone, everywhere\u201d.\nIn view of  the  development  challenges  facing my country, I want to reiterate our appeal for continued support in human capital, infrastructure and capacity development for the private sector and technology transfer.\nOn sustainable development, Botswana reaffirms its commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Accordingly, we have aligned our national Vision 2036 with that global Agenda. At the regional level, we are also pleased that the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 and the Southern African Development Community\u2019s integration agenda are also aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWhat those development agendas have in common is that they are aimed at eradicating poverty and creating inclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies. In that respect, we are pleased to note that extreme poverty continues to decline across the globe, even though we still have a long way to go, given that 35 per cent of\n \nAfrica\u2019s population \u2014 395 million people \u2014 still live in abject poverty.\nAs we begin the third year of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, my Government remains steadfast in its resolve to improve the material and social well-being of Botswana\u2019s population. Our national development agenda places \u201cpeople, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership\u201d at the heart of sustainable development. In that regard, our national Vision 2036 is anchored to four pillars: sustainable economic development; human and social development; sustainable environment; and governance, peace and security.\nIn addition, we have six national priorities that are aligned with our national Vision pillars \u2014 developing diversified sources of economic growth, human capital development and social development, the sustainable use of national resources, the consolidation of good governance,  strengthening  national  security   and the implementation of an effective monitoring and evaluation system. With those in mind, our sustainable development  pathway  strikes  a   balance   among the social, human, economic, environmental and governance dimensions.\nThe implementation of our national Vision 2036 and the eleventh national development plan is underpinned by a robust monitoring and evaluation system to ensure the effective delivery of these  programmes\u2019  goals  and aspirations. Additionally, we have established a national steering committee to effectively coordinate and monitor the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have also developed Botswana\u2019s SDGs road map, which is a guide for the achievement of the goals contained within the SDGs, covering the period from 2017 to 2036.\nMy Government has adopted a  comprehensive and inclusive approach to the implementation and monitoring of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals. It aims  to  ensure  broad  ownership  and  leadership at the local, community and national levels and to break down silos across the development spectrum by forging strategic partnerships among the Government, academia, civil society organizations, community- based organizations, development partners, the private sector, non-State actors and the United Nations system. In pursuit of those goals and aspirations, we have given priority to economic diversification, sustainable economic growth, employment creation and investment\nin human capital with a view to building a prosperous and inclusive society.\nIn particular, the focus is on our young people, who constitute 60 per cent of the population of Botswana. In that regard, our ultimate goal is to attain universal access to pre-primary, primary and secondary education. We are also expanding access to tertiary, technical and vocational education and training. In addition, we are developing a national employment policy, the objective of which is to assist Botswana in reaching gainful and productive employment and decent work for all. Above all, the Government of Botswana has developed several policies, programmes and strategies, such as our economic diversification drive initiative, our citizen economic empowerment policy, youth empowerment scheme and youth development fund, to support sustainable economic development and employment creation.\nTo ensure that development benefits all, my Government continues to make substantial investments in the provision of health care, decent housing and shelter through interventions such as the Treat All Strategy, preventing  mother-to-child   transmission of HIV, a self-help housing agency and a programme to house the destitute. Additionally, the Government provides social protection to such vulnerable groups as children, young persons, the elderly and persons living with disabilities through a policy addressing out-of-school children, the orphan-care programme and the old-age pension scheme. Other development interventions aimed at increasing access to economic and social opportunities include poverty eradication, women and youth empowerment, and a national policy on gender and development.\nFurthermore, we are giving priority to investments in research and development, science, technology and innovation in order to transform Botswana into a high- income-status nation and knowledge-based economy. Investment in information and communications technology is undertaken to promote growth and economic diversification and to support e-Government services and innovation in the economy.\nWe note that the implementation of the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development faces immense constraints in terms  of resources and capacity. In that respect, we welcome the efforts of the United Nations to address those challenges through the adoption of resolution 72/279, on the repositioning of\n \nthe United Nations development system, in May 2018. The resolution is vital in that it aims at supporting countries in their efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is our firm conviction that strengthened United Nations country teams and reinvigorated Resident Coordinator systems will contribute significantly to the achievement of the SDGs.\nBotswana also welcomes the signing of the African Union-United Nations Framework for the Implementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to ensure the effective coordination,  execution  and monitoring  of  those two instruments as well as reporting on them. That coordination will hopefully ensure that there is no duplication of effort, thereby allowing for the effective use of our already limited resources.\nOn human rights, Botswana remains committed  to the promotion and protection of human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law, which are critical to sustainable development, prosperity and peaceful societies. In that regard, we continue to support efforts aimed at fighting impunity and at implementing the principle of the responsibility to protect populations from such atrocities as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Accordingly, we reaffirm our full support for the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC achieved a milestone this year when it commemorated the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of  the Rome Statute, which founded the Court. Since its establishment, in 2002, the International Criminal Court has contributed significantly to the strengthening of the international criminal justice system through its prosecution of grave international crimes.\nOn international peace and security, Botswana remains deeply concerned about the protracted conflicts in Afghanistan, Mali, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It is estimated that over the past decade, violent conflicts have led to the forced displacement of over 68.5 million people. Studies show that conflicts contribute to increases in slums, hunger and food insecurity, thereby worsening humanitarian crises. We therefore urge all parties to those conflicts to uphold  their  obligation  to protect civilians and humanitarian personnel, in accordance with international human rights law and international humanitarian law. We also want to stress that dialogue and the peaceful resolution of conflicts are critical to the maintenance of international peace and security.\nWe want to commend the Secretary-General for initiating reforms of the peace and security pillar aimed at strengthening United Nations capacities in conflict prevention and resolution, mediation, peacekeeping, peacemaking, post-conflict reconstruction and development, peacebuilding and sustaining peace. To bolster international peacemaking efforts, African leaders have committed themselves to funding 25 per cent of peace support operations in Africa by 2021  and to silencing the guns by 2020. I therefore want to applaud regional organizations for their commitment to that noble cause.\nWith regard to corruption, as a global community we need to address the problems of illicit financial flows, money-laundering and corruption, which are haemorrhaging the resources needed to  implement  the SDGs. Among other things, SDG 16 calls for a substantial reduction of corruption and bribery in all their forms, strengthening the recovery and return of stolen assets and developing effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels.\nIn conclusion, I want to reaffirm Botswana\u2019s commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our actions should be bold and transformative as we build a better future for our nations and succeeding generations. We should stand firm behind our mantra of leaving no one behind. Let us not be hesitant in demonstrating global leadership, collective responsibility and collaborative partnerships involving all countries and peoples of the world. The future is truly in our hands.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to address this eminent gathering of nations seized with advancing  the  international  agenda  towards the realization of international peace, sustainable development and the well-being of all humankind.\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of  the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, I extend our congratulations to the President on her election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. As we continue to pursue gender equality across all borders and spheres of endeavour, her election to the post of the presidency of the General Assembly is further impetus for the global rethinking and acceptance of female leadership, and towards strengthening the global pursuit of gender parity, empowerment and equality.\nAllow me to further express the gratitude of the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago to her predecessor, His Excellency Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, whose leadership helped advance the efforts of the United Nations to undertake the ambitious task of system-wide reform. The reform agenda marks a new, emerging approach to multilateral institutionalism and presents an opportunity to transform the United Nations into a dynamic body capable of better responding to the needs and challenges that reflect the diversity of its membership.\nThis year\u2019s theme, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, compels us to reflect on the nexus between the Organization\u2019s ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda and our shared pursuit of a sustainable future for all. The myriad multidimensional threats that litter the international development landscape threaten our efforts to ensure universal sustainable development and the eradication of extreme poverty, as well as peace and security and the enjoyment of fundamental human rights by all.\n \nThe existential threat posed by unmitigated climate change and global warming, extreme poverty, violent extremism, gender-based violence and the spread of new and infectious diseases is one that is best faced together as Members of the  United  Nations.  As  the  bastion of international peace and security, human rights, sustainable development and the rule of law, the United Nations, as an institution, is compelled to adopt a shift in its approach in order to ensure adequate, effective and efficient responses to the challenges of our time.  It is on that basis that the Government of Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms its support for the implementation of the Secretary-General\u2019s reform agenda, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions.\nAs we pursue the cost savings and efficiencies associated with the reform agenda, however, it is imperative that we not lose sight of the foundational principles, values and overarching objectives of this institution. In that regard, I am reminded of the words of our former Secretary-General, the late Kofi Annan. He reminded us that, even though the United Nations is an Organization of States, the Charter of the United Nations is written in the name of \u201cWe the peoples.\u201d Ultimately, that is the role of the United Nations, namely, to serve the needs and hopes of people everywhere. People must be at the centre of our common endeavour.\nHaving recognized that far-reaching truth, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, through wide consultation, developed its Vision 2030 national development strategy. That multidimensional and inclusive development policy places our people, our greatest resource, at the centre of our pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals. If we really are to ensure that no one is left behind, we must redouble our efforts to ensure equitable access to opportunity and mobility for the most vulnerable. Those who have long been left behind must now be positioned to participate in society as equals.\nBy its very nature, the scope of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development speaks to the wide range of issues that challenge global sustainable development. Notwithstanding the global relevance of those challenges, it is widely acknowledged that asymmetries exist with regard to the impact of external shocks on small island developing States (SIDS), such as Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean region.\nThe\tGovernment\tof\tTrinidad\tand\tTobago\nrecognizes\tthe\tSIDS\tAccelerated\tModalities\tof\nAction (SAMOA) Pathway as an essential component in the catalogue of development frameworks needed  to specifically guide the sustainable development of SIDS. Accordingly, Trinidad and Tobago  welcomes the San Pedro Declaration adopted at the Caribbean Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Midterm Review of the SAMOA Pathway in Belize, and looks forward to participating in the high-level review  summit of  the SAMOA Pathway in 2019. Moreover, Trinidad and Tobago takes this opportunity to reinforce the principle that SIDS continue to be a special case for sustainable development, given our complex and intricate challenges. As we and our regional partners prioritize the unique threats to the development of our people, the 2030 Agenda provides an important guide in our efforts to ensure that none of our citizens are left behind.\nIn manifesting the intent of Agenda  2030,  we have come to appreciate the importance of prioritizing the well-being of all of our citizens. In that regard, Trinidad and Tobago and our Caribbean Community (CARICOM) counterparts are taking action to address the threat that the high incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) poses to our region. Those diseases ravage our human resources, burden our health-care systems and undermine our development efforts. Since the adoption of the Port of Spain Declaration on NCDs by the CARICOM Heads of Government in 2007 and the landmark United Nations high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in 2011 (see A/66/PV.3 et seq.), Trinidad and Tobago has implemented a number of strategies for controlling and reducing NCDs.\nOur 2017-2021 National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases aims to harness the collective efforts of both the public and private sectors to prevent and control NCDs. In that regard, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the adoption of the political declaration of the third high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. By raising the standard of living, improving the educational and health-care systems and providing equal access to opportunities, Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Vision  2030  is  actively  pursuing  the  development of a resilient, equitable and healthy society  that places all people at the centre of our sustainable development efforts.\nHowever,   no   challenge  is   more  pressing  than\nclimate change. For small island developing States such\n \nas Trinidad and Tobago, casting doubt on the scientific truth behind climate change only serves to distract and delay the urgent and ambitious action that is needed to confront the existential threat posed by global warming.\nEarlier this year, the Government  of  Trinidad  and Tobago deposited its  instrument  of  ratification to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, thereby formalizing its steadfast commitment to the principles and goals of the Agreement. As our national contribution to achieving the overarching objectives of the Paris Agreement, Trinidad and Tobago has committed to reducing cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions from industry, power generation and the transport sector by 15 per cent by the year 2030.\nAs a State party to the agreement, Trinidad and Tobago will be actively engaged in the negotiating process within the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which seeks to operationalize the Paris Agreement on a scale that will  result  in  achieving the long-term temperature goal and further limit the increase in global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C. It is also hoped that the operationalization process will catalyse international cooperation on mitigation, adaptation and climate finance to that end.\nOur commitment to the  Paris  Agreement reflects Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s assumption of overall responsibility to support international efforts to tackle shared environmental challenges, which include climate change, ozone depletion, land degradation, the loss of biodiversity, the illegal trade in wildlife and the movement of hazardous waste.\nAs a twin-island State, the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources is critically important to the development priorities of Trinidad and Tobago. However, Trinidad and Tobago is located in a region that is highly vulnerable to an unprecedented rate of loss of  marine  biodiversity and to the impact of unsustainable practices on the marine environment.\nWe therefore welcome the first session of the intergovernmental conference that seeks to develop a legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago looks forward to participating in future sessions of the intergovernmental conference\nin 2019 and 2020, which will draft the text of the instrument that will ensure the protection and sustainable management of the common heritage of humankind for the benefit of present and future generations.\nOne of the pressing challenges facing the region is the termination of correspondent banking relations and the labelling of countries in the region as non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. Those actions have severely destabilized the financial sectors of the region without due consideration having been given to the financial, human and technical constraints confronting our member countries.\nAs a result, the region\u2019s efforts to bolster our economic stability and effectively engage in the global financial system have been stymied to the detriment  of our economic growth and progress. That has the potential to further erode the development gains achieved thus far. In that regard, Trinidad and Tobago joins with other CARICOM member States in reiterating our commitment to ensuring compliance with globally accepted standards and calls on our international partners to engage constructively on that issue.\nIn our collective journey towards sustainable development, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago is fully convinced that the United Nations development system will, for the foreseeable future, remain a reliable partner in assisting our country in its efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and our Vision 2030 national development strategy.\nWith that in mind, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to reposition the United Nations development system in order better to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SAMOA Pathway,  including through a reinvigorated resident coordinator system. Trinidad and Tobago reiterates the importance of ensuring that the development system adopts a more responsive and flexible approach to development  assistance,  based on national priorities and needs, while strengthening national ownership and leadership.\nThe United Nations has long recognized the interconnectedness  between  peace  and development\n\u2014 a symbiotic relationship, where one cannot exist without the other. Ongoing conflicts across the world serve as stark reminders of the need to promote a positive, dynamic and participatory international peace and security architecture  that  is  based  on  the  spirit  of    mutual   understanding   and   cooperation  between\n \nGovernments, international organizations and civil society \u2500 one that is in compliance with international obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law.\nThe illegal trade in arms continues to affect the social and economic fabric of the Caribbean region, including Trinidad and Tobago. That is particularly true of the trade in small arms and light weapons, which is linked to other transnational organized crimes, such as drug trafficking. It threatens the livelihood of our people, undermines the rule of law and challenges our efforts to ensure a peaceful, equitable and sustainable country.\nAt the global level, Trinidad and Tobago fully subscribes to the object and purpose of the Arms Trade Treaty, which can be leveraged as a mechanism for reducing  the  incidence  of  armed  violence  in  the region. Thus, since 2010, Trinidad  and  Tobago has presented the biennial resolution on women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, which encourages women\u2019s participation in disarmament decision-making processes.\nOn the issue of denuclearization, Trinidad and Tobago resolutely believes that the use or  the threat of use of nuclear weapons constitutes a crime against humanity and a violation of international law, including the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago therefore remains firm in its support for the full and effective implementation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and is actively considering its signature and ratification.\nTrinidad and Tobago has long recognized that international peace and security must be supported by a robust international legal system, including international criminal justice. Trinidad and Tobago, through the work of our former Prime Minister and President, the late Arthur Robinson, was at the vanguard of efforts to establish the International Criminal Court (ICC) two decades ago. Trinidad and Tobago remains a fervent advocate of the Court, underscoring its importance and legitimacy in various forums. We stand resolute in our commitment to support the mandate of the ICC and to promote the universality of the Rome Statue.\nThe delegation of  Trinidad  and  Tobago  wishes to make the point that, consistent with the principle   of complementarity enshrined in the Rome Statute,  the Court\u2019s jurisdiction is invoked only when States are unable or unwilling to prosecute those accused of\ncommitting the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. At the adoption of the Rome Statute in June 1998, the late Kofi Annan stated that:\n\u201cGradually the world has come to realize that relying on each State or army to punish its own transgressors is not enough. When crimes are committed on such a scale, we know that the State lacks either the power or the will to stop them.\u201d\nTherefore, no individual or State that demonstrates full respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights need fear the ICC. Those who fail to cooperate with the Court are contributing to a culture of impunity that undermines the rule of law and denies justice to victims of heinous crimes.\nOur best efforts to strengthen multilateral peace and security will surely fall short unless there is real and significant reform of the Security Council. While we welcome the continuation of the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, Trinidad and Tobago remains concerned that such discussions have not resulted in tangible progress towards a text-based negotiation. Trinidad and Tobago urges the international community to work collaboratively towards reforming the Security Council so that it can better address current realities and challenges, including those faced by small island developing States, and so that it can improve the effectiveness and credibility of the United Nations with regard to the maintenance of peace and international security.\nThis year, the world has witnessed the unifying power of dialogue and understanding with the recent Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity  and the Unification of the  Korean  Peninsula  between  the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Trinidad and Tobago remains optimistic that that historic milestone will usher in a new era of peace, cooperation and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\nDespite that positive development, we must note that. in our own region, the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continues to stand as the last vestige of the Cold War. In keeping with its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which calls for no one to be left behind, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms its persistent call for the termination of the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba as soon as possible.\n \nAt the heart of our sovereign nations, our cultures and our languages lie individual beings who, at their very core, seek a life of purpose, happiness and the opportunity to live in peace and prosperity. The challenge of our time is to pursue and achieve a sustainable future for all in the face of burgeoning threats to our shared humanity, including but not limited to the threats posed by extreme poverty, rising inequality, climate change and protracted conflicts. Facing that challenge requires deepened partnerships, meaningful dialogue and an appropriate review of established mechanisms and institutions that can, if reformed, exponentially improve our ability to transform lives globally.\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago remains unequivocally committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to the achievement of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We commit to continuing to work in good faith with the United Nations, which has long stood as the cornerstone of multilateralism in the face of unprecedented challenges and threats facing humanity, while ensuring that no one is left behind.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her outstanding election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I am convinced that her qualities and proven knowledge of the United Nations will serve as an asset for the effective conduct of our work. She can count on Gabon\u2019s support throughout her mandate. Allow me also to applaud the remarkable work accomplished by her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, during his term as President at the seventy-second session. I am also pleased to commend the tireless efforts of Secretary- General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in promoting the values and ideals of our Organization.\nOne month after the death of Mr. Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General and winner of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize, I would like to pay tribute to that illustrious man of conviction and unity, whose commitment to peace and development will remain forever etched in our collective memory.\nThe theme of this session, namely, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, provides us with an opportunity to assess the scope of our actions in the light of our commitments and the many challenges of today\u2019s world. It is also an opportunity to develop new perspectives within the three pillars of our collective action, namely, the promotion of development, peace and security and human rights for the well-being of all of the peoples of the world.\nMaking the United Nations an Organization that  is at the service of peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies is a great challenge in the current global context characterized by various threats and at a time when the values and ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are often put to the test. In spite of the magnitude of those obstacles, I remain convinced that multilateralism is the ideal approach for building  a more peaceful, just and inclusive world order. In that regard, it is essential for our Organization to modernize, transform itself and acquire the  appropriate  means for providing adequate responses to the multiple and complex imperatives that we  face today.  That is why  I have welcomed, since the beginning of his mandate, the reforms of the Secretary-General to redeploy the architecture and resources of our Organization  in line with the ambitions and aspirations of the peoples of humankind.\n \nThe peoples of the world \u2014 in particular young people and women \u2014 are demanding that we accelerate the rate of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is the bearer of political and socioeconomic progress and will have a direct impact on the living conditions of the world\u2019s populations. In that context, the fight against poverty must remain at the centre of our actions, given that poverty fuels extremism, which in turn feeds terrorist networks around the world. For Gabon, the fulfilment of our commitments to sustainable development remains linked to the ability of  the  international community to mobilize the necessary financing, establish innovative partnerships at the international level and promote the transfer of technologies, particularly to developing countries.\nGabon reiterates its determination to make every effort to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We are resolutely committed to a process of reforms aimed at accelerating the diversification of our economy. It is a question of moving from an economy that is reliant on the exploitation of natural resources to a model of sustainable and diversified production that will enable a return to sustained economic growth, which will require, inter alia, the promotion of youth employment, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, and efforts to combat social inequalities. Those reforms, which are both structural and cyclical, are mainly based on the equal opportunities programme that was launched two years ago by the President of the Republic of Gabon, Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, and which consists mainly  of moving from a system of undue privilege to one of equality in shared prosperity.\nMaking the United Nations an Organization  at the service of peaceful societies also requires the international community to be more self-sacrificing  in its fight against terrorism and other transnational threats, such as piracy and poaching. To that end, Gabon welcomes the convening of the international conference on combating the financing of Da\u2019esh and Al-Qaida, held on 25 and 26 April in Paris. We hope that the findings of that conference will significantly contribute to strengthening the actions of the international coalition against terrorism.\nWe remain concerned that in many parts of Africa, extremist groups such as Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, though weakened, continue to  sow  terror and desolation. We  are  similarly  concerned  for the Sahel region, where jihadists are now linked\nto trafficking networks and where terrorist attacks continue to undermine the development efforts of the States in the region. Those facts clearly demonstrate the need to accelerate the strengthening of national, regional and subregional capacities so as to provide States with the means needed to ensure their effective security. With foreseeable and adequate funding from the international community, Africa  will  no  doubt be more able to respond appropriately to the security threats that plague the continent. This is an opportunity for my delegation to call for the capacity-building of regional forces, such as the Group of Five for the Sahel and the African Union Mission in Somalia.\nSimilarly, it is important to strengthen our prevention strategies and mechanisms, including by addressing the root causes of crises. As the Assembly is aware, security measures are essential but not sufficient to completely eradicate the activities of terrorist groups. In that regard, strengthening international cooperation is essential. The Joint Summit of the Economic Community of West African States  and  the Economic Community of Central African States, which was held on 30 July in Lom\u00e9 and dealt with peace, security, stability and the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, stemmed from the need to join our efforts to fight effectively against terrorism. The Summit enabled, among other things, a harmonization of the points of view of the regions of Central and West Africa and the adoption of a common approach in order to create the conditions for a secure environment in the common space of the two regions. My country remains resolutely committed to realizing the commitments made during the Summit, while continuing to implement the Central African strategy for combating terrorism and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.\nInternational peace and security have always been at the centre of Gabon\u2019s priorities. It is in that respect that Gabon recently decided to maintain its contingent in the Central African Republic within the framework of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. I am pleased to reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to continue to fulfil its commitments in that regard and contribute to the efforts aimed at achieving lasting peace in that brotherly country, while stressing the need for a political solution based on the Libreville road map that was signed on 17 July 2017.\nDespite the progress made, Central Africa is still beset with many security and humanitarian challenges.\n \nThat is why, as part of our commitment to finding solutions to the various sources of instability throughout the subregion, President Ali Bongo Ondimba initiated a series of consultations with his peers, which resulted in the formal consultation of the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of Central African States on 2 July, on the margins of the thirty- first African Union Summit held in Nouakchott.\nIn reiterating its support for our Organization\u2019s efforts to strengthen peace and security  in  Africa, my country particularly  commends  the  efforts  of  the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy to reinvigorate the political process in Western Sahara. That political process is essential in more than one way; it is realistic and takes into account the specific features of the region, which is undermined by terrorist threats. Gabon would also like to recall that the initiative for autonomy proposed by Morocco is an ideal framework through which to reach a  compromise solution  that  is acceptable to all parties. That initiative conforms with international law and the United Nations Charter and fits perfectly within the framework of the right to self-determination. The Security Council resolutions adopted since 2007 on that issue, including resolution 2414 (2018), have made clear the need to work towards a realistic, pragmatic and sustainable political solution based on compromise.\nThe world is increasingly exposed to the harmful effects of climate change. Given that alarming situation, our Organization must assert its leadership and ensure that the efforts made so far continue and are intensified. Climate change is a reality that impacts our daily lives. Rising temperatures, melting glaciers and polar ice caps and an increase in the number and magnitude of natural disasters are all undeniable signs of climate change.\nThe transformation of our consumption and production patterns and the immediate implementation of the commitments made in Paris are thus becoming an imperative for our universal conscience. In response to those facts, the President of the Gabonese Republic, in his capacity as coordinator of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change, has shown that he clearly understands the urgent need to act quickly, not only for Gabon but also for Africa.\nIt is in that context, that, in December  2017, Gabon provided substantial financial support to efforts to operationalize the Initiative for the Adaptation\nof African Agriculture (AAA), launched  in  2015  with the objective of helping African countries to plan, programme and implement climate-adaptation measures. At the same time, my country organized, in collaboration with the African Union and the United Nations Development Programme, a mobilization round table on 24 September at United Nations Headquarters for the AAA. In that regard, we reiterate our call to bilateral and multilateral partners, including the private sector, to support Africa\u2019s efforts to finance measures aimed at increasing the levels of adaptation and resilience to the effects of climate change.\nOn 10 and 11 December 2018, we will have to take a formal decision on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration during the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in Marrakech. The holistic approach that underpinned the negotiation process leading up the current text under the auspices of the United Nations coincides with a real hope that the world will reach a consensus  that  reflects  the  aspirations of present and future generations. Gabon, a land of hospitality, intends to participate in that important meeting, aware of the scale of the commitments to be made and the assumed responsibilities.\nI would like to reiterate the crucial importance of multilateralism in responding to the challenges that  we face and to the needs of the present world. Our success will be measured by the means that we provide ourselves with in order to bring the Organization closer to the peoples of the world. A stronger United Nations at the service of all \u2014 one that is based on shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable, and sustainable societies \u2014 is possible and within our reach.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to sincerely congratulate the President and her friendly country, the Republic of Ecuador, on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. The fact that  she holds that important position is a reflection of her skill and merit. I also sincerely thank her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his valued efforts in conducting the work of the previous session in a highly professional manner.\nI also wish to express the  great appreciation of  the Kingdom of Bahrain to the  Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his tireless efforts to reform the Organization\u2019s structure and enhance its role in the fields of sustainable development, conflict resolution, the maintenance of international peace and security and many other human issues of interest to all States of the world. Those efforts are tangible and enjoy our full support. I would like as well to recall with great appreciation the role of the late diplomat and former Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and his  endeavours to reform the Organization and work out solutions to international crises. I offer my sincerest condolences to his family and the international community at large.\nUnder the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain and with the support of the Prime Minister, His Royal Highness Prince Khalifa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, and the Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander and First Deputy Prime Minister, His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Kingdom of Bahrain\n \nis keen to implement programmes and plans of all kinds to raise the standard of living and development for its citizens and residents, in keeping up with international efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and take advanced steps in that regard so that everyone can enjoy a decent living and a secure life.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has for many years been classified as a highly advanced country with regard to human development. It has succeeded in mitigating the impact of economic challenges thanks to its economic diversification efforts, its fiscal and monetary policies, and its investment incentives. That has had a positive impact on the Bahraini economy, which is now classified by the International Monetary Fund as one of the fastest\n-growing economies in the region. The discovery of the largest oil and natural-gas reserves since their first discovery and production in the Kingdom of Bahrain in 1932 will, God willing, constitute a strong impetus for Bahrain\u2019s economy in the future.\nAs part of the cooperation with the United Nations, His Royal Highness the Prime Minister issued a decree establishing the Follow-up and Coordination Committee between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the United Nations agencies as an outcome of the strategic partnership for the years 2018-2020. An agreement to that effect was signed by both parties to support the efforts of the Kingdom to achieve its development objectives and the Sustainable Development Goals, in line with the Bahrain Economic Vision 2030.\nDetermined to highlight and document those efforts, my Government presented a few weeks ago its first voluntary national review on the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. That was done here in New York during  the  participation  of my Government in the high-level political forum on sustainable development.\nThe election of the Kingdom of Bahrain to membership in the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations for the period 2019-2022 reflects international appreciation for the policies pursued by His Majesty the King to strengthen rights and liberties and to support common efforts to achieve the objectives and purposes of the United Nations. Consistent with its efforts to continue its international contributions and its determination to cooperate with various organs of the United Nations, the Kingdom of Bahrain submitted for the third time its candidature for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021.\nThat candidature reaffirms our policy of enhancing respect for human rights and maintaining freedoms, in line with international standards and building on the progress already achieved in that field.\nLast March, during the sixty-second session  of the Commission on the Status of Women, nominations were solicited at the United Nations for the Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa Global Award for Women\u2019s Empowerment. The Award aims to highlight achievements in the field of the protection of equal opportunities for women and men in the world. The Kingdom of Bahrain ranks as a Tier 1 country in the report on trafficking in persons issued by the United States State Department in June, making us the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to attain that high status and confirming the great accomplishments of the Kingdom of Bahrain in that field. Tribute was also paid by the State Department to Mr. Osama bin Abdullah Al-Absi, Chief Executive Officer of the Labour Market Regulatory Authority and Chairman  of the National Committee to Combat Trafficking in Persons in the Kingdom of Bahrain \u2014 out of  a  total of 10international  personalities  \u2014  in  appreciation of his extraordinary contribution to the fight against trafficking in persons.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is always looking to contribute to the achievement of a more prosperous future for the peoples of the world. We are  fully  aware of the importance of alliances for preserving regional security and for decisively addressing the challenges and threats to the stability of countries and the development and prosperity of peoples, particularly in the Arab Gulf region, which is considered a central region in the Middle East and the world.\nWe therefore believe that achieving lasting security, stable peace and sustainable development in the countries of the region is a collective responsibility that requires building a robust political, economic and military alliance among responsible countries in that region. Those countries must understand the current threats and the requirements for the future while having a genuine desire, serious will and wise policies that make them indispensable countries for shouldering such responsibility in collaboration with allied countries. That would help to safeguard the security and safety  of countries and peoples, and deter whoever might be tempted to threaten the stability of that strategic region of the world.\n \nThat region is confronted with many dangers, notably from  the  regime  in  Iran  with  its  policy  of destroying and overthrowing States and their institutions, while supporting terrorist and extremist groups and interfering in the internal affairs of other States. The regime in Iran falsely accuses neighbouring countries of instigating events that take place in Iran. It seeks to impose its hegemony on the region by packaging and exporting its miserable revolution, while the Iranian people suffers from its tyranny, oppression and injustice. It disseminates an extremist ideology that has become a constant feature of its foreign policy, and it threatens the aspirations and ambitions of peoples who have coexisted for many centuries. We ourselves have coexisted with Iran and its friendly people, who have an ancient civilization. We were living side byside in an environment of shared heritage, culture, commerce and other aspects.\nThe situation in the Republic of Yemen is a case in point. The Iranian regime supports the militias behind the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Yemen, allowing them to continue their criminal and hostile actions that threaten neighbouring countries through the launching of ballistic missiles against civilian-populated areas in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. That has been confirmed by major countries that are working to achieve security in the region and the reports of the United Nations, including the fifth report of the Secretary-General (S/2018/602) on the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). They clearly indicate that Iran is the origin of those missiles, which constitute serious threats to security and stability in the region and to the major international shipping lanes, the Strait of Hormuz and Bab Al-Mandab.\nAt a time when it is imperative to establish common mechanisms for collective security in the Middle East, we are confronted with another source of impediment to those efforts, namely, Qatar, whose actions threaten the security and stability of the region. Qatar maintains its policies and practices, which run against the concept of collective security through a dangerous approach aimed at spreading and fuelling terrorism and at toppling national Governments while striving to destroy them and dump them into chaos.\nMy country was a target of Qatari plans, which were not limited to the events of 2011, when Qatar provided financial, informational and logistical support for acts of violence and terrorism. Furthermore, Qatar has throughout its history attacked its neighbours repeatedly, including our territory in 1937 and 1986 and\nthe borders of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1992. We reacted with wisdom and foresight to prevent our respective peoples from experiencing any harm. We and the Qataris are one people. We were once under a single leadership, and we are united by origin, family ties, history, objective and a common destiny. Our relations will remain close and impervious to all attempts to stir up strife or alter that everlasting reality.\nWe still hope that Qatar will return to its senses and prove its good intentions and desire to become a positive member of the region by responding to the demands of the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Arab Republic of Egypt. Those demands are consistent with the solid basis of international law, good-neighbourliness, mutual respect and the respect of the sovereignty and independence of States. They seek to put an end  to  the support and financing of terrorism by  Qatar, and to have Qatar implement its commitments under the agreements that it has signed, notably the 2013 Riyadh Agreement and its implementation mechanism, and the subsequent 2014 supplementary agreement.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is working to put into action the various frameworks for constructive cooperation with its partners and friends around the world. We participate effectively in many alliances,  including the Islamic Military  Counter-Terrorism  Coalition, the Global Coalition against Da\u2019esh and the Arab Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen. We reiterate our support for all initiatives aimed at establishing peace and security in the world \u2014 particularly in our region \u2014 beginning with the efforts of the United States of America under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the most important aspects of which are to work with the countries of the region to establish a Middle East strategic alliance, to classify certain terrorist groups that are supported by the Iranian regime and included on the United States Government\u2019s lists of terrorist organizations, and to implement the United States strategy vis-\u00e0-vis the Iranian regime, including the withdrawal from the incomplete nuclear agreement with Iran. We express our commitment to working with our allies to support the security and stability of the region.\nIn that regard, we renew our demand for  an end to Iran\u2019s occupation of the three United Arab Emirates islands \u2014 Greater  Tunb,  Lesser  Tunb  and  Abu Musa \u2014 and for Iran to respond seriously to the efforts of the United Arab Emirates to restore sovereignty over\n \nits territory and resolve the issue through negotiations\nor referral to the International Court of Justice.\nI would be remiss if I did not commend the significant role and constructive efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the regional and international levels, using its prominent status and strategic role to consolidate international peace and security. The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, sponsored an agreement on peace between the Republic of Eritrea and the Democratic Federal republic of Ethiopia.\nThe preservation of the State and its institutions is the main guarantee of the stability of peoples and the revival of communities aimed at preventing them from falling into the abyss of anarchy and terrorism. I want to recall the words of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi of the Arab Republic of Egypt in his statement before the General Assembly a few days ago:\n\u201c[T]here is no way to achieve an effective international order if its main constituent unit, the nation State, which is premised on the notions of citizenship, democracy and equality, is threatened with disintegration The disintegration of nations\nas a result of civil strife and regression to sectarian loyalty rather than national identity is responsible for the most dangerous phenomena in our contemporary world\u201d. (A/73/PV.7, p. 8)\nIn line with that consistent position, we reaffirm the need for a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis with effective Arab participation and a strong Arab role so that that State can exercise control and sovereignty over the totality of its territory and eliminate terrorist groups of all kinds, particularly those supported by Iran, such as Hizbullah and others. We also stress the need to prevent regional interference, which harms Syria\u2019s present and future, and the need to realize the aspirations of the Syrian people for a peaceful and stable life. We welcome the agreement between Russia and Turkey and  reaffirm our support for  the  efforts of Mr. Staffan de Mistura, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria.\nWith regard to the Republic of Yemen, the Kingdom of Bahrain has been  committed to  getting involved  as an active member of the Arab coalition to restore legitimacy in Yemen since its inception. The coalition is committed to restoring peace and security in Yemen and to assisting the brotherly people of Yemen in all humanitarian areas. The coalition is moving forward in\nits mission to guarantee Yemen\u2019s unity, independence and territorial integrity and to put an end to foreign interference in its internal affairs, notably the serious interventions by the Iranian regime, until a political solution is reached with the participation of all, based on the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and its implementation mechanism, as well as the outcomes of the national dialogue and Security Council resolution 2216 (2015).\nIf we really want to have peace and security throughout the Middle East, Jerusalem must remain the historic symbol of coexistence and harmony among religions, as it always has been. The continuation of the conflict in Palestine is not an unavoidable destiny, and the achievement of peace is an attainable objective. We must therefore exert further efforts to reach a just and comprehensive peace that offers the Palestinian people, like all other peoples, the right to a decent life and an independent and sovereign State, with the  borders of 4 June 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital and the right that guarantees the return of refugees on the basis of the two-State solution, in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and relevant resolutions of the international legitimacy. We stress the importance of not altering the legal status of East Jerusalem and the need for the international community to act  in order to put an end to all Israeli measures concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, their sacred sites and places of worship. We also underscore the need to offer all possible assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in order to preserve that United Nations agency and enable it to continue to discharge its noble duties.\nPeace and stability in the Republic of Iraq and the maintenance of its sovereignty and the prosperity of its people are what we wish for that sincere Arab country. We are hopeful that Iraq will resume its leading role in the Arab, regional and international arena. We stress the need to put an end to regional interference in its internal affairs, particularly by the Iranian regime and its various agents, notably armed militias and terrorist organizations and groups, so that Iraq\u2019s brotherly people can enjoy security and prosperity.\nWith regard to Libya, we reiterate the consistent position of the Kingdom of Bahrain, which is to support all efforts towards the reconstruction of the State and the unification of the military institution so that it can protect and defend Libya and confront all forms of terrorism, preserve the unity and territorial integrity of\n \nthe country and meet the aspirations of the brotherly Libyan people  to  achieve  stability,  development  and progress.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain supports the sisterly Kingdom of Morocco against the flagrant Iranian plotting and interference in its  internal affairs, and we  stand behind the serious and credible efforts by  the Kingdom of Morocco to reach a political solution to the issue of the Western Sahara on the basis of the Moroccan initiative of autonomy and the relevant Security Council resolutions and within the framework of the sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco.\nThe Assembly\u2019s choice of the theme of this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d sends one message, namely, that if those objectives are realized, then we would have achieved the  purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and attained our desired goals. The Kingdom of Bahrain believes in this message and implements it while it continues on its development path. It perseveres in its efforts to enhance the security and stability of its people, and will never abandon its role in the strengthening of tolerance, the values of coexistence and the principles of dialogue between States, peoples, cultures and religions.\nWe all witnessed the high-level meeting convened here in New York by the King Hamad Global Centre for Peaceful Coexistence on achieving peaceful and inclusive communities in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 16. We also witnessed the Kingdom of Bahrain Forum, held under the theme \u201cCommon visions for a successful future: national, regional and global challenges and opportunities\u201d. Those initiatives reflect the State of Bahrain\u2019s policies and its faith in partnerships and cooperation with the international community, which seeks to overcome all challenges.\nA State based on an open and diverse society that welcomes all who set foot on its land and live among its people offers \u2014 and has always offered \u2014 a successful model to be followed. A State that has achieved all that it has achieved within such rich diversity and positive openness can only remain faithful to all international covenants and conventions. That is the model of a State that cares for the interests of its people and the region to which it belongs. Its approach will continue to be based on the commitment of everybody to good-\nneighbourliness, mutual respect and to refraining from inflicting harm on others or jeopardizing their security.\nAs for those who go astray and revoke their covenant and those who dissent from those principles and frameworks, the implementation of international law ensures the security and stability of our  States and a return to normality for the sake of a stable and prosperous environment that consists of peaceful countries and reassured peoples in a prosperous and coexisting world.\n"

        "file_text": "For the people of Andorra, 2018 is a year of double celebration, globally and locally speaking. On 28 July, the Principality of Andorra celebrated 25 years since its entry into the United Nations, and on 10 December, it will be 70 years since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nAs I have already mentioned, those two events have both a global and a local significance \u2014 what some people call \u201cglocal\u201d. In fact, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights has a global dimension for Andorra, as well as for the other countries that make up the international community. But it also has strong local roots, because fundamental rights have been respected in Andorra since time immemorial. It is therefore no wonder that the Andorran Constitution expressly states that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is in force in Andorra.\nThat is why our country wanted to play an active part in the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign, emphasizing the  importance  of  the  dissemination  of human rights in the area of education. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, with whom I have had the honour of working in the Ibero-American community in recent years, knows that she can count on Andorra to ensure that the Declaration made on 10 December 1948 remains as valid and as strong as ever. As I have already said, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was already part of Andorran positive law even before Andorra became a Member of the United Nations.\nI would now like us to reflect on what the world was like 25 years ago, when Andorra joined the Organization as a full Member. The year 1993 was a time of hope for everyone. The fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of the Cold War gave way to a wave of unprecedented democratization. Never had so many people in the world lived under democracy as during the final years of the twentieth and the early years of the twenty-first century. Human rights were strengthened, economies grew and inequalities were gradually diminishing. They were years of peace, cooperation and multilateralism, as well as respect, understanding and dialogue among cultures and religions. Around us, on the old continent, they were years of optimism in the long and fruitful process of European construction.\nToday, we all remember that period with a certain degree of nostalgia. We were reminded of that this summer during the meaningful homages paid to the former Secretary-General the late Kofi Annan, who did so much for peace and multilateralism throughout the end of the past century and the beginning of this millennium. We  saw it again just this week during the\n \nPeace Summit dedicated to Nelson Mandela (see A/73/ PV.4 et seq.), who was, without a doubt, one of the key figures of that historic moment.\nTwenty-five years on, many  of  the  hopes  of 1993  have  become  blurred  and,  despite some  of the milestones reached, we have slipped back. The prestigious non-governmental organization Freedom House has noted, year after year, a constant decline in world democracy since 2006. In its most recent report, we read that in 2017, only 4 of every 10 people live in free countries. That slow decline in democratic regimes has been accompanied by an increase in inequality, intolerance and extremism. Even in the most established democracies, we increasingly hear the voices of people who have suffered discrimination in silence for many years \u2014 women, persons with disabilities and victims of sexual abuse or abuse of any kind. All of that shows us that our optimism 25 years ago was rather naive.\nHowever, despite all the disappointments and all the faults, we must still defend the international order that was created by the United Nations just after the end of the Second World War. We must defend that order because it is based on three principles that are  as elemental as they are universal. All of us have the same rights; what affects all of us must be decided by all of us; and any conflict must be solved peacefully and lawfully. When I say \u201call of us\u201d,  I  am referring  to everybody, individually, within a representative democracy and to all countries, on an equal footing, here at the General Assembly.\nRepresentative democracy and multilateralism share a set of common values and it is therefore not surprising that they should end up in crisis at the same time. In my  view,  the democratic multilateral order is threatened by the two extremes of populism and technocracy. In the face of complex problems, populism proposes solutions that are simple but that are not solutions, because they end up creating new problems and calling into question democratic principles and values. In the face of complex problems, technocracy proposes solutions that are as complex as they are elitist and that rather than being inclusive, generate inequality and bypass many people. Populism is fed by the disappointment of people who have been left to one side and have suffered from exclusion, a lack of understanding and inequality.\nIn recent years, we have heard time and time  again that the world is struggling between opening\nup and closing down, between multilateralism and unilateralism, between cooperation and protectionism. But perhaps the mistake lies in wishing to present things in that way. All too often, defenders of the multilateral order and globalization believe that we have made no errors and that it is other people who are mistaken, without seeing that globalization has created antibodies, some harmful and some not \u2014 because perhaps not every kind of globalization is good.\nIn the face of that dialectic between opening up and closing down, we should not seek confrontation but look for balance. There should be a balance between cosmopolitanism and being deeply rooted in tradition, because there are advantages to both. All too often we have focused on the risks of protectionism, populism and closing down, without realizing that there is also another risk \u2014 that of elitist and inhumane globalization, which is not very inclusive, if at all. Very often the solutions that we have found to major international issues \u2014 whether geopolitical, economic or social \u2014 are solutions that do not consider people and that go against one of the themes of the United Nations, the call to leave no one behind.\nI therefore view very positively the theme chosen by the President of the General Assembly, Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s \u2014 with whom we also share the Ibero-American community \u2014 of \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people\u201d. And that means building peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\nThe action of the United Nations, and by extension of the entire international community, must be inclusive and focused on the real problems of people. If we do not do that, we would be persevering in our mistakes; we would be reinforcing an image of international institutions that are difficult to understand and far removed from the concerns of the people, and we would be opening the door to populism even wider. That is why Andorra wants to participate in a particularly active way in promoting and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Goals are focused on the specific, tangible needs of the world population. They are major global objectives that have local applications and impact, and if they are attained, they will reinforce the bonds that are so necessary between people and institutions.\nAndorra presented its first voluntary national review on the Sustainable Development Goals at the high- level political forum on sustainable development of the\n \nEconomic and Social Council last July. As explained in the review, our Government has been working for some time on classifying various of its political endeavours according to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda. We have also launched a campaign to involve the education community, civil society and private companies in promoting and achieving the various Goals. That is a way of opening up and bringing the United Nations and its agenda closer to the people.\nIn our opinion, innovation and the new technologies play a very important role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why we need a cross- cutting alliance between the public and the private sectors so that we can put technological progress in the service of the 2030 Agenda.\nWe have assessed our performance on six Sustainable Development Goals linked to the environment. They are water and sanitation; clean, accessible energy; sustainable cities; responsible consumption and production; the protection of life on Earth and the fight against climate change. Various actions introduced by my Government in recent years are aimed at those goals \u2014 the ongoing improvement of water and air quality; a comprehensive plan of energy transition that has enabled us to reduce our dependence on outside energy sources by promoting renewable energy; direct grants for renewing buildings using energy-efficient criteria and so on. All of those actions are designed to enable us to comply with the 2030 Agenda.\nAndorra has also emphasized two more goals, measures to combat climate change and high-quality education, because they are two things with which Andorran society fully identifies. We therefore champion the validity of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which many countries signed here in New York in April 2016, and we insist that the international community must comply with the agreements and commitments made in Paris in December 2015. We reiterated that view in Paris last December at the One Planet Summit, promoted by the Secretary-General and the President of the French Republic and Co-Prince  of  Andorra, Mr. Emmanuel Macron. Andorra is working to fulfil the commitments of the Paris Agreement and strongly encourages the rest of the international community to do the same.\nAs far as quality education is concerned, Andorra is proud of having a rich, diverse, all-embracing education\nsystem that is available to all citizens. It is a system in which families can opt for Andorran, Spanish or French education at no additional cost. It prepares our young people to become citizens of a global world while remaining deeply rooted in their own identity.  That   is perhaps why a great many Andorran international cooperation efforts focus on the area of education. With the financial support of the Government, several Andorran non-governmental organizations are carrying out projects to  promote  training and  opportunities for street children in Bolivia, educate young girls in Honduras and provide  schooling  for  poor  children in Madagascar.\nIn choosing the theme for this session of the General Assembly \u2014 \u201cGlobal leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d \u2014 our President has spoken about leadership and shared responsibilities. That seems to me to be a key matter. If we allow the action of the United Nations, and by extension that of the entire international community, to move away from people\u2019s real needs, we would be losing leadership.\nIn the face of the increase in populism and extremism, political leaders often feel they are misunderstood. However, misunderstood leaders do not exist, because a misunderstood leader is not a leader. A leader who does not connect with the people is not a leader. The United Nations cannot afford the luxury of disconnecting from the problems, needs, expectations and hopes of the citizens of this globalized world. Andorra therefore offers its support to the plans to reform the architecture of the United Nations that Secretary-General Guterres and his team are carrying out. More effective management of resources is essential, particularly with a management focused on people. That is crucial.\nIn this final part of my statement I would like to tell a personal anecdote. Seven and a half years ago, I took on the responsibility of leading the Government of the Principality of Andorra. The ballot boxes bestowed that responsibility on me again in March 2015. This will therefore be the last time that I address the General Assembly.\nIn Andorra, the entry  of  the  men  and  women  of my generation into political life  coincided  with  the approval of the 1993 Constitution and with the recognition of our country as a full member of the international community. I was elected a Member of\n \nParliament in the same year that Andorra became a part of the United Nations. I am therefore a child of that time of optimism that I mentioned at the beginning, a time when democracy was expanding, economies were growing, and multilateral institutions were becoming stronger. However, it was also up to me and the people of my generation to take on the responsibilities of Government in a time of crisis \u2014 economic crisis, social crisis and a crisis in values \u2014 at a time when what we believed to be solid and resistant was proving to be fragile and unstable.\nOver time, we have grown accustomed to living with that awareness of fragility and instability. When all is said and done, maybe that is not so bad. Our predecessors, the previous generations of Andorrans, were acutely aware of the fragility of the foundations on which our very old institutions stood. If I compare that sense with the spirit of optimism that prevailed  25 years ago, the symbol of our times, the symbol of this current moment, is precisely that awareness of the fragility of the economy, the institutions, the worldwide geopolitical order, the environment and the planet as a whole. Everything seems to be much more fragile and in much greater danger now.\nMoving from that awareness of fragility, we have found the strength to undertake actions that had been sitting on the table for years and to launch reforms that had been pending for decades \u2014 seeking a more open, transparent  and  cooperative  economy,  constructing a more inclusive and all-embracing society, finding sustainable models of growth and preserving the institutions and values that have been handed down through history, adapting them and making them useful for the people of today. Out of necessity we have made a virtue and out of weakness we have found strength so that the younger generations can take up the reins of their times and do so with the same optimism that we had 25 years ago. We must work right through to the last moment so that our disappointments can be transformed into their hope, so that our mistakes give rise to their ability to prevent them from  happening  again,  and so that our good choices serve as the foundations on which they can continue to build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\nAll of us, the older and the younger generations, should always be aware that everything that happens in the global area has local repercussions and that all of the actions that we undertake at the local level contribute to shaping the global society. Hopefully, it is one that\nis fairer in nature, a global society in which everybody feels that they are listened to and included. That is a global society to which Andorra \u2014 because of its small size, but also because of  its serenity, which prevails  as a result of centuries of peaceful existence \u2014 is  fully committed. The Secretary-General is aware of that, as are the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session and all our friends in the international community.\nPoliticians move on. Countries and institutions remain. I am sure that in the future Member States will be able to continue to count on the Principality of Andorra to assist in building a fairer, safer world. That is our task.\n"

        "file_text": "In February, President Espinosa Garc\u00e9s presented her strategic vision for the seventy-third session of the General Assembly: \u201cDialogue and strengthening of multilateralism as a  catalyst  for  the  well-being  of all persons and a sustainable  planet\u201d.  We  welcome her commitment to the theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d.\nThe delegation of Monaco will support her so that, together, we can contribute to aligning our institutions with the Sustainable Development Goals to  ensure that the high-level political forum that we will hold here next year delivers  the  necessary  adjustments  for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nDialogue and the promotion of multilateralism with a human face were also priorities of her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k.  Under  his  presidency,  the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session facilitated the vital progress necessary for United Nations decisions to remain relevant. I would particularly like to emphasize the repositioning of the United Nations system for development as well as the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which is to be formally adopted in Marrakech in December. We warmly thank him for having always listened to our representatives and for having prioritized the common interest, which is the guarantor for the success of multilateralism.\nAs the General Assembly commemorates the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December, how can we not recall the fact that, as the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations states, the reason that we, nations great and small, have committed to working together is \u201cfor the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples\u201d?\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank President Bachelet for having rightly taken up the torch of Prince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein as United Nations High\n \nCommissioner for Human Rights. We assure her of our support and congratulate Prince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein on never having avoided difficulties and on having assiduously championed the defence of human rights.\nThe United Nations and its Member States have continuously adapted to the new challenges posed by violence, conflict, transnational organized crime and the global scourge of terrorism. When the Security Council acts, it does so to ensure on behalf of all States international security and the protection of civilians. When the Council is prevented from acting, civilians, in particular women and children, pay an even higher price. In that regard, can we ignore the report of the Secretary-General (A/72/865), which notes in its paragraph 5 that in 2017, armed conflicts resulted in 6,000 proven cases of violations committed against children by Government forces and more than 15,000 by non-State armed groups? That is why Monaco supported the code of conduct regarding Security Council action against mass atrocity crimes at the seventieth session of the General Assembly.\nIn that spirit, we strongly condemn attacks against schools and hospitals, sexual violence and the denial of access to humanitarian aid. We firmly believe  in the role of women in peace processes. We support the involvement of young people in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. In that understanding, Monaco supports Security Council resolutions on such issues.\nAs the Monaco Red Cross celebrates its seventieth anniversary this year, I would like to recall the Principality\u2019s commitment to strengthening respect for international humanitarian law. We also take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the men and women who have dedicated their lives to the Organization, tirelessly working to ensure that United Nations values prevail, and to the peacekeepers and United Nations officials who have died in the discharge of their mission.\nOur country strongly supports the appointment by the Secretary-General of a Victims\u2019 Rights Advocate, entrusted with placing rights and dignity at the heart of the Organization\u2019s efforts and the zero-tolerance policy towards sexual harassment. We also hope that the principle of the responsibility to protect, contained in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), will at last be acknowledged and harnessed as a tool for progress accepted by all.\nSince joining the United Nations, Monaco has significantly strengthened its legal arsenal. Over\nthe past 25 years, Monaco has ratified, adhered to or accepted more than 40 international treaties on human rights, refugees, privileges and immunities, criminal issues, disarmament, the environment and the law of the sea and has signed eight such treaties.\nEven if today less than 10 per cent of the world\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, the fact  is  that millions of human beings, including women and children, still live below that threshold and consequently are without access to education, health care, decent housing and work and opportunities for economic and social development.\nIn a world where artificial intelligence is developing and where genetic engineering and cyberspace are realities for many of us, how can we  disregard the fact that more than 68 million people were forcibly displaced in 2017 and that the United Nations has delivered assistance to a record number of 105 million people in 40 countries? Is it acceptable that three out of 10 people do not have access to safe drinking water and six out of 10 to sanitation? The Central Emergency Response Fund, to which the Principality contributes, has also funded emergency assistance in 36 countries to the tune of $418 million.\nAs we know, the many crises and challenges that  I have mentioned are interlinked. In that spirit, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). However, what is the paramount challenge facing our human societies today? It is clearly that of climate change. Its systemic effects spare no region of the world and equally are factors in the geopolitical upheaval that exacerbates the inequality and conflict that daily we strive to combat in this forum. Today, if we do not act ambitiously and effectively to combat that scourge, tomorrow we will have to be ready to live on a devastated planet, where it will be very difficult to maintain peace.\nI  therefore endorse  the   Secretary-General\u2019s call, issued earlier this month, to end the paralysis, indifference and weak commitments to the challenge of climate change. Today, the term \u201ccrisis\u201d is nearly obsolete. As Mr. Guterres recalled, to prevent the worst, we must change course by 2020. That is why it is imperative that the negotiations of the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change, to be held in Katowice, result in the adoption of rules\n \nallowing for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. For future generations, we must rise to that challenge.\nMonaco is no exception to that framework. At the national level, the energy transition pact, launched at the beginning of the year, is ambitious and seeks to achieve the goal set by His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of achieving carbon neutrality by  2050  following  a 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. That initiative represents a new concrete action by the Royal Government in order to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The pact is a partnership among all elements of society and demonstrates the will of the Sovereign Prince for Monaco to remain a land of innovation, all the more so if that is likely to accelerate the transition to a carbon-free world.\nIn that regard, we also welcomed with the keenest interest the Secretary-General\u2019s intention to convene a climate summit in 2019. A few days before, Monaco will have hosted a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change  with  a  view  to  issuing the special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate.\nThe maxim that there is no development without peace and no peace without development has continuously guided our work since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. However, progress is uneven and sometimes too slow to ensure that all the goals and targets will be met by 2030. That necessary adaptation to the challenges of  implementing the 2030  Agenda is an important step towards initiating a paradigm shift that will bring more coherence, efficiency and visibility to the work of our Organization, even though it is of course the primary duty of each Member State to remain mobilized.\nIn that regard, Monaco also prioritizes partnerships in its international cooperation given the long-standing evidence. We can achieve our united actions only by leveraging best practices and by constantly reviewing the technical opportunities based on our past experience.\nOur cooperation with local non-governmental organizations in partner countries is based on trust and human involvement. The size  of  our  territory has naturally led us to look towards others. Trust in the links established with Monaco\u2019s 11 international cooperation partnership countries makes  it  possible to support exclusively through grants more than 130 projects a year in priority sectors, namely, education, health,  food  security and socioeconomic integration.\nThe Principality remains a committed and resolute partner in doing its part to make the new paradigm of sustainable development a reality for all.\nOur faith in multilateralism is anchored in the reality of a world of evolving threats. The Principality of Monaco shoulders its responsibility by implementing the principle of one State, one vote enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Monaco is convinced that the United Nations alone remains a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations towards shared goals. The authors of the Charter were visionaries. Like them, we must constantly renew our commitment to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\nIn conclusion, allow me to quote Seneca, who  said: \u201cIt is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.\u201d Given the proliferation of challenges, let us dare to stand closer together. Even if not everything will be resolved in an easily measurable time frame, let us promote understanding among people and respect for our differences. I would be remiss if I did not reiterate our full trust in Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and his transformative initiatives, which will make the United Nations better suited and more likely to effectively and efficiently meet the challenges of tomorrow.\n"

His dedication to Viet Nam and his contributions to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will always be remembered with respect.

I also join others in paying tribute to the memory of the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His efforts to incorporate human rights into the work of all United Nations organs has brought the\n \nUnited Nations closer to the people. He will be long remembered as the Secretary-General who tried to make the world more humane.\nWe are living in a world characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.

Thailand therefore supports the efforts of Secretary- General Guterres to reform the United Nations system so as to make it more effective, efficient and human- centred. Thailand has been active in translating the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations into practices aimed at  promoting  peace  and security, fostering sustainable development and safeguarding human rights.\nOn peace and security, Thailand supports efforts to make the Security Council more representative, more inclusive and more democratic. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment to forge stronger linkages between peace, security and sustainable development, as we believe that it is indeed the economic and social development of the communities and the people that lies at the centre of sustaining peace. Since 1950, over 27,000 Thai military and police personnel, men and women, have proudly served in more than 20 United Nations peacekeeping and related missions. And we will do more. In addition to a number of military and police officers who are currently stationed with three peacekeeping missions, we are getting ready to deploy a horizontal military engineering company to join the United Nations Mission in South Sudan. Wherever Thai peacekeepers go, they simultaneously seek to keep peace and foster sustainable development and to engage in both peacekeeping and peacebuilding.\nThailand also supports a rules-based international order. Last year, Thailand became one of the first States to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. And just this past week, I deposited our instrument of ratification for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which complements ASEAN\u2019s objective of making South-East Asia a nuclear- weapon-free zone. We also support efforts to achieve a peaceful and denuclearized Korean peninsula. We hope, furthermore, to see one day a nuclear-weapon-free Indo-Pacific region. The late United States Senator from New York, Robert Kennedy, paraphrasing George Bernard Shaw, once said, \u201cSome [men] see things as they are, and [ask] \u2018why?\u2019 I dream [of] things that never\nwere and [ask], \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d. Today all 10 South-East Asian nations have ratified the CTBT \u2014 why have the countries in the Indo-Pacific region not all done so? As an Asian proverb states, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. South-East Asia has taken that first step towards a nuclear-weapon-free region. Why have the rest of the Indo-Pacific countries not all done so?\nOn development, Thailand supports the reform of the United Nations development system with a view to making it more effective, efficient and people-centred. We are also reforming our whole country as we implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Committing ourselves to realizing the SDGs is one thing, but implementing them locally is another. That is why the Thai Government strives to empower our local communities, in urban and rural areas, to change for the better, to improve the way we produce and consume, the way we work and travel, and the way we live, in order to achieve sustainability and realize the SDGs. As Mahatma Gandhi once said, we must be the change that we wish to see in the world. Sustainable development can be achieved only when it is inclusive and responds to the needs of people in the society concerned. In Thailand, we have launched our reforms based on what we have called the \u201cpracharat principle\u201d or the public-private-people partnership. Under that principle, the people, the Government and the private sector work closely together to pursue sustainable development. We are applying that holistic approach, uniting all three sectors \u2500 public, private and people \u2500 so as to ensure that all stakeholders are engaged in the country\u2019s development efforts, leaving no one behind.\nIn realizing Sustainable Development Goal 14 on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources, Thailand is the first Asian country to join a global initiative to clean up the oceans around our tourist hotspots, such as Koh Samui, Koh Tao and the famous Phuket. We are also working on raising public awareness of climate change. We are also cooperating with other countries in the region to mitigate the risks of natural disasters, such as the one that just hit Indonesia. Last year, in order to mitigate the human-caused disaster of pollution, in particular in the form of plastic garbage in the seas and oceans, Thailand hosted the ASEAN Conference on Reducing Marine Debris in the ASEAN Region aimed at pooling our efforts to clean the seas in our region. Thailand also hosted the ASEAN-China Workshop on Marine\n \nEnvironmental Protection in the South China Sea, which sought to map a strategy to clean up our regional seas. In those efforts, we are mindful of the warning that marine biologist Rachel Carson gave in her book The Sea Around Us, writing that it is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose, should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself. When we seek to save the seas and the oceans, we are in fact seeking to save humankind.\nOn human rights, we are finalizing the draft of our fourth national human rights plan for the period 2019- 2023, which seeks to address a range of human rights challenges, including issues such as access to land and natural resources, the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons and human rights defenders, and the freedom of the press. We are also drafting a national action plan on business and human rights so as to make our private sector an indispensable partner in mainstreaming human rights into all sectors of Thai society.\nThe Thai Government\u2019s policies seek to address human rights challenges in a  structural manner and to lay the foundation for sustainable democracy in Thailand. In order to address discrimination and protect people in vulnerable situations, we have enacted the Gender Equality Act, various acts to protect vulnerable persons, the Justice Fund Act and the Equitable Education Fund Act. A number of new laws are also in the pipeline, such as a community forest bill that seeks to promote people\u2019s participation in natural resource management, a bill on community banks, a land-tax bill to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, and a bill for the prevention and elimination of forced labour aimed at protecting the rights of workers and at tackling trafficking in  persons.  Thailand  recently  ratified the International Labour Organization\u2019s Protocol to Convention No. 29, on forced labour, as a part of our continued effort to improve Thai labour standards.\nThe Thai Government firmly believes that engagement with civil society is key to an inclusive approach to human rights and sustainable development. Our relevant agencies have been holding periodic consultations with non-governmental organizations working on sustainable development and human rights issues, including in our voluntary national review on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and our national presentations to human rights treaty bodies.\nOur commitment to the three pillars of the United Nations, namely, peace and security, development and human rights, has contributed positively to the stability and prosperity of the Kingdom  of  Thailand.  Since the current Government assumed office four years ago, the rate of growth of Thailand\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has risen from 0.9 per cent in 2014 to\n3.9 per cent. This year, our GDP is expected to grow by between 4.4 and 4.9 per cent. National competitiveness has risen from thirty-seventh place in 2014 to thirty- second place last year. Tourists have returned, with more than 35 million visitors to Thailand last year. This year, the number of tourists coming to Thailand is expected to be close to 40 million, thereby reflecting tourists\u2019 confidence in Thailand\u2019s peace and security.\nOur efforts to realize the SDGs have also improved our people\u2019s lives. The maternal mortality ratio stands at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 live births, and the mortality rate of children under 5 is at 8.6 per 1,000 live births. People\u2019s   access  to  universal  health  care  stands   at\n99.9 per cent. Access to education at the  primary  level  is  at  100  per  cent,  lower  secondary  school at\n88.3 per cent and upper secondary school at 72.7 per cent. Furthermore, 60 per cent of our labour force are women. In our efforts to realize the SDGs, the Royal Thai Government has been guided by  His  Majesty the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej\u2019s sufficiency economy philosophy.\nThe sufficiency economy philosophy teaches us that development must be home-grown and rooted within each citizen in order to be sustainable \u2014 in other words, strength from within builds strength on the outside. The Government has therefore focused our resources so as to empower households and communities through our policies with regard to community banking, community land deeds, community forests, lifting household debts and providing universal health coverage.  Thailand  has also shared our philosophy of development, the sufficiency economy philosophy, with the Group of  77 and China, which has endorsed it as a development model. We have also been working with over twenty countries around the world under the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy for SDGs Partnership, sharing our developmental approach.\nLooking ahead, the Royal Thai Government is laying a strong foundation for stability and development through its twenty-year national strategies. They will transform our country into a strong and modern economy that is ready to cope with the present-day volatile,\n \nuncertain, complex and ambiguous environment and the challenges that we will face throughout the remainder of the twenty-first century.\nThailand was the birthplace of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In 2019, Thailand will assume the chairmanship of ASEAN. Our goal during our chairmanship of ASEAN is to foster the creation of a truly people-centred community, where no one is left behind. Such a community will need to be resilient, dynamic, inclusive and forward-looking. During our chairmanship of ASEAN, we will further strengthen our partnership with the United Nations on its three noble missions: peace and security, sustainable development and human rights.\nIn our partnership with the United Nations on sustainable development, we believe that the Economic and Social Council can help shape directions  and build policy coherence to support us in realizing the SDGs. Thailand will therefore seek membership in the Council for the term 2020-2022. We will try our utmost to support the Council in advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nI am also glad to announce that, in order to reaffirm our support for the repositioning of the United Nations development system, Thailand will contribute $200,000 to the special purpose trust fund to reinvigorate the resident coordinator system. That will enhance the work of the United Nations on the ground and make the Organization more relevant to all people.\nAs a small country, Thailand takes to heart the conviction of the late former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld that, ultimately, international law  is the last defence of small countries. Thailand views the United Nations as an embodiment of international law in action and therefore pledges our full and wholehearted cooperation with the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour and privilege for me to address the Assembly for the first time at the beginning of my tenure as President of the Republic of Paraguay.\nParaguay has always shown its unconditional support for the United Nations system and will continue to unwaveringly assume its commitments as a Member of the Organization, as well as its active responsibility based on the principles that we all recognize \u2014 freedom, justice, national sovereignty, independence and the integrity of States. My nation has a deep sense of equality based on the recognition of human dignity. We reject violence and intolerance and love peace. Ours is a society of diverse cultures. It is bilingual, capable of overcoming difficulties selflessly and responsibly, which requires integrity and righteousness, the civic values intrinsic to democracy.\nWe are very pleased that the most democratic and representative body of our Organization is being led by a woman who is also Latin American. We offer our congratulations and best wishes for success to the new President of the General Assembly, Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s. We also salute Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who is doing an excellent job leading the institution. We reiterate our absolute confidence in and support for his management.\nWe offer our posthumous tribute to the former Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize  laureate  the late Kofi Annan. He was an extraordinary leader, humanist and promoter of peace who took pains to ensure that the Organization serves the peoples as well as the States.\nIn an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world that is evolving at an accelerated pace,  collectively addressing  global  challenges  is an unavoidable responsibility of the international community. The General Assembly must continue to be strengthened, as it is the voice of the nations of the world. The Security Council must be reformed with a view to making it more democratic and inclusive so as to fulfil the mandate of maintaining international peace and security for this and future generations. Paraguay advocates adding more developing countries so as to balance the membership of the Council, as well as totally eliminating the veto, a privilege that no longer corresponds to the political reality of our times.\nThe Republic of Paraguay has strongly supported the reforms promoted by  the  Secretary-General  in the pillars of development, peace and security, and management. We believe that those efforts have been successful and that they have been deployed at the right time, since in order to face the challenges posed by sustainable development, we must have an efficient, transparent Organization that has the capacity to support countries in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly countries with special needs and challenges, such as landlocked developing countries.\nThe poverty that is  currently affecting  millions of human beings is due to the poor distribution of goods rather than their scarcity. As leaders it is our responsibility to stop viewing poverty simply as an economic indicator and instead to see it as a human problem. In our view, ignoring the human aspect when we speak about poverty is going against the principles that this institution and our democracies represent.\nOur Government is committed to making social policies more far-reaching and intensifying our support to human development by improving the democratization of access to education, health care and dignified employment. That is the way forward, in both the medium and long terms, to achieving greater social equity and collective prosperity. We are especially focusing on young people, who have extraordinary\n \npotential to help transform Paraguay and the world. We must take advantage of the opportunity that demography has given us to lay solid foundations for a better future. With that purpose in mind, we are initiating a process for the profound transformation of our education policies that will enable us to bring children and young people into the education system, with a special emphasis on training teachers and professors.\nWe are going to install and consolidate a social protection system that addresses people\u2019s entire lives. Paraguay must protect its people from conception to old age. There are many pending issues in the situation of people with disabilities and this is a key moment for Paraguay as a nation to promote their rights. We will give particular attention to ensuring that our public policies are cross-cutting so that we can implement them fully. We are also working to promote women as a factor for change in our country, creating the conditions necessary for equity, equality and empowerment. With the support of our mothers, wives and daughters, we firmly believe that we can create a better country and society. And our indigenous peoples occupy a special place in our Government. It is time for the State to shoulder the task of creating better living conditions for them. That is a moral obligation.\nParaguay is deeply concerned about the  scourge of terrorism and believes that there can never be any justification for the use  of  violence  as  a  means  to an end. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reaffirm that the fight against terrorism and the protection of human rights are not opposing goals but rather complement and mutually reinforce one another. We continue to work relentlessly with allied countries to fiercely fight every form of crime. We cannot accept the possibility that our borders can become places where criminal organizations can thrive. In the few weeks since my presidential term began, we have carried out some operations that have produced very positive results in the fight  against drug trafficking and have shown through our political will that we are determined not  to  give  up  under  any circumstances.  International   drug  trafficking is accustomed to believing itself untouchable and is constantly seeking power. I have promised my people, and today I pledge it before the entire international community, that we will not allow that to happen. We will continue fighting and working alongside every State to eradicate these criminal networks.\nAs a priority,  climate  change  is  unquestionably a global challenge. We States have a  crucial decision in our hands \u2014 we can slow climate change and deal with its consequences, or deny it and continue making it worse. With its adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015, the international community decided to work together to combat climate change, without ignoring the historical responsibility that the most highly developed nations have for the production of greenhouse gases. The issue of environmental responsibility is shaping Paraguay\u2019s vision for strategic development. We generate more renewable energy per capita than any other country on the planet, and we are also a major exporter of that energy. At the same time, we also intend to expand and improve our national and regional power systems.\nDemocracy has been consolidated in many countries, but we have the obligation to adequately address the demands of a people who are impatient with institutions whose legitimacy has been  jeopardized by corruption, inequality and inefficiency in the face of urgent need. The citizens of Paraguay \u2014 indeed, the citizens of the world \u2014 have woken up. Their voices resound in our streets, calling for us to tackle corruption and impunity, and it is our obligation to listen to them and not ignore their just demands. In my country, we understand that dialogue and convergence are fundamental tools for major reform of the judicial system, which is a priority for us. Judicial security and the efficacy of justice are a nation\u2019s pillars. Without justice there can be no order, and without order chaos reigns, and in chaos there can be no peace or social development. I firmly believe in our institutions and in the importance of reforming and strengthening them so that they respond to our societies\u2019 current and future needs. Only with strong institutions and systems can we ensure the growth of our democracies.\nParaguay is one of the most open economies in the world. We understand that interaction with the world  is an essential element for development. We consider alliances to be an essential way of improving global integration. Our country is firmly committed to full regional integration and aspires to build it in full respect for the sovereignty and independence of each of the Latin American and Caribbean peoples. But we cannot ignore the fact that dictatorial regimes that rob their own populations of their happiness, hopes, dreams and human rights persist on our continent. We want to express our solidarity with the peoples of Venezuela\n \nand Nicaragua in the face of the abuses of power in their countries. We firmly believe that despite our differences, our region must work together to create the wealth and share the prosperity that will benefit our peoples. The pursuit of ideologies as an act of fanaticism or a way to assert superiority must be eradicated. Our goal should be to work for the greater good, while respecting our differences, and for the benefit of our communities.\nEvery country faces individual challenges on its path to sustainable development, but the international community has acknowledged that the most vulnerable countries \u2014 including landlocked developing countries, whose geography creates special needs and challenges \u2014 require special attention. Those needs and challenges make themselves felt mainly in the area of trade. Paraguay has chaired the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries for two years and has made a priority of the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing  Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and urges States, particularly our trading partners and countries of transit, to take the  Programme  of  Action  into  due consideration.\nWe believe that the Arms Trade Treaty and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons represent major steps towards disarmament and non-proliferation. The Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to peacekeeping operations under  the  auspices  of  the United Nations, in  its  belief  in  the  importance of contributing to the achievement of the  purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Paraguayan military and police personnel, duly trained prior to deployment, are currently serving in various United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world.\nParaguay respects international law. All of my Government\u2019s decisions are based on its principles, and we faithfully implement all General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. My country supports Taiwan\u2019s legitimate request to be included in the United Nations system and believes that Taiwan can make a major contribution to our work. This is all based on the principle of universality that characterizes our Organization.\nThis year, we will adopt two historic agreements, the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and the global compact on refugees. Paraguay\nhas actively participated in the negotiations on both documents, which seek to reach agreements that benefit refugees and migrants equally, as well as the countries and communities from which they come, through which they transit and to which they go.\nIn 1958, Paraguay launched the World Friendship Crusade, an endeavour that has deeply moved our people. In May 2011, the General Assembly decided to support that initiative by declaring 30 July as the International Day of Friendship.  I  urge  the  leaders of all Member States of the Organization to promote friendship as a noble and valuable sentiment in the lives of human beings.\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a milestone in the history of humankind that enabled us to recognize formally and for the first time that all people have fundamental rights by virtue of their human condition, without distinction based on race, sex, nationality, religion or any other condition. Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to the Declaration and emphasizes that the United Nations must continue to play a fundamental role in ensuring the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was an enormously important commitment. It represents the beginning of a process of restructuring aimed at transforming the growth paradigms of today\u2019s generations and ensuring the well- being of those of the future. The success of that new global agenda depends on the commitment of States and on international solidarity. We therefore call for that global partnership to mobilize the resources necessary for its full implementation, including technology transfers, knowledge-sharing and capacity-building, particularly as they  relate  to  developing  countries. In fulfilment of the commitment Paraguay made on  25 September 2015, we presented our first voluntary national review of the progress we have made in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in July.\nIn the face of an international scenario characterized by political uncertainty and economic volatility, we need collective and comprehensive strategies with a sense of shared responsibility. That is why it is vital that we decide whether we can allow States to impose themselves and obtain the greatest advantage they can from their position, or whether we should work actively\n \nfor stability and common peace by strengthening multilateral instruments  and mutual cooperation. The United Nations Organization is a continuing work-in-progress. We must all maintain a constant and unalterable commitment to working on strengthening it and building its capacity to adapt and respond to the common challenges facing humankind. May God bless our nations.\n"

        "file_text": "We live  in  times of great opportunities and serious challenges. We are more interconnected than ever, yet the world remains divided in many ways. Technological developments have enabled our world to become a truly global village. Our citizens have become global citizens and are well- informed and strongly driven by developments around the world. They expect global leadership in these times of rapid change and great complexity and look to all of us for inspiration.\nWhat is it that people are looking for today? What is it that they expect of a leader? Mighty words? These do not really matter much anymore. Mighty deeds? Yes indeed, but, foremost, what they expect of us are the simplest of gestures that bring us together and that show our compassion and respect for each other. They expect integrity and inspiration.\n \nThis summer, football \u2014 of all things \u2014 triggered a global response, uniting us for a moment in our common aspirations to excellence. Following the success of the Croatian national team, I received so many congratulatory letters and messages from all corners of the world \u2014 from China, Australia and Saudi Arabia to France, Trinidad and Tobago and Nepal. I thank everyone for their kind words. Vishal Bagale of India kindly said, \u201cTeam Croatia really played well. They won our hearts\u201d. Shabbir Allam wrote in Croatian \u201cSvi kao jedno\u201d \u2014 \u201cWe are all like one\u201d. Gilberto Castillo of Colombia pointed out that the final was\n\u201cwell-deserved for a country  that  has  excelled  in spite of the harsh historic situations it has experienced. It is certainly an example to follow\u201d.\nOpshori Nondona, a 14-year-old girl from Dhaka, Bangladesh, was especially persistent in getting her message through. She wrote:\n\u201cThis year, the whole world has recognized a small beautiful country \u2014 Croatia \u2014 and the power of football. Now the world knows how powerful a small, beautiful nation can be.\u201d\nThese messages are but a fraction of many. What most of them had in common and what I could read in each of them is that Croatia \u2014 not a large country in terms of the size of its territory, its population or even its economic means \u2014 has become a metaphor, for all of these kind people who congratulated us, for what a country can do to inspire others and to reach the top of the world, winning the hearts of people worldwide and rousing enthusiasm that each of their countries can do the same.\n\u201cThe value of a nation is not measured by its size\u201d, underlined Bernard Stem of France. Indeed, one does not need physical size in order to excel; it takes heart and persistence. Above all, you need to share a vision and to work together to make it happen. It is not the size of one\u2019s territory that matters; it is the size and quality of one\u2019s ideas. Magnitude is measured not only in volume, but even more so in determination to reach the goal. Individual Croatian players might have shown great skill and technique on the field, but the reason they triumphed was because they played  together as   a team.\nThe United Nations is a place where we must show our willingness to act together  and  play  together  as a team. Our adversaries are many: poverty; hunger; terrorism and extremism; instability; lack of education; gender inequality and the exclusion of women in many societies; environmental hazards; endangered security and trampled human dignity. We leaders should think of ourselves as a team that needs to work together to take advantage of our strengths and address our weaknesses in order to make our world a better place and inspire excellence globally. We should lead not only in managing crises and solving problems, but in spreading hope and optimism as well. We must demonstrate our humanity, solidarity and compassion and in doing so, we must above all respect one another. Respect is the most valuable asset that we have in interpersonal and international relations.\nIt is our responsibility as States Members of the United Nations to maintain the relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of our Organization and to be  up  to  the task for whatever challenges may confront us. However, raising awareness of the most pressing issues is not enough. We must  also  push  for  the  adoption of the instruments and  frameworks  necessary  to deal with them and, most importantly, secure their implementation. Without that, this rostrum will remain a self-serving global stage, just words without deeds.\nThrough the years, we have often learned the hard way that Governments and international organizations alike have their limits. This has also taught us the value and importance of inclusiveness and the  important role that the private sector, academia, civil society and brilliant individuals can play in many different fields. Croatia has many Luka Modri\u0107s, and not only in sports. Our people excel in so many areas. Marin Solja\u010di\u0107 is a modern-day Nikola Tesla who is developing a wireless transfer of energy, Iva Toli\u0107 is conducting breakthrough work in molecular cell biology, Ivan Mrvo\u0161 is a developer of smart city furniture for the cities of the future and Mate Rimac is building electric cars, to name just a few among countless others.\nSo let us push against the formal limits of our organizations. Let us embrace the abundant talent around us. Let us inspire through science and innovation, through our brilliant individuals at home and our well- established, hard-working diaspora around the world. Let us inspire through our dedicated and tireless work at the United Nations. Deeds, not words; inclusion, not\n \nexclusion or isolation; empowerment and motivation are the keys to success.\nWe are the global village, but more often than not we tend to miss opportunities to bring the global agenda to our homes, communities and families. We also forget to include our homes, communities and families on the global agenda. It takes great tragedies caused by disasters, global crises, wars or climate change to remind us of what we all stand to lose. In today\u2019s world, that approach, embodied in multilateralism, is under ever-increasing strain. This is of particular concern, since the most important issues for humankind cannot be resolved by any State single-handedly or in isolation. Multilateralism is indispensable, but I would agree with those who call for changes to the multilateral system that we should not be complacent. We need to rethink decades-old mechanisms and instruments in order to adapt them to modern times and contemporary needs.\nAs we celebrate two very important anniversaries this year \u2014 the 70 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 25 years of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action \u2014 it is a fitting time to remember that respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law has always  been a  precondition for long-term stability, peace and development. Nor should we forget the seventieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. We must learn from the tragedies of Srebrenica and Rwanda \u2014 \u201ca shame for the United Nations\u201d, as described by the great Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to whom I pay special tribute today. Those dark hours must never be forgotten.\nThis year Croatia marked its fifth year of membership in the European Union (EU). Croatia  is  a telling example of the transformative force of EU membership and the benefits of accession to a space where peace, freedom, human dignity and prosperity are standards, not mere ideals. For those reasons, among others, Croatia strongly supports further EU enlargement to our south-eastern neighbourhood. Resolving all the outstanding legacies of war while constructively engaging in regional cooperation and good-neighbourly relations is of course essential. Within that framework we will maintain a particular focus on issues related to the rights of minorities, missing persons, war crimes jurisdiction, victims of war and domestic processing of war crimes.\nGood and mutually beneficial neighbourly relations depend to a large degree on the words coming from across the border, because  it  takes  only  a  moment to deliver inflammatory and revisionist rhetoric in response to domestic political circumstances. However, repairing the damage caused takes much, much longer. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, our closest neighbour and a country that is extremely important to Croatia, we see a potential risk of legal uncertainty and political and institutional instability in the wake of the upcoming October elections, owing to a failure to amend the electoral framework so that it fully respects the rights and equality of Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, the three constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in line with the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision on the legitimate and proportionate representation of constituent peoples at all levels of Government, including the presidency. And although it is for the two sides involved to resolve the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, we should be extremely cautious when it comes to proposals with potential regional implications, notably on ideas regarding territorial exchanges. Otherwise we could reopen a Pandora\u2019s box of potential new territorial claims that would provoke serious instability and security threats.\nThere are inspiring developments, however, that have also demonstrated brave leadership in our own region of South-East Europe. We warmly welcome the signing of the agreement reached on the name dispute between Skopje and Athens, and we hope that the referendum this coming Sunday will represent a crucial impetus for the country\u2019s successful continuation of its path of integration into Europe.\nBy adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, along with the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, we have sent a powerful message that there is hope for a brighter future. However, if we are to succeed in our endeavours, we have to mobilize all partners to work together. In that way we can achieve social progress, protect the environment, create economic growth and build a more just, stable and peaceful world. Runaway climate change is one of  the  most  serious  threats that we are regularly witnessing \u2014 from heatwaves and forest fires, no longer limited  to  California  or the Mediterranean but now also in places such as Scandinavia, to historic typhoons in Japan or the Philippines and to the melting of the ice sheets on the planet\u2019s poles.\n \nNo country can shield itself from the negative effects of climate change, and Croatia is no exception. With more than 1,000 islands, islets and reefs, and a rich history of Mediterranean heritage, the implementation of the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development right now is crucial to Croatia\u2019s future. All over the world, including Croatia, we are seeing rises in sea temperatures and unprecedented and irreversible changes in ecosystems. In Croatia\u2019s beautiful Adriatic Sea, one of the cleanest in the world, we have already registered more than 20 new species of tropical fish, some of them extremely invasive, that could irreparably shift its environmental balance. We may soon be exposed to the danger of rising sea levels, which is already an existential issue for many small islands around the world. It is estimated that the sea level in the Adriatic will rise by almost half a metre by the year 2100, submerging parts of world heritage places and treasures such as Split, Trogir and Dubrovnik. That is why climate action is not an abstract issue. It is a serious matter requiring our constant and undivided attention.\nOne of the most important climate-action and sustainable-development issues for Croatia is reversing the demographic trends on our islands, which are turning into places where schools have no children and churches see more funerals than baptisms and weddings. And yet the problems that many of these islands are facing are common all over the world. We need to improve affordable transportation and connections between the islands and the mainland. We need to resolve our water- supply issues and provide clean water and sanitation. We need to invest in education, technology, science and innovation so that societies and families can once again flourish on the islands.\nBlue growth could be a solution. It is a long-term strategy to support sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors as a whole. The seas are drivers of the economy, with great potential for innovation and growth, and they are set to grow at twice the rate of the mainstream  economy  by  2030.  That  growth is especially welcome in a number of areas such as sustainable coastal tourism, new health  benefits, better connectivity for islands, sustainable blue growth and jobs, marine technology, renewable energy, the management of maritime ecological threats and the preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as improving safety and security with regard to maritime traffic and cross-border maritime pollution.\nOne of the issues that I  would  particularly like  to emphasize today is marine litter, an increasingly worrying problem that threatens marine life in all of the world\u2019s oceans and affects more than 600 marine species. Croatia\u2019s coastal areas are being severely affected by poorly managed waste from our southern Adriatic neighbours. We have to address the rising problem of plastic pollution in our seas and oceans urgently if we want to leave a liveable world for future generations. Plastic debris \u2014 and each year around 8 million tons of it ends up in our oceans and seas \u2014 is particularly worrying because it is resistant to environmental breakdown. Plastic pollution not only harms sea life,  it also carries toxic pollutants into the food chain, with us humans at the top. We can start solving this problem by educating and engaging everyone in a conversation to rethink plastic, by challenging society\u2019s perception that  this  indestructible  substance  can  be  treated  as disposable.\nIn that regard, particular attention should be given to the Ocean Cleanup project, which is designing and developing the first feasible method to rid the world\u2019s oceans of plastic. Its first mission, to remove 50 per cent of the so-called great Pacific garbage patch in just five years, started several weeks ago. In the media they are calling it Pac-Man, in a reference to the popular early video game. Boyan Slat, the young man behind the invention, is a brilliant scientist of Croatian origin, living in the Netherlands, and he fully deserves to be given credit here today, beneath the United Nations logo, which clearly  shows  our  oceans.  My  country is already actively preparing for the fulfilment of its obligations under the Paris Agreement.\nThis year was  one  of  United  Nations  reforms  in more ways than one \u2014 not only through results achieved in the pivotal sectors of peace and security, development and United Nations management, but also in the transformational nature of our mutual efforts to make our Organization fit for the twenty-first century. The world has changed profoundly  since  1945  and the birth of the United Nations. In our reforms, it is essential that we strike the right balance between the maintenance of the basic framework based on the Charter of the United Nations and the flexibility that our new realities and contemporary  needs  demand. In pursuing United Nations reforms, we must not lose sight of the 2030 Agenda. We need a United Nations that is capable of coping with constant changes and growing challenges in the international arena, whether\n \nin the field of regional security, conflict management, threats to the environment, human rights or front-line technologies that are fundamentally transforming the areas of labour and disarmament alike.\nI want to take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General and his team for their tireless efforts to achieve reform. There is still a lot of work ahead of us, but we should be pleased with this year\u2019s results and trends. If we want to move forward and leave no one behind; if we truly strive to make the United Nations more relevant and, in doing so, more effective, we must also realize that the Organization is and should be much more than just New York, Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi or any other conference location. Multilateralism starts in our own homes and our own minds. It cannot be an annual event. It needs to be our daily routine, a way of doing business in the world. Everything that we want to achieve globally and everything that we have agreed to so far under this dome will be easier to accomplish with the understanding and support of our citizens.\nIn order to confront all the adversities and adversaries mentioned in my speech, both as I have delivered it and in the more complete, written version that has been circulated, we must show our determination to take on the risk of decision-making. We must be open to new ideas and we must show emotion, empathy and above all enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is contagious. As Nelson Mandela \u2014 Madiba \u2014 whose centenary  we celebrated two days ago, may have said, \u201cIt always seems impossible until it\u2019s done.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to extend the cordial greetings of His Holiness, Pope Francis, to the President and to all of the delegations participating in this seventy-third session of the General Assembly.\nAs the international community marks the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights,  on  10  December 1948, it is worthwhile to recall and re-emphasize its assertion that,\n\u201c[The] recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.\u201d\nThe recognition of the inherent dignity of all human beings is the bedrock on which the pillars of the United Nations are grounded. It is the ultimate principle behind the founders\u2019 determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It undergirds all fundamental human rights. It drives the search for justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other appropriate sources of international law, because so many abuses of human dignity begin with a failure to uphold laws that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. It spurs individuals and societies to achieve social progress and better standards of life in greater freedom through what the Holy See calls \u201cintegral human development\u201d.\nTo speak of human dignity 70 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration means, above all, to restate the centrality and intrinsic worth of the human person and to reaffirm the inherent rights shared by all men and women, no matter how young or old, rich or poor, strong or vulnerable, healthy or sick, wanted or undesired, economically productive or incapacitated, or politically influential or insignificant. The world needs, in fact, to regain an all-encompassing vision of the human person, human dignity and human rights, as any reductive vision of the human person inevitably dehumanizes and effectively excludes certain persons\n \nfrom membership in the human race, opening the way to inequality, injustice and injury.\nThe seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration is also a favourable occasion on which to renew our shared commitment, not just in words, but also in practice to those rights that flow from every person\u2019s inherent dignity. The report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization (A/73/1) highlights that fact. Although there has been much progress made in the advancement of human rights at the global level, challenges to the protection of human rights are a global phenomenon. While it is heartening to read of the positive developments in the area of human rights accomplished in the past seven decades, it is sobering to note, however, that one in 10 children continues to be subjected to child labour, one in three people currently in detention  is  held  without  trial, 29 per cent of children under the age of 5 do not have birth registration and 250 million women were married when under the age of 15.\nIt is scandalous to see that human rights continue to be violated today, seven decades after the adoption of the Universal Declaration. The Declaration affirms that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, and yet in many places those rights are not only not respected but their violations are even celebrated. Article 4 states that \u201c[n]o one shall be held in slavery or servitude\u201d, yet tens of millions of people are ensnared by various forms of so-called modern slavery. Article 18 upholds the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the right to change one\u2019s religion or belief, and the freedom to manifest, alone or in community with others, in public or private, that religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. Yet those rights are infringed upon, restricted or denied. In so many places, changing one\u2019s religion or even practising one\u2019s faith can lead to a death sentence or can serve as a reason to be discriminated against.\nEarlier this year, in his address to the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See, Pope Francis noted some trends that, in the very name of the promotion of human rights, are in fact undermining the enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Universal  Declaration  of Human Rights. He  noted that, \u201cdebatable notions of human rights have been advanced that are at odds with the culture of many countries\u201d.  He  cautioned that that trend portends the \u201crisk that, in the very name of human rights, we will see the rise of modern forms of ideological colonization by the stronger and\nthe wealthier to the detriment of the poorer and the most vulnerable\u201d.\nThe seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration affords the international community an occasion to recognize the damage that ideological interpretations or novel rights claims do, in principle and practice, to the human rights and fundamental freedoms actually enshrined in the Universal Declaration and translated into international law and conventions.\nThe Holy See is especially concerned about the increasingly narrow interpretation of the right to life, both at the national level and at the level of the treaty bodies and other human rights mechanisms. That tendency is particularly apparent within a current of the human rights discourse that refuses to recognize the inherent value and dignity of human life at every stage of its beginning, development and end. That approach seeks to create a hierarchy of human rights, by relativizing human dignity, assigning more value and greater rights to the strong and healthy, while discarding the weak. That ideology, unfortunately present in various parts of the United Nations human rights system, leads to some grave inequalities and injustices, often ignoring children in the womb and treating the lives of the elderly and persons with disabilities as expendable or indeed as a burden to society.\nWhile freedom is crucial to the ability of every person to express his or her unique identity, the reduction of a person\u2019s dignity to his or her capacity for self-expression and affirmation is always a grave error and a sign that society is losing its ability to recognize the value and importance of every human life, no matter how vulnerable. It is worth recalling here Pope Francis\u2019s words during a general audience with the elderly on 4 March 2015. He said that \u201ca society without proximity, where gratuity and affection without compensation \u2014 between strangers as well \u2014 is disappearing, is a perverse society\u201d.\nThe same dehumanization occurs when people are reduced to the crimes they may have committed, the country to which they may belong or to their productive capacity. The Holy See reaffirms that the quality of a civilization depends also on how it treats the weakest, the indigent, the elderly, persons with disability, and on the place that it gives them in community life.\nArticle 22 of the Universal Declaration affirms that everyone has the right to social security and to the realization of the economic, social and cultural\n \nrights indispensable to his or her dignity and the free development of his or her personality. Frequently though, because of war and conflict, poverty, natural disasters and other similar causes, that right cannot  be realized in one\u2019s place of birth or residence. Such situations prompt millions to leave their place of residence in order to fulfil their basic human needs elsewhere and to search elsewhere for well-being and happiness for themselves and their loved ones.\nThis year, a long and comprehensive process has been completed aimed at  addressing  the  challenges of international migration. For the first  time  ever,  the international community has engaged in an open and transparent debate on the phenomenon of those movements and on what is needed to manage migration in a more safe, orderly and regular manner. The result is the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which will be adopted this coming December at an international conference to be held in Marrakech, Morocco.\nThe coming global compacts, one for migration and the other on refugees, will provide a continuum of protection for all those forced to flee from their place of residence, including those displaced by sudden- onset and slow-onset natural disasters, climate change and environmental degradation, ensuring that no one is left behind. Taken together, the compacts will affirm our shared responsibility, in the pursuit of the common good, to care for those most in need of solidarity and for those whose dignity and fundamental human rights are most at risk.\nThe strain that many States face in responding to mixed flows, especially when they are unpredictable and overwhelming, was given thorough consideration. What became apparent was not only the need for increased international solidarity and burden- and responsibility-sharing, but also the prior commitment of States to\n\u201cwork together to create conditions that allow communities and individuals to live in safety and dignity in their own countries\u201d (A/CONF.231/3, annex, para. 13).\nThat includes not only increased investment in education and basic health-care infrastructure and services, but also capacity-building and training for young people, with a view to helping them find their place  and affirm their dignity in an increasingly destabilizing global economy. It also requires addressing the root\ncauses and driving factors that lead to displacement before the people in question are constrained to leave their homelands.\nIn order to respect every person\u2019s human dignity, it is indispensable also to create the conditions necessary for the realization of the right to remain. Those conditions include the protection of the family as the basic unit of society. When individuals are forced to leave their families behind, often in search of a better life for their children and loved ones, the very fabric  of society begins to unravel. There is no substitute for family unity, which must be upheld, both for those who remain, as well as for those on the move.\nPope Francis described those shared responsibilities and authentic solidarity in  four  verbs:  to  welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate. The Holy See hopes that the honest effort expended on the global compacts will ensure, in line with those four steps, respect for migrants\u2019 and refugees\u2019 rights and dignity in a spirit of international solidarity while recognizing the sovereign right of States to determine their national migration policy in light of their obligations under international law. In a recent homily during a Holy Mass for Migrants on 6 July 2018, Pope Francis said:\n\u201cFaced with the challenges of contemporary movements of migration, the only reasonable response is one of solidarity and mercy... A just policy is one at the service of the person, of every person involved; a policy that provides for solutions that can ensure security [and] respect for the rights and dignity of all; a policy concerned with the good of one\u2019s own country, while taking into account that of others in an ever more interconnected world.\u201d\nThe Holy See hopes that the global compacts will serve as useful tools for good migration management at every level and a common resource for achieving our shared responsibility, given the plight of refugees, and as reference points for international cooperation in the management of migration and the care for refugees.\nThe Universal Declaration reminds us that the defence of the \u201cinherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is  the  foundation of  ...  peace in the  world\u201d.   Article\n1 affirms that we are \u201cendowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood\u201d. Wars and armed conflicts are, therefore, not only violations of reason, conscience and\n \nbrotherhood, but they also cause the worst violations of human dignity and basic human rights.\nIn the Middle East, the multifaceted political and diplomatic pressures and violence, together with the various humanitarian situations, especially in Syria, must be adequately and urgently addressed by the international community. Furthermore, all interested parties must also demonstrate a unified will to strive for an end to violence and work to reach, as Pope Francis stated, a solution that can enable Palestinians and Israelis alike to live at last in peace within clearly established and internationally recognized borders, thus implementing the two-State solution.\nThe Holy See remains concerned about the ongoing political tensions and instability in Nicaragua and Venezuela, especially with regard to the humanitarian crisis in the latter. There is also a need to promote a genuine public awareness of a number of ongoing situations of conflict with a view to reaching a negotiated and peaceful solution, especially in Ukraine, Libya and the Central African Republic, among others. The Holy See considers the recent political developments in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, as positive signs toward the building of peaceful and democratic societies based on the firm hope that agreements reached will be mutually respected. War and armed conflict can be prevented only by promoting and protecting the dignity of every human life and by fostering a culture of peace animated by sincere mutual respect, dialogue and solidarity. The tragedy of the First World War, whose end 100 years ago we will mark in November, teaches us, as Pope Francis stated, that victory must not be followed by the humiliation of a defeated foe and that peace can be achieved only when nations can discuss matters on equal terms.\nA culture of  peace  implies  fighting  injustice and rooting out, in a non-violent way, the causes of discord that lead to wars. The pursuit of peace requires renouncing the use of violence to vindicate one\u2019s rights, since countering violence with violence leads to more death and destruction, deeper  resentment  and hatred lasting for decades, atrocities and forced mass migrations, and the diversion of vast amounts of resources from development to military ends. Fostering a culture of peace likewise entails the intensification of our efforts to achieve disarmament and the rejection of the use of force in the conduct of international affairs.\nEvery effort in that direction, however modest, helps to build a culture of peace.\nThe Holy See underlines the deep bonds between the promotion of the culture of peace and the strengthening of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The proliferation of weapons, in fact, aggravates conflicts and generates vast human and material costs, hindering human and economic development and the search for lasting peace. As the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/73/1) emphasizes, we need to reinvigorate disarmament, because it is pivotal to preserving human society through the prevention of conflict and the reduction of violence, and to saving lives and ensuring a safer world. In that perspective, the Holy See is firmly committed to the full implementation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the various programmes of action in the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons fields, as well as those relating to cluster munitions, anti-personnel mines and small arms and light weapons.\nThe responsibility to defend human dignity and rights is particularly acute in situations where people fall victim to genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Today, at a time when the  many  national  and  regional  conflicts  add  up  to what Pope Francis has called a third world war fought piecemeal, the need to protect populations is more urgent than ever. It is worthwhile to recall that, although the responsibility to protect was defined only at the 2005 World Summit, it has always been at the root of the United Nations.\nAlready in the early part of the sixteenth century, when the concept of national sovereign States was emerging, the Spanish friar Francisco de Vitoria described the responsibility of governors to protect their citizens as an aspect of natural reason shared by all nations and a rule for an international order whose task is to regulate relations between peoples. The principles that De Vitoria articulated in the sixteenth century have been enshrined in the 2005 World Summit Outcome document (resolution 60/1). The Holy See upholds the perennial validity of the responsibility to protect and calls for its full, impartial and consistent implementation. Such an implementation necessarily entails fulfilling all obligations under international human rights and international humanitarian law, as well as condemning any deliberate attacks against civilian targets. It means preventing or stopping crimes\n \nagainst humanity and protecting populations from them through greater legal, political and moral accountability.\nPeace requires forgiveness. Forgiveness is central to reconciliation and peacebuilding, since it makes possible the healing and rebuilding of human relations. Forgiveness is not opposed to justice, but it is rather its fulfilment, since it leads to the healing of the wounds that fester in human hearts, while acknowledging the evil that has been committed. A culture of peace involves, therefore, the courageous choice of not allowing the wounds of the past to bleed into the present, so that  we can walk together towards reconciliation. Every religion is called upon to assist in the reconciliation effort  by  promoting  peace.  Equally  important  is the testimony given when different religions come together to pray and work for  peace.  Interreligious and intercultural dialogue provides the world with a paradigm to share their respective cultural patrimony, grow in mutual appreciation of others\u2019 perspectives, heal past wounds, and journey together toward peace and human development. Religious men and women, moved as they are to revere each other\u2019s God-given dignity, have a special responsibility to bear witness by respectful and constructive dialogue among cultures.\nAlthough, even today, there are some acts of religiously motivated violence, the response to them must not be a renewed form of retaliatory justice, but rather authentic dialogue between the various religious communities on the basis of the joint and unequivocal belief that killing others in the name of God offends God himself. Terrorism is not an outgrowth of properly understood religion, but rather the fruit of a profound spiritual poverty. Defeating it requires the joint contribution of all religious and political leaders. Religious leaders must therefore promote those values that foster the love of one\u2019s neighbour. For their part, political leaders must ensure the enjoyment of the right to religious freedom, while acknowledging religion\u2019s positive contribution to the building of a civil society that sees no opposition between the participation in the political community and the  spiritual dimension of life. They must also ensure that there are no conditions \u2014 such as poverty, insufficient support for families and inadequate investment in education and culture \u2014 that favour the spread of fundamentalism.\nThe Holy See wishes to reaffirm its heartfelt concern for all victims of terrorism. At the same time, it wishes to underline that all measures to combat terrorist activities must fully respect human rights. In particular,\ncounter-terrorism measures should not hinder the legitimate work of charitable organizations, including those motivated by faith, aimed at caring for vulnerable populations. It must be recognized that humanitarian assistance in underdeveloped countries and in crisis zones contributes positively to the prevention of terrorism and retaliatory violence, which thereby fosters the enjoyment of human rights and the respect for dignity. As noted in the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization, terrorism is a worldwide scourge and requires a globally coordinated response. The Holy See welcomes all efforts to enhance multilateral cooperation against terrorism, such as the recent United Nations High-level Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of Member States.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that the equal rights of men and women flow from their inherent dignity and worth. It is therefore necessary to adopt all measures needed to promote equality in rights and the full and equal participation of women and men in society.\nWhile history books sing the victories of emperors and warriors, all of civilization owes an unpayable debt of gratitude to the less chronicled or even unknown contributions of women and men that have shaped civilizations. While textbooks normally obsess about the names at the top of political hierarchies and are preoccupied fundamentally with economic and military trends, it is worth recalling that genuine human progress happens more fundamentally in the relations that human beings have with one another and in the way in which human beings care for one another.\nToday, women and men are at the forefront of the revolution of tenderness that Pope Francis has insisted the world urgently needs. In response to various forms of human suffering and to material, emotional or even spiritual necessities, people need help and remedies that accord with the fullness of their human dignity. Having gone through multiple traumas, they need to be cared for and treated with great sensitivity and attention.\nBeyond their professional competence and technical knowledge, women have, indeed, shown a special capacity for recognizing, affirming, nurturing and defending the inherent dignity of others, and for contributing greatly to efforts aimed at promoting a peaceful, respectful and harmonious world. As Pope Francis has affirmed, women look at life through their own eyes, and men are not able to look at life in the\n \nway that women do. The way of viewing a problem, of seeing anything, is different for a woman compared to a man. They must be complementary. The true progress in humanity that is dramatically needed in our challenged world will also depend on the full participation of women on an equal and same footing with men in the civil, political, social, economic or cultural fields.\nWe note with great concern that women\u2019s indispensable role is often undervalued and can even be a vehicle for the exploitation and violation of their dignity and fundamental rights. Today, women still face a variety of challenges and difficulties in various parts of the world. They experience discrimination in the workplace; they are often forced to choose between work and family; and they disproportionately suffer in conflict situations. In poor and developing countries, women bear the heaviest burdens: it is they who travel many miles in search of water, who too often do not have access even to the most basic medical assistance that they need in childbirth, and who are kidnapped for sexual exploitation or forced into marriage. At times, they are even denied the right to life simply for being female.\nThe authentic advancement of women entails absolute respect for their inherent dignity, while acknowledging their crucial roles, not only in the various spheres of society, but also in the family, as equal participants in marriage as spouses. It is therefore contradictory to seek to promote women\u2019s empowerment while suppressing their unique natural potentialities in the name of some particular interests or in the exercise of an ideological agenda. It is equally contradictory when women\u2019s irreplaceable contribution to society through motherhood  is  stigmatized  as  an  obstacle to their advancement and empowerment, instead of being acknowledged, supported and accompanied with measures aimed at alleviating the difficulties that they may encounter. The Holy See wishes to avail itself of this occasion to express grateful appreciation for all those women who, sometimes heroically, have raised and educated generations of responsible  daughters and sons. The world owes them gratitude and esteem, support and solidarity.\nThe Universal Declaration understands human dignity as the dignity of the person within society, since the person always exists in relation to others. Article 16, paragraph 3, of the Declaration stresses that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society\nand the State. Article 25 affirms that motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. Article 26 underlines that parents have a  prior right  to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.\nThose principles have perennial validity, even in the midst of changing societies, and must be upheld for the good of every child, every family and every society. As Pope Francis reminds us, the strength of the family lies in its capacity to love and to teach how to love. The family is a school of humanity, a school that teaches  us to open our hearts to others\u2019 needs, to be attentive to their lives. As such, it remains a model, as well as a reference, for the promotion of harmony within society and among the family of nations.\nThe family is the greatest treasure for a country and for future generations. In particular, it is urgent to promote the protection of children today, as children are regularly victims of armed conflict, violence, various forms of exploitation  and  abuse,  and  are  exposed  to hunger and extreme poverty. The way we care for every child shows the depth of our humanity and of our appreciation for the dignity and rights of each person. For its part, the Roman Catholic Church is committed, at all levels, not only to promoting the protection of children, but also to creating safe environments for them in its own institutions, in order to address the heinous scourge of sexual abuse and violence against children.\nWhen the Universal Declaration speaks about development, it also does so with regard to the free and full development of the human person. For the Holy See, development must always be integral, which means, in the words of Pope Paul VI, that it cannot be restricted to economic growth alone. Authentic development must be well rounded, and it  must foster the development  of each person and of the whole person. Respect for human rights and human dignity, based on a profound appreciation of  the whole  person and every person,   is essential for efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and to promote integral human development. Without paying attention to those fundamental anthropological coordinates, the sustainable development agenda would be reduced to its economic, environmental or sociological elements.\nExtreme poverty is more than a socioeconomic problem;  it  is  also  an  ethical  one,  flowing  from   a globalization of indifference exacerbated by consumerism. The alternative to that individualistic,\n \nindifferent and self-centred approach is an interpersonal one that involves personal, social, economic and environmental advancement and solidarity. That principle of interconnectedness is found in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In adopting those documents, we committed ourselves to promoting integral and authentic development in harmony with nature. We should put all our efforts into achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the demanding goals of the Paris Agreement. The Holy See hopes that the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Katowice, Poland, this December, will provide a strong step in that direction through a good and effective advancement on the work programme of the Paris Agreement.\nThe Secretary-General has described in his report (E/2018/64) some of the recent progress made in the area of integral development across the world. The mortality rate of children under 5has dropped by 47 per cent in the past 10 years. The proportion of the population of the least developed countries with access to electricity has more than doubled since 2000. Unemployment has decreased in many countries, as various institutions and frameworks needed for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda have been put into place.\nThe report stresses, however, that progress has been uneven and too slow to meet the ambitious goals of the Agenda. By 2015, 30 per cent of people worldwide still did not have access to safe drinking water, while 60 per cent did not have access to adequate sanitation. After a prolonged decline, world hunger has been rising again. The recent  2018  High-level  Political  Forum on Sustainable Development showed that there is an urgent need to step up efforts focused on energy, water and ecosystems. Moreover, the recent rise in trade tensions and the growing scepticism with regard to multilateralism endanger the coordinated global effort to sustainable development for all.\nThe centrality of the human person must also be reaffirmed in the context of the current environmental crisis. As Pope Francis has reminded us, we are not faced with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather one complex crisis that is both social and environmental. That complex reality involves\nnot only our common home but also our partners on this planet and therefore demands an integrated ethical approach that simultaneously cares for the environment while it combats poverty and exclusion, assures the collective enjoyment of the common good, and fosters intergenerational solidarity.\nSuch an approach requires taking with the utmost seriousness our responsibility to care for our precious natural resources and to protect those persons, especially the poorest, who depend on them for their daily subsistence. I am thinking, above all, of issues relating to food security and food safety, as well as access to clean water and the management of the oceans. Without an approach informed by ethical considerations, we are left with an economic system where  financial  gain and political power are placed  above  the  good of the environment and those most vulnerable. An ethical approach to the current crisis must also inspire solidarity with future generations. As Pope Francis reminds us, intergenerational solidarity is not optional, but rather a basic question of justice, since the world we have received also belongs to those who will follow us. While care for our common home benefits us, it is also a gift to future generations, sparing them from paying the price of environmental deterioration and ensuring that they will be able to enjoy its beauty, wonder and manifold endowment."

The outgoing President deserves our appreciation for successfully steering the Assembly\u2019s work during the previous session. We also commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for the dedication, commitment and leadership with which he has been serving the Organization. As we commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Nelson Mandela, I would like to express my profound respect for that great leader and the cause he fought for. An iconic figure, he was a great human soul and remains a source of inspiration for peace, justice, harmony, forgiveness and reconciliation. This year, we have also lost an outstanding diplomat and visionary in the former Secretary-General, the late Kofi Annan. I also pay sincere tribute to the tremendous contributions he made to the promotion of peace, development and human rights in the world.\nI bring greetings and best wishes from the land of Buddha and Sagarmatha, also known as Mount Everest, for the success of this session of the Assembly. Since I addressed the Assembly from this rostrum in 2006 (see\n \nA/61/PV.18), Nepal has undergone a historic political transformation. Through dialogue and deliberations, mutual respect and accommodation, we have  steered  a uniquely successful home-grown, nationally  led  and nationally owned peace process. It was about the peaceful transformation of an armed conflict. It was about the restructuring of the State and promoting unity in diversity. It was about making the Nepali people truly sovereign and a source of State power, and it was about institutionalizing and consolidating all those achievements in a democratic constitution through a popularly elected constituent assembly.\nDespite the difficulties in the wake of devastating earthquakes, the political leaders rose to the occasion with a common resolve to promulgate the new Constitution in September 2015, therefore fulfilling the seven-decade-long aspirations of the people to write their own constitution. The Constitution of Nepal not only consolidates democratic polity under a federal republican order, but also embodies the extensive rights and freedoms of the people. The separation of powers, the system of checks and balances, the rule of  law,  the independence of the judiciary, periodic elections, and inclusive and proportional representation are the defining features of the new Constitution.\nOur vision is one of a comprehensive democracy that empowers individuals not only politically but also socially, economically and culturally. Implementing the Constitution was another paramount task before us. We accomplished that historic task last year through the free, fair and impartial elections at the federal, provincial and local levels with a record turnout and the participation of people from all sections of our society. Most importantly, the elections produced elected bodies with a 41 per cent proportion of women. We remain committed  to  bridging  the  gap of the remaining 9 per cent to reach 50 per cent. The elections not only ensured the democratic rights of the Nepali people in the widest possible manner, they also produced the strongest Government for many years. The Government that I lead has the support of more than three quarters of our Parliament. Governments in the provinces also enjoy strong majority support. We have achieved much-needed political stability through those landmark elections.\nWith those historic achievements, we have laid the foundations for creating an egalitarian and just society, where all citizens are treated equally and receive equal protection and opportunities. Social justice remains at\nthe centre of our polity. The United Nations and the international community supported our peace process, for which we are grateful. Nepal\u2019s case is a unique example of a peaceful and democratic transformation. It is telling testimony to the fact that dialogue triumphs over differences and ballots  triumph  over  bullets.  We believe that what Nepal has achieved in conflict transformation can be an inspiring success story for many people longing for peace in  various  parts  of the world. We are willing to share our experiences and provide our insights.\nWith hard lessons learned in the arduous journey of democratic transition, we have emerged as a confident nation capable of sustaining political gains while undertaking a course of economic transformation. Cognizant of the need to accelerate the process of development, my Government has set a vision entitled Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali. We will realize that vision with the right mix of the prudent utilization of our natural resources and the optimal mobilization and management of the human resources with which we are endowed. We count on the continued goodwill, support and cooperation of the international community in our development endeavours. Our foreign policy guides us to maintain amity with all and  enmity  with none. It has shaped our independent outlook on global issues, which we consider on their merits. We believe that regional and global efforts complement our national development efforts. In line with our foreign- policy priority favouring regional cooperation, we recently hosted the fourth summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation. We would like to see a revitalized South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation as an important regional organization.\nThe world today is at an important juncture with a unique juxtaposition of perils and promises. Challenges ranging from poverty, terrorism, climate change, food insecurity, forced displacement and natural disasters to an arms race continue to confront the global community. Intra-State conflicts have taken a heavy toll on millions of lives. For  the first time in decades, world  hunger is rising after a prolonged decline. In many regions, peace remains obscure.  Inequality  within  nations,  as well as among them, is increasing. Countries have failed to adopt sustainable production and consumption patterns. In that regard, the theme of the general debate, entitled \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for\n \npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, resonates well with the needs of our time.\nNepal supports the seven priority areas that the President of the General Assembly eloquently outlined in her inaugural address (see A/73/PV.1) to the Assembly earlier this week. I hope that the current session will seriously deliberate on those priority areas with the gravity and urgency that they deserve. Therein lies our political will and determination. With that commitment, we must ensure that the voice of the people struggling for their rights, liberty, freedom and justice in various parts of the world, including Syria, Yemen, Palestine and many other places, is heard and addressed.\nThe endeavour to make the United Nations relevant to all people is well captured in the philosophy of leaving no one behind. Global efforts for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in  its third year appear too few and insufficient by far. Needless to say, the least developed countries (LDCs) are the battleground on which the 2030 Agenda will be won or lost. Development in the LDCs appears dismal despite the global economy\u2019s record performance. International support measures  are  failing  to  make a dent.\nThe implementation of internationally agreed commitments made to promote  those  commitments is far below our expectations. Reaching out first to those furthest behind is not a luxury. It is not a charity either. It is an international obligation, duty and social responsibility. The impact will be fully realized only when external support measures respect national ownership and leadership, are aligned with national priorities and come through a national system. Such measures must work to build productive capacity, create jobs and develop human resources. Only easy access to markets, the removal of trade barriers, the injection of financing and investments, the building of capacity and the transfer of technology, and the overcoming of infrastructural bottlenecks can enable LDCs, especially landlocked least developed countries, to take the path to sustainable development and integrate themselves into global value chains.\nWith regard to climate change, the clock of caution is loudly ticking. The impact of climate change burdens the poorest and most vulnerable countries, like my own country, Nepal, despite their negligible emissions of greenhouse gases. We cannot remain a bystander when snow-clad mountains, known as the water towers of the\nworld, are receding, glaciers are retreating and erratic weather patterns are causing floods and inundation in the plains. It is an unpleasant irony that we have been the victims of catastrophes that others have caused. The impacts of climate change on mountainous and small island countries are felt as an existential threat. The loss of lives, property and biodiversity and the increasing phenomenon of calamities  are  becoming  untenable. A matching and robust response is required. We cannot evade the responsibility, nor will there be any excuse for inaction. We must act decisively to ensure that climate justice respects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. To make that happen, international cooperation and collaboration to promote adaptation and mitigation are a sine qua non. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change must be implemented in its entirety and in good faith.\nThe health and well-being of our children and young people are an investment in the future. Delivering quality education, imparting skills and spurring innovation can together produce a virtuous composite force enabling young people to be relevant and able to contribute to society and nation-building. We must support the full development of their potential, creativity and energy to flourish. Inculcating an entrepreneurial spirit and creating decent job opportunities for youth can fuel economic development and help positively transform our societies. At the same time, we must also inculcate them with civil and moral values so that they become a force for harmony and tolerance in society.\nThe frontiers of technology are ever expanding, and they have been a major driving force for societal transformation. But the digital dividend is unevenly distributed, and the digital divide is widening. Technology has been a powerful agent of change and transformation. At the same time, the technological revolution is disruptive. The developing countries, especially the LDCs, are struggling to cope with the new modes of production and consumption. We must create an environment that can ensure easy access to affordable technology and remove barriers preventing their transfer. It should provide a level playing field for all countries so that they can benefit from and propel economic growth through new technologies.\nThis year, the United Nations has taken the boldest reform initiatives in decades. The cross-pillar restructuring of the Organization provides us with an important opportunity to strengthen its development\n \npillar and demonstrate its efficiency in delivery. We believe that a repositioned United Nations development system will better deliver on the 2030 Agenda. It is important that a new generation of country teams learn new methods so that we can ensure a sound system, but, more than that, the unlearning of old habits \u2014 which demanded that we undertake this reform \u2014 is equally important. What matters also in the reform is the transformation of the culture. The new culture must include accountability, transparency and national ownership at its core. Nepal welcomes the reforms undertaken in the peace  and  security  architecture,  as well as in the management of the Organization.  The United  Nations  should  reflect  the  mosaic  of  its membership and achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness. Security Council reform is long overdue. Any reform must reflect current realities and ensure justice for historically underrepresented and developing countries.\nNepal reaffirms its principled stand for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. In that context, we welcome the recent efforts made by the United States and the two Koreas towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the establishment of peace and stability there. Nepal welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s agenda for disarmament with the hope  of  a  renewed  impetus for disarmament. Nepal commends the beginning of deliberations within the framework of the Kathmandu process for developing innovative confidence-building measures  in  the   Asia-Pacific   region.   No   region is immune from the menace of terrorism. Nepal strongly condemns all acts of terrorism, committed  by whomever and for whatever purposes. Nepal calls for an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention against terrorism.\nNever has the issue of human mobility figured so prominently on the agenda of the United Nations. Nepal looks forward to the December Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt a Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Ensuring the human rights and the well-being of all migrant workers remains our priority. Nepal believes that the compact will serve that purpose and make migration work for all. Nepal has hosted thousands of refugees for decades on humanitarian grounds. The international community must uphold the right of refugees to return to their homeland safely and with full dignity.\nThe complexities and intractability of global conflicts render the current efforts to promote conflict prevention even more important. Mediation \u2014 an underutilized tool \u2014 can be applicable in all phases of the conflict continuum. Nepal recently marked six decades of its partnership for peace with the United Nations. Nepal has responded to every call, even on the shortest notice and without national caveats. Nepal welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative and has endorsed the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations. Troop- and police-contributing countries must be provided with fair opportunities to serve in leadership positions, both at Headquarters and in field missions. A sustained partnership for the capacity- building of peacekeepers and providing for their safety and security can enhance the performance of peace operations. Nepal condemns attacks on peacekeepers. Ending the indignity of sexual exploitation and abuse is a must. Nonetheless, peace missions alone cannot be a substitute for home-grown preventive and conflict- resolution measures. Our own experience demonstrates that peacekeeping alone cannot do what politically negotiated settlements can do.\nNepal\u2019s commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights is total and unflinching. We hold development, democracy and respect for human rights as interdependent and  mutually  reinforcing.  As a member of the Human Rights Council, we will continue to play our constructive role  in delivering  on the Council\u2019s mandates. The ongoing transitional justice process in Nepal respects the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), as well  as the reality on the ground, in our efforts to sustain peace and deliver justice. We will not allow impunity in cases involving serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law.\nWe are living in an uncertain world. Cold War rivalries are resurfacing. Trade tensions are mounting. Multilateralism is being questioned. The Secretary- General\u2019s opening statement largely captures the realities of the contemporary world and the sentiment of Member States in the areas of peace and security, sustainable development, climate change, migration and technology. We underscore the centrality of the United Nations as the most legitimate multilateral forum in which to deliberate the challenges that we   all confront globally. It is the obligation of all Member\n \nStates to preserve the sanctity of multilateralism and uphold respect for international law. The  problems that we are confronting today on a global scale can be overcome only by global collaboration and partnership in absolute trust and confidence. We have yet to make an international system that is truly inclusive and promotes fairness, equality and justice for all States, both big and small.\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate Nepal\u2019s profound commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We remain as firm on that score as we have been for the past 63 years since we joined the Organization. The onus  of  providing the world with direction lies on us. Our collective wisdom and leadership should aim at the realization of the aspirations of all for peace and prosperity. Let us collectively resolve that the history of the twenty-first century shall not be written as one of confrontation, conflict, poverty, exclusion, underdevelopment, injustice and exploitation. It should rather be a history of cooperation, harmony, prosperity, inclusion, development, justice and fairness.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Excellency Paul Biya, President of the Republic of Cameroon, I would first like to offer the President our sincere and warm congratulations on her election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. This is a historic moment, given that she is only the fourth woman to preside over the Assembly in the 73 years of the existence of the United Nations. I am sure that her diplomatic background and knowledge of the United Nations system will guarantee her success in the performance of her duties. I would also like to express my gratitude to her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, who distinguished himself through his contribution to advancing the values of the Organization we share. I would also like to congratulate Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on his commitment to accomplishing the delicate tasks assigned to him by the Charter of the United Nations and on his efforts to carry out reforms aimed at achieving a more effective United Nations that is focused on people and development. My delegation welcomes the theme that the President chose for this session, namely, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. Persistent hotbeds of tension, in particular in Africa and the Near and Middle East, as well as the emergence of new issues such as terrorism, violent extremism, migration, natural disasters and climate change, to name but a few, threaten the foundations of our civilization and bring to the forefront the issue of the ability of the United Nations to provide adequate responses to contemporary problems. The expanding scope of global public goods now makes it essential that the Organization be capable of being, in the words of the Charter, a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of those common ends.\nThe growing complexity of the problems of our time, as well as the  unprecedented interdependence  of nations and peoples, require collective action and global solutions. The United Nations is today the best reflection and embodiment of multilateralism, which is, more than ever before, the most appropriate way to respond to the challenges facing humankind. That is the very essence of our Organization, which, it should be recalled, was created to save succeeding generations from war, promote social progress and create better living conditions for all peoples.\nTo that end, my country believes that  the  role and future of the United Nations continue to depend on the willingness of Member States to strengthen its legitimacy, democratization and representativeness, so as not to leave anyone behind. That necessarily involves reforms of its organs, including the Security Council. In that respect, we cannot continue to marginalize Africa, which remains the only continent that does not have a permanent seat in the main body in charge of international peace and security.\nThe role and future of the United Nations also depend on the equitable treatment of its three pillars: international peace and security, development and human rights. We must not lose sight of the fact that human beings, whose development depends on living conditions, are at the heart of the Organization\u2019s objectives. The complex relationship between peace, development and human rights allows us to consider the eradication of poverty and the improvement of people\u2019s living conditions as the surest means of achieving lasting peace, adequate protection of the individual and viable democracy. As President Paul Biya stated\n \nseveral years ago, democracy without development is  a delusion that gives rise to terrible disappointments.\nIn recent months, the news has been dominated   in particular by moving images of men, women and children who lost their lives trying to cross seas and borders in search of a better future. We cannot remain insensitive to that issue. In the framework of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which will be adopted during the intergovernmental conference scheduled for December in Morocco, we must acknowledge the fact that poverty, unemployment, weakening purchasing power and, in short, uncertain futures constitute so many violations of human dignity and, consequently, so many breaches of the peace, so many causes of political instability, so many drivers  of migration, which, if nothing is done, will be neither safe nor orderly nor regular. The question of migratory flows should therefore draw the attention of our collective conscience and remind us of the importance of effective solidarity and shared prosperity.\nWith regard to collective security, we remain convinced that the settlement of international or domestic disputes must be carried out in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In addition, we must redouble our efforts to achieve disarmament. In that regard, Cameroon believes, however, that  the  attention  and  resources  devoted  to the issue of nuclear and chemical weapons should not overshadow the centrality of the  problem  posed by small arms and light weapons on the international agenda. It should be noted that, according to available statistics, more than 90 per cent of the victims of war around the world, and particularly in Africa, are killed by that type of weapon. In addition, small arms and light weapons are increasingly falling into the hands of terrorist groups such as the Islamic State, Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram and others.\nCameroon is pleased to have hosted, in Yaound\u00e9 from 11 to 13 June, the first Central African Convention for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, Their Ammunition and All Parts and Components That Can Be Used for Their Manufacture, Repair and Assembly. Under the leadership  of  my  country,  which  holds the biennial presidency of that first Conference, the Central African States have unreservedly committed to combating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in all States parties to the Kinshasa Convention by mobilizing adequate operational \u2014 both institutional and logistical \u2014 resources. The Central African States\nintend to strengthen, among themselves and with other partners, including the United Nations, cooperation, coordination,  networking  and  the   interoperability of resources for the effective implementation of the Kinshasa Convention to combat the illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons. Cameroon knows that it can count on the support of the United Nations and the Secretary-General.\nWith regard to the global economic situation, despite signs of recovery, growth in many regions remains below the levels needed for rapid progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is therefore necessary to increase the net international financial flows to developing countries, which have declined in recent years. However, we should not deceive ourselves \u2014 honouring official development assistance commitments alone will not make it possible to meet all the funding needs for achieving the SDGs. The means of implementation set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development should, therefore, be fully mobilized at all levels.\nHere I would emphasize the need to change the economic structure of most African economies, which focus economic activity on the extractive industries and the commodity-production sectors. Owing to the limited impact of other sectors, such production patterns generate few jobs and promote inequality, while sowing the seeds of social unrest. The solution lies, therefore, in transforming the African economies, particularly through industrialization and economic diversification. It is therefore more appropriate than ever to provide more support to African countries in order to help them to reduce their debt burden, improve their production capacities and, lastly, help their products gain access to global markets under more favourable conditions.\nWith regard to the specific case of international trade, Africa still faces the threat of protectionism, to which, in our view, the most appropriate solution is the establishment of a universal multilateral trading system based on open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and fair rules, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. Cameroon is aware of its responsibilities in the current context. The challenge of achieving collective prosperity in my country means adopting ambitious and realistic development policies and programmes and instilling democratic values in our\n \nsociopolitical life, as well as including good governance and the fight against corruption on our priority agenda.\nOn the economic front more specifically, my country has resolutely pursued the development of productive, structural and promising sectors, without which we cannot envisage improving the living conditions of  the population. That is the objective of our long-term vision, whose goal, in line with the political agenda   of President Biya, is to make Cameroon an emerging country by 2035.\nOn the environmental front, my country, which was among the first States to ratify the Paris Agreement, remains firmly committed to preserving biodiversity. Therefore, in order to protect the climatic balance of the planet, Cameroon, a country in the Congo Basin and the second most forested  country  in  Africa, took the courageous decision  not  to  make  full  use of its forests. In that regard, it is necessary to find urgent and appropriate solutions so as  to  reconcile the environmental protection initiatives adopted by Cameroon in the interest of all and the legitimate aspirations of its people for their well-being.\nIn the same vein, Cameroon would like to reiterate the need for a number of urgent actions to preserve Lake Chad, which today has been reduced by more than 90 per cent of its initial surface area. It is an issue of survival for the local communities, whose livelihoods depend on preserving that body of water. Cameroon would like to take this opportunity to express its sincere gratitude to the international donors that, in a spirit of solidarity, pledged a total of \u20ac1.5 billion for that cause at the donor conference held in early September.\nWith regard to the democratic process in my country, we have improved our electoral system not only by strengthening electoral mechanisms but also through legislative and regulatory measures designed to ensure a high participation rate in upcoming electoral contests, the next being the presidential election scheduled for  7 October this year. The strengthening of democratic culture in Cameroon is an inevitable process despite the security challenges that we face.\nThanks to the sacrifices of the entire Cameroonian nation, combined with efforts coordinated with our neighbours in the Lake Chad basin and the support of our international partners, the capacity of the Boko Haram terrorist group to do harm has been significantly reduced, although it is necessary to remain mobilized until its complete eradication.\nRegarding the sociopolitical situation in the North- West and South-West regions, our Government remains determined to stabilize it. The corporatist demands of the teachers\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 unions, which are at the root of that situation, have continued to be the subject of negotiations with those socioprofessional categories. Solutions, which have sometimes gone beyond the problems raised, have been found.\nUnfortunately \u2014 and Cameroon wishes to state this from this rostrum \u2014 individuals without faith or law thought it necessary to turn those socioprofessional concerns into secessionist demands aimed at breaking up the State, going outside constitutional and democratic mechanisms. Having chosen as their modus operandi the perpetration of terrorist acts, armed gangs have burned schools and hospitals and violated children\u2019s right to education by preventing them from going to school and by kidnapping and killing department officials, defence and security officers and indigenous authorities, as well as any citizen who does not subscribe to their destructive ideology. To date, nearly 100 members of the armed forces of our country have lost their lives without including the many families overwhelmed by those barbaric acts.\nThe current situation has led to the deterioration of both the economic fabric and the  school  and health systems of those two regions. That picture is compounded by the fact that people have been displaced within the national territory and towards Nigeria, a neighbouring friendly country. In the light of all this, our Government is working to restore peace and security in both regions, with respect for human rights and the laws and regulations of the Republic. In addition, sensitive to the plight of the populations concerned, the President of the Republic, His Excellency Paul Biya, decided to implement, on 21 June, an emergency humanitarian assistance plan for the people of  the two regions with a provisional budget of CFA 12.7 billion. The funds allocated to the plan are being complemented by financing from a remarkable outpouring of solidarity and generosity from all other regions and segments of the Cameroonian population.\nCameroon, a former trusteeship territory of the United Nations, invites the Assembly and all States and peoples who are friends of Cameroon and who are committed to peace and justice to support it in mobilizing resources and implementing that humanitarian plan with a view to providing better assistance to those populations. The Government would like to express\n \nits gratitude to our partners who, since the launch of that plan, have spontaneously given us their support. In any case, the Government of Cameroon would like to reaffirm its dedication to peace and stability and its resolve to take into account the concerns of the people. We have shown on several occasions, and we reiterate today, our openness to dialogue, but with strict respect for the institutions and laws of the Republic.\nStrong measures have already been taken to address the situation that I  mentioned. I  would like  to note, for example, the creation of the National Commission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism and a fully fledged ministry in charge of decentralization. The aim is to accelerate a shift towards the management of local affairs by the concerned populations themselves.\nThe Government of Cameroon wishes to reiterate its unwavering commitment to ensuring the security of persons and property, as well as to protecting its national unity and integrity. In that regard, the Government welcomes the rejection by the entire population of Cameroon, and especially by the people of those two regions, of any attempt at secession.\nIn conclusion, Cameroon, a country whose independence was led and supervised by the United Nations, would like to reaffirm in this Hall not only its faith in our Organization, but also its commitment to peace and stability, without which no development is possible.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to address the General Assembly at its seventy-third session on behalf of the Government and the people of Liberia. I should like at the outset to congratulate the President of the General Assembly, and the Government and the people of Ecuador, on her election to serve as President of the Assembly at its seventy-third session. With our eyes on history, Liberia takes special note of the fact she is the fourth woman to serve as President of the General Assembly, and we welcome her election.\nI should also like to express my appreciation to Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, whose dynamism and far-sighted leadership continues to strengthen the United Nations in the face of perennial global challenges.\nJust two weeks ago, we joined millions in Ghana and around the world in bidding final farewell to former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who devoted his life to peacemaking and conflict resolution \u2014 a calling in which he was renowned and successful. With his passing, Africa has lost one of its most illustrious sons and the world has lost one of the most outstanding diplomats of our time. May his soul rest in perfect peace.\nLate last year, Liberians participated in presidential and legislative elections, the results of which represented a major shift in the underlying fundamentals of Liberian political dynamics. In an orderly, lawful and peaceful manner, Liberians voted in overwhelming numbers for change and hope. This was the first time in 73 years that Liberians enjoyed a peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected Government to another. At the end of the long campaign, when the results were announced after the run-off, it became clear that the pendulum had swung in the direction of youthful leadership and the paradigm had shifted in favour of change and transformation.\nThe United Nations and its various bodies, as well as regional organizations and many of our bilateral partners and friends, directly witnessed the maturity of the Liberian electorate, our respect for law and order,\n \nand our successful democratic processes. The mantle and responsibility for leading that transformation was thereby placed on my shoulders, as the standard-bearer of the winning Coalition for Democratic Change, with my inauguration, on 22 January, as the twenty-fourth President of Liberia. The  challenges  of  leadership are enormous, but, in each and every one of those challenges, I see opportunities to make things better and to bring permanent improvements to the lives of all Liberians, as we devise policies and programmes that will have a lasting and positive impact on the lives of our citizens.\nThe umbrella programme under which we intend to pursue prosperity is the Pro-Poor Agenda for Development and Prosperity, our national development plan for the next five years. The Agenda is not only for the poor, it is for the benefit of all Liberians. But it is policy framework that gives priority to the alleviation of poverty, and its core objective and focus are to reduce the marginalization of the most vulnerable, while also creating a conducive atmosphere for middle- and upper- income Liberians to grow and prosper. We want to build a harmonious society based on the goal of economic empowerment, especially for the underprivileged. Our Pro-Poor Agenda is therefore designed to give power to the people, promote economic diversification, protect sustainable peace and encourage good governance. We appeal to our friends, bilateral partners and private investors to support the Agenda.\nAs we focus on action plans to implement our development Agenda, we are acutely aware of the vulnerability of our youthful population, who are clearly disadvantaged as a result of high unemployment and a lack of access to quality educational opportunities. Our plan is to reverse their unfortunate situation and help them become productive citizens through the provision of adequate educational facilities at the high-school and college levels for those who remain interested in pursuing academic programmes. For  those youths left behind due to the disastrous civil crisis and who have outgrown their  school  years,  my  Government is investing in technical vocational education and training programmes to build their entrepreneurial and marketable skillsets.\nConscious of the importance and impact of infrastructure on social and economic development, my Government has identified investment in roads, energy and ports as our key priority, and is therefore soliciting funding and other technical expertise to undertake\nthose projects in pursuit of our goal to connect our cities and towns and power our economy.\nAgriculture, Liberia\u2019s  comparative  advantage, has also been identified as one of our major poverty- alleviation instruments, since it can lead us to self- sufficiency in food production and self-employment, as well as open doors to industrialization. With the implementation of a new special economic zone, we intend to attract labour-intensive light manufacturing.\nDrawing on the experience of the 2014 Ebola epidemic, which took the lives of thousands of Liberians and health workers, we intend to efficiently and properly organize our health-care delivery system, to ensure that the health and well-being of our people is improved.\nFinally, we are placing emphasis on national security in order to enable our people to move and  live freely without fear. With the recent withdrawal of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), we are now in charge of our own security. We thank the international community for the sacrifices made in securing and maintaining the peace in Liberia after our protracted civil conflict. In that regard, I would like  to express my personal appreciation to Mr. Farid Zarif of Afghanistan, who, as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Liberia and the last Head of UNMIL, from 2015 to 2018, supervised the orderly withdrawal of troops, while simultaneously securing the peaceful environment that allowed a very robust political campaign to take place without incident.\nMy country has finally turned the corner, having now experienced more years of peace than the preceding years of war, guided by our Peace Agreement, signed in Accra 15 years ago. We thank the members and the Security Council for the UNMIL peacekeeping mission, which brought stability and helped us rebuild our institutions and communities. We are a peacekeeping success story, and we are grateful for the support we were given.\nBut a nation that has experienced civil war must never take peace for granted or forget the long shadow that years of conflict still cast  over  people\u2019s  lives. We must realize and appreciate that ours is still a fragile peace.\nOur people across the country still bear the scars of conflict. We therefore intend to initiate a series of national peace dialogues throughout Liberia. We must\n \nrelaunch those difficult conversations at the local  level and include our youth, so that they, and we, do not repeat the costly mistakes of the past. It is clear to me that such frank exchanges are an essential step in bringing lasting healing, reconciliation and unity to our people. Our agenda is not one of division, but rather one that intends to provide an enabling environment for a united and reconciled people to be able to benefit and prosper from the economic dividends of peace.\nI recall with humility that I was once selected to serve as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, a mission that I undertook with passion, conviction and commitment to support and inform the world about principles for which this Organization stands. I was also privileged to be appointed as Messenger of Peace for Liberia, a mandate to apply these principles: preserving and maintaining peace, which the peacekeeping mission had so successful restored. I deeply and personally cherish those principles.\nTherefore, today, in concluding, I wish to reaffirm the support of my Government for the work of the United Nations in striving to achieve global peace, counter terrorism and reform the United Nations, as well as to achieve reform, security, good governance and the advancement of the principle of universal human rights. We further reiterate  our  commitment to the rule of law, the alleviation of poverty, gender equality, the elimination of gender-based violence and the empowerment of women, girls and young people. I also believe that the overwhelming mandate I received from the Liberian people is one to end corruption in the public service, and I remain fully committed to that task.\nWith the generous assistance and strong support of the United Nations, as well as that of other international institutions and Member States, and with God\u2019s blessing, we will fulfil our agenda to lift our people out of poverty to prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of Ukraine, I congratulate the President on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We support the outlined priorities and are ready to do our part in translating them into reality.\nOur deliberations are taking place at a defining moment for the United Nations. Despite the universal\nappeal for peace and a declared commitment to upholding it, wars and armed conflicts remain our reality. Conflicts are the main reason for the increase in number of refugees and displaced persons worldwide \u2014 to the unprecedented figure of 65.5 million. Since no peace means no development, hundreds of millions are doomed to misery.\nThe international security environment seemed rock solid less than two decades ago. It has now descended into a volatile and increasingly disturbing state of affairs, where both traditional and hybrid threats challenge the stability of our societies. Too often, lofty rhetoric on peace, respect for international law and commitment to human rights remains precisely that: rhetoric \u2014 nice sounding words and politically correct messages that are not backed by concrete action.\nWe may be tempted to talk about achievements or grand plans for the future, yet, from our perspective,  it is much more important to address the fundamental problems faced by the United Nations and the international community as a whole. We will never forget that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Organization is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\nUnfortunately, my fellow citizens have become part of that  one  fifth  of  the  world  population  that is experiencing the horrors of war. As I deliver my address, reports have brought the sad news of another human life lost on the front lines of a war that has been inflicted on my country by a permanent member of the Security Council. Yesterday and the day before, several families were again struck by grief as their loved ones perished as a result of Russia\u2019s hostile attacks. Moscow turns Ukrainians into orphans, it tortures our patriots in its prisons, and more than 1.5 million people have become internally displaced persons who still cannot return to their homes.\nRussia continues to multiply the human tragedy, which recently took on a new dimension: ecological. It is poisoning Ukrainian soil and causing environmental disasters, not only in occupied  Crimea  but  also  in the Donbas region. That has been a daily reality for Ukrainians for four years now: thousands of deaths, destruction, displacement and human suffering. For my fellow citizens, those years have been a tremendous challenge and a test of their determination, solidarity, resilience and faith.\nLet us not forget what this war is about. Ukraine made a sovereign decision to live on its own terms and\n \npromote a freer world based on democratic values and rules. Russia is punishing Ukraine for  that decision.  It kills, destroys homes, and tells lies on a massive scale. It claims that Ukraine and Georgia have attacked themselves. Do we know which one of Russia\u2019s neighbours will be the next to attack itself, or will countries around the world be comfortably numb in the hope that they will not be next?\nAs we defend Ukraine\u2019s land and our freedom of choice, and as we counter the resurgent neo-imperialist Power that is willing to divide the world anew, we are also defending the free world. The United Nations should not remain silent while the values and principles rooted in its Charter, as well as the entire body of international law, are being violated by a country with the veto power. This is not just a challenge, but a chance to make the United Nations relevant and the motto of this session of the General Assembly work.\nHow did such a deterioration in world affairs  come about? Many assume that respect for peace and international law is a constant given.  Developments on the international stage over the past decade have seriously undermined such confidence. Appeasement and quick  fixes  to  difficult  problems  have  proved to be false options. It has been proved that staying comfortably silent when international norms are breached does nothing but encourage the offender to continue its destructive policies. The world\u2019s silence is exactly what the Kremlin weaponizes against Ukraine and, ultimately, against all of us.\nIt is naive to believe that safe shores will always be found. There will be no safe shores if we allow someone to feel that he or she will not be bound by any norms  or restrictions, that he or she has a right to reshape the international system to his or her  liking, or  that his  or her interests are more legitimate than ours. In the absence of a strong and united reaction, an extremely irresponsible and selfish actor resorts to the tactic of further escalation, which creates new crises, raises the stakes, and blackmails other countries and even entire international organizations \u2014 all in an effort to get away with murder. We shall not allow this to happen. We will put the world back on track.\nWhat is the cure? In a word, it is responsibility. The ability of the international community to ensure systemic and unerring responsibility for each and every violation of international law \u2014 including, first and foremost, the norms and principles of the Charter of\nthe United Nations \u2014 is the benchmark measuring how successful we as a family of nations can be in achieving our shared goals. Ensuring responsibility is never an easy feat. Let me be absolutely clear on the following point: nothing will stop Moscow from continuing its aggressive, expansionist policies  if  it  does  not  face a united stand by the international community and punishment for its actions does not become inevitable. It is due to the lack of relevant punishment that after Georgia came Ukraine, after Litvinenko came the Skripals and after Aleppo came Idlib.\nThe Kremlin has no intention of stopping. Following the occupation of Crimea, it now aims to occupy the Sea of Azov, situated between Ukraine and Russia, and, having illegally constructed a bridge across the Kerch Strait, Russia launched its systematic disruption of Ukrainian and foreign ships and the freedom of international navigation through the Strait. Such brutal actions must be rejected as illegal, including under  the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. They require a strong response, including an enhanced sanctions policy and other targeted measures.\nThe efficiency of international actions often falls short of expectations, and the relevance of the United Nations itself is called into question. We must admit that the responsibility for resolving the current state  of affairs rests on all of us, both collectively and individually. If we are committed to building peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, we must protect the Charter of the United Nations, uphold its norms and principles and take resolute action to restore justice.\nLet me put it more precisely: the beautiful language of the Charter is worth nothing if it is not  enforced. No more words are needed; it is the time for deeds. The United Nations must gain momentum, as there are continued attempts to ruin the rules-based international order and forcefully revise internationally recognized State borders. That dangerous slide towards a world with no civilized rules must be stopped. In that regard, there is a need to revitalize and strengthen the role of the General Assembly in the area of international peace and security.\nWith conflicts spreading, we must ensure the maximum flexibility and comprehensiveness when it comes to the agenda of the General Assembly, which is the only inclusive and the chief policymaking forum. That is why Ukraine introduced to the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly the item entitled\n \n\u201cThe situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine\u201d. Member States should be provided with every possibility for in-depth considerations of all urgent situations that require the attention of the international community. As outlined by the President of the General Assembly, we have to facilitate quick and effective responses to emergency situations by the General Assembly. As one of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, Ukraine stands ready to contribute to that.\nAs Member States, we conferred on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. What should we do if a veto-holding member of the Security Council uses that right to veto in order to help itself escape from responsibility, rather than to help international peace and stability? It is time to say that the abuse of the right to veto is a constraint that often prevents our Organization from acting. We believe that progress on the reform of the Security Council will be an important contribution to the ongoing broader change at the United Nations. We support launching text-based talks within intergovernmental negotiations and are ready to engage constructively in that process.\nWe also expect that the ongoing reform of the peace and security pillar, which was envisaged by the Secretary-General with the support of the General Assembly, will contribute  to  the  speed  and  ability of  the Organization to react to the emerging threats  to international peace and security. Ukraine fully shares the approach of the Secretary-General to the peacekeeping  activity  of  the  Organization  under his Action for Peacekeeping concept. It is a timely opportunity for Member States and the United Nations leadership to consider measures leading to effective and real changes to United Nations peacekeeping. That is the same peacekeeping that Ukraine has been asking the United Nations to deploy to its territory since April 2015, when I addressed my request, with the support of the Parliament of Ukraine, to the President of the Security Council, the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General.\nAfter the failure of the United Nations in preventing aggression against Ukraine, we still hoped that the Organization would help to settle the conflict by deploying a United Nations-mandated multinational peacekeeping force to the occupied Donbas region. We hoped for a mission with a strong mandate and broad responsibilities to help bring peace back to Ukrainian\nsoil, rather than freeze the conflict or cement the presence of the aggressor and its proxies in Donbas. We firmly count on further progress on that important issue. After all \u2014 and perfectly in line with the theme for this general debate, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people\u201d \u2014 it is through Security Council-mandated peacekeeping operations that the United Nations can save countless lives and prevent further suffering.\nWe remain as determined as ever to continue to defend every inch of our territory against aggression. At the same time, we will continue to explore all available means to end the conflict peacefully and restore the territorial integrity of my country. Let me stress that Ukraine has always put first legal and diplomatic means of conflict resolution. We have prioritized multilateralism by turning to support from the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe, as well as other international organizations, forums and mechanisms. We will continue along that path. Moscow will feel the strength of the rule of international law.\nWe have initiated several legal cases against the Russian side in international courts. We have already achieved important results in some of those cases. In particular, at the beginning of 2017, the International Court of Justice ordered Russia to lift the ban on the activities of the Mejlis \u2014 the representative body of Crimean Tatars in occupied Crimea. However, Russia continues to ignore that ruling, demonstrating its disregard not only for its international obligations but also for the Court.\nAnother important element of  our  case  before the International Court of Justice is the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, in the year 2014, and the role of the Russian Federation in that tragedy. It is important that Australia and the Netherlands recently joined Ukraine in its efforts to bring Russia to account. The international community has repeatedly called on Russia to acknowledge its responsibility and change its destructive behaviour in Ukraine and elsewhere. We know that following the legal pathway is a lengthy process, but we are confident that it will allow us to achieve justice in the end.\nIt has been almost four years since Russia\u2019s attempted annexation and illegal occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol. Under Russian occupation, Crimea has become a military stronghold, threatening the security and stability of the entire Black Sea region.\n \nWe believe that the increasing militarization of Crimea deserves the General Assembly\u2019s close attention and prompt reaction. Russia\u2019s aggressive policies and arrogance in using lethal weapons multiply that threat. In that regard, Ukraine is counting on the active support of the General Assembly to implement the relevant resolutions during this session.\nSince the first day of the illegal occupation of Crimea, Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians have faced repression and discrimination. There are many cases of murder, torture, harassment and arrest on fabricated charges. The list of hostages and victims owing to  the  Russian occupation regime in Crimea  is growing longer by the day. Being of Ukrainian or Crimean identity seems to be a criminal offence in today\u2019s reality on the occupied peninsula.\nA Crimean farmer, Volodymyr Balukh, was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for raising a Ukrainian flag over his private residence. Crimean film director Oleg Sentsov remains behind bars in a remote penal colony in northern Russia, serving a 20-year prison term on fabricated charges. Both Oleg and Volodymyr are hanging in the balance between life and death as they remain on hunger strike. I highly appreciate the  extraordinary  manifestation of support and unity throughout the world in seeking the freedom of those  brave  people.  Unfortunately, the Kremlin remains blind and deaf to those appeals from the international community and from many of Russia\u2019s intellectuals. I call on States Members of the United Nations to strengthen their efforts in demanding respect for human rights in the temporarily occupied Crimea by adopting the relevant General Assembly draft resolutions.\nThere are also dozens of Ukrainians being held  by the occupiers in the Donbas region since the start of the Russian aggression in 2014. Ukrainian soldier Serhii Glondar has never seen his youngest daughter, as he has been held captive for three-and-a-half years. All Ukrainian proposals to exchange Russian citizens convicted of crimes against our sovereignty and territorial integrity for the Ukrainian citizens being held as political prisoners by the Kremlin remain unanswered.\nThat is  just  another  side  of  Russia\u2019s recklessness \u2014 first sending and inciting its own citizens into this war and then simply abandoning them afterwards. That is the thing about today\u2019s Russia:\nit absolutely does not care. It does not care about suffering. It does not care about truth. It does not care about the law. It thinks that its military might and status at the United Nations gives it that right. It is up to us to prove it wrong. It is up to us to make it care. Otherwise, what is the point of us being here? What would be the difference between the era before the United Nations and that with the United Nations?\nIn a broader context, Ukraine  has always considered the protection of human rights as one of the cornerstones of United Nations activities. Sustainable peace and security cannot be achieved in isolation from human rights. We therefore support the efforts to bring back human rights issues to the Security Council and promote close cooperation among all the relevant United Nations bodies in that area.\nMy country is delivering on its commitments under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. Ukraine\u2019s economy grew in the second quarter of 2018 at an annual rate of\n3.8 per cent. That marks the tenth consecutive quarter of growth, which is clearly a sustainable trend. The increase in gross domestic product (GDP) was helped by macroeconomic stabilization, an improved investment climate and a clean-up of the banking sector. Ukraine is demonstrating the best dynamics of growth among the emerging markets. Despite heavy security and defence expenses, totalling more than 6 per cent of its GDP, Ukraine is undergoing fundamental transformations on social, economic and political tracks.\nWe have consistently implemented progressive reforms, ranging in areas from the judiciary, education, health care and public administration to carrying out decentralization and fighting corruption. During the period 2019-2021, Ukraine will take on an important responsibility as a member of the Economic and Social Council. Based on its extensive  recent  experience, my country looks forward to using its membership to strengthen the role of the Economic and Social Council in following up and reviewing the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, with particular regard to conflict and post-conflict settings.\nAmong the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, Ukraine particularly welcomes the United Nations initiatives aimed at reducing global hunger. Today, with more than 850 million people  starving around the world, my country cannot stand idle and is ready  to offer its help to the world in addressing the issue of\n \nfood security. Ukraine knows the cost of that tragedy like no one else. In November, we will mark the eighty- fifth anniversary of one of the deadliest crimes of the twentieth century \u2014 that of the Holodomor, which saw mass starvation in Ukraine, artificially  created by the Stalinist regime. It took the lives of several million Ukrainians. In that regard, I would like to renew my appeal to the Assembly to mark one of the greatest tragedies in human history by adopting a dedicated declaration.\nOur Organization is only as strong as we  want and allow it to be. Therefore, our full support and strong political will are required to ensure that the United Nations remains relevant in today\u2019s uncertain and turbulent times, and relevant, as is rightly stated in the theme of  this general debate, to all people. It    is our mission and shared responsibility to empower the United Nations to do what is expected of the Organization and to do it through our global leadership based on the shared values of freedom, the rule of law and tolerance.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to begin by congratulating Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. It is a great pleasure to see a woman presiding over the Assembly. I want to assure her of our full support and cooperation and wish her every success in carrying out her noble duty. I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k on his successful completion of his tenure as President of the Assembly at its seventy-second session.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which promises to leave no one behind, encompasses all of the prerequisites for building a peaceful and prosperous world. In order  to  meet  the  lofty  goals of the 2030 Agenda, national Governments and the international community have to work hand in hand for its implementation. That requires international peace and security, which creates an environment conducive to economic growth and social progress while enhancing international cooperation and assistance, with priority given to the most vulnerable groups of countries, which are the least-developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries and small island developing States.\nSoon after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in order to realize it and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic incorporated the SDG targets into its eighth national five-year socioeconomic development plan, for the period from 2016 to 2020. Given our specific needs, we have gone the extra mile by adopting a national sustainable  development  goal  18,  \u201cLives  safe   from\n \nunexploded ordnance\u201d, in order to address the problems caused by unexploded ordnance.\nAt the High-level Political Forum in July, the Lao Government presented its first voluntary national review on SDG implementation, which has seen important progress and emerging constraints in the past few years. While we have seen positive momentum towards achieving the SDGs, bringing us closer to graduation from our LDC status, we remain vulnerable to external shocks. This year we have been witnessing an increasing intensity in climate change and natural disasters, causing heavy losses and damage to the lives and property of people in various parts of the world. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is no exception. We have been severely affected by natural disasters, especially extensive flooding across the country, the worst-ever natural disaster in our history. To date 2,409 of 8,464 villages in 115 of 148 districts have been affected by massive flooding. The exact costs of the losses and damage are as yet unknown, as a post- disaster needs assessment will be conducted in the next few months. The calamity has had a severe impact on the livelihoods of people in the affected areas.\nWith the assistance of friendly countries and international organizations, including international non-governmental organizations and individuals, the Lao Government has been providing those affected with emergency relief in the form of temporary shelters, food and health care. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to the friendly countries and international organizations that have given us valuable assistance during this difficult time.\nAgainst that backdrop, it is more crucial than ever for world leaders to honour their commitments pledged under the Paris Agreement. Within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), great importance has been accorded to the  issue  of  climate  change and disaster-risk management. We also very much appreciate the continued support of the United Nations for the ASEAN-United Nations Joint Strategic Plan of Action on Disaster Management, for the period from 2016 to 2020, which is designed to address climate change and disaster management and respond to the effects of the changing climate on socioeconomic development in years to come.\nAddressing the scourge of transnational crime requires concerted effort at all levels. In that context,\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic remains seriously committed to working closely with the international community on the fight against illicit drugs, the illegal trade in wildlife and trafficking in persons, among other things. The Government has adopted a drug- control master plan for the period from 2016 to 2020, as we implement the ASEAN Work Plan on Securing Communities against Illicit Drugs for the period from 2016 to 2025 so as to realize the vision of a drug-free ASEAN as one of the region\u2019s high-priority agenda items. We are also pleased to support the Global Call to Action on the World Drug Problem initiated by the President of the United States.\nThe Lao Government has spared no effort in combating the heinous and inhumane crime of human trafficking by adopting various laws, regulations and national action plans to combat trafficking in persons and by becoming a signatory to numerous regional agreements and memorandums of understanding, including the ASEAN Convention against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which seek to prevent and combat human trafficking.\nThe United Nations needs to be strengthened so that it can respond effectively to the challenges we face today. We are pleased with the Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives on reforming and repositioning the United Nations, with the aim of improving the  capacity of  the United Nations to meet the needs in the current environment. In that context, we reiterate our view that development issues must remain a core and integral part of the United Nations and its States Members and a top priority for them, alongside the promotion of international peace, security and human rights and an emphasis on the importance of enhancing the United Nations system\u2019s ability to deliver on its mandate.\nWe are concerned about the continued decline in contributions to the core funding of United Nations development agencies and the United Nations Development Programme on the ground. My delegation would therefore like to call once again on donor countries and development partners to fulfil their official development assistance commitment of at least\n0.7 per cent of their gross national income.\nWe all acknowledge that peace and security are prerequisites for the socioeconomic development of all nations. We must therefore maintain and promote peace and security at all costs. Past experience has shown that settling disputes by peaceful means is the best way to\n \nensure the durable peace that is essential for a nation\u2019s sustainable development. Accordingly, it is incumbent on the international community to continue to build mutual trust and confidence in an effort to jointly overcome their current challenges and seek peaceful solutions to the disputes and conflicts that we are witnessing in various regions of the world.\nAgainst that backdrop, we welcomed the recent historic summit in June between the leaders of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States of America, which constituted an important milestone in the relations between the two countries. We also welcomed the third summit between the leaders of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, with the objective of striving not only to improve bilateral relations between the two countries but also to address the issue of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We hope that such positive momentum will be strengthened, thereby contributing to the maintenance of peace and stability and denuclearization in the region as a whole.\nDespite those positive developments on the Korean peninsula, my delegation is concerned about the lack of progress on the Palestinian question. We hope that its long-overdue resolution can be achieved by peaceful means with the goal of arriving at a two-State solution whereby Palestine and Israel can live side by side in peace and security within internationally recognized borders, in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nOn another note, in an era of interdependence, international cooperation and engagement are key factors to peaceful and mutually beneficial coexistence. Enforced isolation and the  imposition  of  sanctions on any country will not necessarily benefit the international community. On the contrary, it will result in losses for all and increased hostility. My delegation therefore urges for an end to the embargo on Cuba.  We also want to call on the international community  to uphold and further strengthen multilateralism that promotes cooperation rather than confrontation, which remains one of the core values of our only universal organization, the United Nations.\nI would like to conclude by expressing my support for the theme of the seventy-third session of the General Assembly \u2014 \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d \u2014 which is indeed pertinent to the current global situation and the work of the United Nations. However, making all internationally agreed goals and commitments a reality requires strong political will and firm commitment and support to multilateralism, particularly in terms  of making the United  Nations  stronger  so  that  it  can effectively serve and respond to the needs of all Member States."

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me join all those who have preceded\n \nme at this rostrum in conveying, on behalf of the Government and the people of Sao Tome and Principe, our sincere condolences to the Government and the people of Indonesia, as well as the families affected  by the earthquake that happened recently in that friendly country.\nIt is with a great sense of honour and satisfaction that I address the General Assembly for the first time as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Communities of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. It is with great pleasure that I address my first words to Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, whom I congratulate on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, and to whom I express our support for the course of her term, which we believe will be very successful. We note that she is only the fourth woman to undertake this noble function, and we hope that those numbers will increase in the future in the name of the greater inclusion of women in  positions  of  importance  in the Organization.\nI also congratulate the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, on conducting the work of the previous session of the General Assembly judiciously, zealously and selflessly in an extremely difficult international context.\nI also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the memory of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who passed away in August. He was a man who dedicated his life to making the world a more peaceful place and worked tirelessly for that purpose, and always with a great sense of our humanity. We must preserve his legacy by continuing to strengthen our Organization as the ultimate and overall guarantor of the quest for peaceful, durable and consensus solutions, legitimized by international law, in order to achieve the desired goals of peace, security, stability and progress for all.\nWe welcome the choice of the theme for this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. Our Organization is indeed facing very complex challenges, for which it is called to provide effective, concrete and comprehensive responses that are  truly  relevant  to all people.\nLet us emphasize the issue of migration, on which the global leadership of the United Nations must constantly foster dialogue among nations seeking\nglobal solutions, promoting concerted policies to host refugees and supporting their countries of origin to better address this global problem, which often has devastating consequences for those who, in their quest for better living conditions, are exposed to flagrant injustices everywhere.\nIf we really want peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, our efforts must persist in search of solutions not only to those problems but also in negotiating to mitigate the effects of the armed conflicts raging throughout the world and to prevent the emergence and escalation of regional tensions, which can in turn generate others. We therefore strongly appeal from this rostrum for ongoing dialogue aimed at peacefully resolving the tensions that we are seeing all over the planet and the conflicts that continue to claim thousands of innocent lives, especially in Syria. We also continue to call for an understanding to be reached in the Central African Republic so that negotiations can put  an end to a conflict that has harmed thousands of people in a country where the refugee situation has led to a serious humanitarian crisis.\nWe warmly commend our sister Republic of Guinea-Bissau for scheduling legislative elections for November and express our hope for their success, as we are certain that they will mark a new era of harmony and prosperity, along with a resumption of the regular functioning of its democratic institutions. We also commend the Democratic Republic of the Congo for scheduling general elections in December and sincerely hope that they will be free, transparent and fair and held in a peaceful and harmonious environment.\nWe are also pleased to note the positive steps in the reconciliation process between Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as among the warring parties in the Republic of South Sudan, and we strongly encourage them to continue on that path.\nWith regard to the situation in the Sahara, we express our support for the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy in their efforts to relaunch the political process on a basis of the parameters set by the Security Council in 2007, and we welcome the Council\u2019s adoption of its resolution 2414 (2018), which calls for efforts to achieve a political, pragmatic, realistic and enduring solution to the dispute. We also congratulate Morocco on its serious and credible efforts to find a political and definitive solution to the region\u2019s issues, and we support its initiative in favour of autonomy.\n \nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe welcomes the historic developments on the Korean peninsula and calls on all those involved to continue the dialogue and negotiations in the interests of all the parties concerned, with a view to achieving the development of the entire region.\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, we call for dialogue and a continuation of efforts to find a peaceful and negotiated solution, respecting the right of the Palestinian people to decide their own destiny, in accordance with the fundamental principles of international law.\nAlong those same lines, we renew our call for continued efforts to be made to normalize relations between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America so that we can see the trade embargo that has been an obstacle to the progress of that friendly country for decades lifted as soon as possible.\nUnfortunately, we must once again express our regret that terrorist acts continue to claim so many lives around the world. We will always firmly and vehemently condemn such heinous acts, which show no respect for human life, will always earn our firmest and most vehement condemnation. We also want to take this opportunity to condemn once again the terrorist acts of Boko Haram on the territory of our neighbour and brother the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Their harmful consequences continue to undermine the development and security of the entire Gulf of Guinea region. Likewise, we strongly condemn the terrorist acts that have caused so much suffering to the martyred peoples of the Sahel region, and in particular those of Mali, the Niger and Burkina Faso. We reaffirm the strong commitment of the Democratic Republic  of Sao Tome and Principe to actively collaborating with its regional and international partners in all initiatives aimed at eradicating this problem from our societies. Only by acting together can we truly build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, as the theme of this session suggests.\nThe leadership role of our Organization undoubtedly goes hand in hand with actions that bring together efforts to combat climate change. We are confronted every day with the devastating effects of climate change around the world. Natural disasters are occurring on an increasingly broad scale and with growing intensity, leading to loss of life, especially in the least developed regions of the world. Global efforts must continue\nunder the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and they must be a shared responsibility for everyone, because it is up to all of us to safeguard the future for coming generations.\nAt the beginning of my statement, I alluded to the most recent tragic example of the effects of climate change in Indonesia. It is therefore urgent to implement the provisions of the Paris Agreement, so that the necessary technical, financial and human resources are properly directed towards the immensity of the task at hand. We therefore hope that the forthcoming twenty- forth session of the Conference of the Parties, to be held in Katowice, Poland, will be very successful and that the dialogue there will in fact make it possible to implement the Agreement. Sao Tome and Principe will do everything in its power to advocate for the crucial importance of shared and universal efforts to adopt the necessary policies in that regard.\nWe also want to underline our support for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), whose achievement will  truly  benefit  the  whole  world. The support of all the specialized agencies of the United Nations will be required for formulating and implementing the policies necessary for the achievement of the SDGs. Sao Tome and Principe would like to point out that we have been putting this type of collaboration into practice in our country.\nWe also want to highlight and welcome the continued efforts of the African Union to implement its inclusive Agenda 2063, whose achievement, we believe, will enable African countries to  throw  off the chains of poverty, thereby bringing their peoples a better future. The spirit that has guided us this far must continue to be strengthened, taking into account our particular specificities and constantly keeping in mind what unites us, which is the quest for the well-being and development of the whole of Africa.\nSao Tome and Principe, a small developing island State, with all the constraints that this condition entails, is pursuing a policy adapted to its realities while maintaining respect for its multicultural diversity and human rights. With an economy that is very vulnerable to external shocks, the current Government has designed and is working to achieve an ambitious transformation agenda by 2030, closely following the guidelines of both the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063.\n \nIt has been a difficult task, but we would like to put on record the support that we have received from organizations that have closely collaborated with the Government and our important bilateral partners, whose support the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe sincerely acknowledges. Since our task  is still ongoing, we would very much appreciate being able to continue to count on those contributions.\nOn 7 October, Sao Tome and Principe will hold legislative, local and regional elections. We invite the international community as independent observers to join us once again in witnessing the strength, quality and maturity of our democracy, which the elections will further consolidate.\nThe United Nations must assume its role as a leader in the global efforts to bring development to all peoples, in the unceasing pursuit of peaceful solutions to the ongiong conflicts in the world, in combating climate change, reducing inequalities, promoting gender equality and equity, fighting the scourge of terrorism and hatred based on race, sexual orientation and religious beliefs, promoting intercultural dialogue among peoples, and in the uncompromising defence of peace and human rights. These values, which we are certain we all share, must be continually upheld, and all our efforts must be conducive to their protection and reinforcement in a spirit of frank and open dialogue that benefits all.\nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe also maintains and reaffirms its unequivocal commitment to the ideals of peace and fraternity among peoples, and will always strive for close collaboration in our efforts to identify shared responsibilities and find common solutions to our common problems, with a view to building more prosperous, peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, pursuant to  the  ideals  of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "I am  particularly honoured to address this year\u2019s session, as 2018 is a symbolic year for Romania. One hundred years ago, Romanians accomplished their great dream, that of living together in one united country. The centenary of a united and modern Romania is not only about my country\u2019s past but, even more, about the future. My strong conviction is that a safer and prosperous future for the Romanian people can be accomplished only alongside peaceful and sustainable societies all over the world.\nThe United Nations, too, has reasons to celebrate this year. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is turning 70 years old, and so is the  International Law Commission, the main United Nations body responsible for shaping international law in order for the international community to become a better place where international rule of law governs us all.\nSuch anniversaries are a reminder of our political determination to stand up for our fundamental rights and the law, although the road has neither been short nor easy. Our action as political leaders is driven by a responsibility towards our people. We serve our people when working with the United Nations, and each and every citizen needs to see a concrete impact on his or her daily life and a positive change. I therefore welcome the invitation of the President of the General Assembly to comment on the continuing relevance of the United Nations for the lives and well-being of all peoples. We have to explain the current challenges to peace, equity and sustainability of our societies and speak more about the role of the United Nations in addressing them. We must explain that we face serious threats to security, that terrorism needs a globally coordinated response and that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery remain existential threats to global security. Pointing them out is necessary, but not enough. We need to address them by coming up with clear solutions. Romania is working in that respect in its region. Unfortunately, there are unresolved conflicts in the wider Black Sea area that pose serious threats to the region itself and to international security.\nThree years ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2014 a unique universal agenda\n \nfor progress \u2014 and set 17 ambitious goals that have a significant impact on the most pressing challenges in the everyday lives of our people. Romania, like many other countries, is in a learning process. One very useful exercise was the presentation of our national voluntary review at the High-level Political Forum in July. At  the same time, we have a lot to share from our own experience. Therefore, in April 2019, in partnership with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Romania will host a regional conference on the theme \u201cThe 2030 Agenda: Partnerships for Sustainable Development\u201d. The countries of our region will have a chance to share good practices and lessons learned in the process of implementing the 2030 Agenda and in identifying strategic opportunities for addressing key social drivers in our region, as well as looking at areas of sustainability and common interest.\nFrom another perspective, we are satisfied with our joint efforts to prepare for the adoption of some very important international cooperative frameworks by the end of 2018. The global compacts on refugees and regular migration will generate a common approach on migration and displaced persons at  the global level. In addition, negotiations on a global pact for the environment are about to start. The development of the convention on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction is in progress. Another Ocean Conference will take place soon. It will be aimed at continuing engagement for safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed oceans at the global level. In addition, the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  and the Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism remain paramount.\nThe list of achievements with a direct impact on our lives does not stop there, as we do not stop making progress in our work together at the United Nations. And I believe that we can do more. We still have to work on making the whole United Nations system, including the Security Council, truly coordinated, efficient, effective, transparent, accountable and fit for the realities of the international community of the twenty- first century. The next few months will be  decisive  for United Nations reform. The implementation of the framework put in place as a result of the tireless work of the Secretary-General, with the support of the Member States, will reflect the level of political determination of each country. Romania will continue to  support that effort.\nAs the next President of the Council of the European Union, in the first half of 2019, Romania is determined to strengthen the European Union-United Nations partnership. And when I speak about engagement I do not just mean politicians and diplomats. We must reach out to our young people, representatives of civil society, journalists and business people. We need them all for the cause of multilateralism and global leadership.\nAs the Assembly knows, Romania is running for  a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the term 2020-2021. Through that candidature, we take our share of responsibility in the attempt to increase the effectiveness of the Council. We hope that our track record within the United Nations will convince the Assembly once again that Romania is committed to supporting the United Nations work for peace and development for all its Members. Peace, development and justice are foundational pillars in our multilateral strategy. We respect our partners and rely on dialogue. We count on members\u2019 most valuable support for our candidature. Romania will be a responsible partner in promoting a common United Nations agenda.\nWe have recognized  the  primary  responsibility of the Security Council for international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. As many crises today are multidimensional in nature, the Security Council could play a more prominent role in addressing more aspects that impact peace and security.  For  example,  climate  change has become one of  the  toughest  global  challenges. Its consequences \u2014 be they water shortages, food insecurity, the displacement of people or rising sea levels \u2014 threaten lives all around the world. In addition to the efforts of other United Nations platforms to tackle climate-related risks, the Security Council could create a framework to address them in an integrated manner.\nWe welcomed the  organization  of  a  debate  in the Security Council in July on aspects of peace and security related to climate change (see  S/PV.8307), and we are ready to follow up on  the topic if elected  as a non-permanent member. Ahead of the preparation of the Secretary-General\u2019s climate summit next year, during its presidency of the Council of the European Union Romania will host an international conference on the theme \u201cBuilding resilience to natural disasters\u201d, as a platform to exchange views on how to assess and more effectively address climate-related security risks and enhance the basis for a resilient future.\n \nI thank the President of  the  General  Assembly for the theme she chose for this year\u2019s debate and congratulate her on the important responsibilities she has assumed. Let me extend our best wishes of success and assure her of the full cooperation of Romania.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to extend the usual warm greetings from the Government and the people of Grenada, on whose behalf I am privileged to address this noble Organization and its Members.\nI join previous speakers in congratulating the President on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I am confident of her stewardship and assure her of my delegation\u2019s cooperation and support. I am also  pleased  to  join my colleagues in  thanking  the  outgoing  President  of  the Assembly  at   its   seventy-second   session, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his able and focused leadership. I must also congratulate and thank Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his leadership of the United Nations, and express our deep gratitude, especially for the keen interest he has shown in dealing with the development challenges facing small island developing States.\nThe Government and people of Grenada join others around the world in mourning the passing of the late\n \nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Mr. Annan, who served the United  Nations  with distinction, was a consummate diplomat and international statesman who resolutely defended the ideals of international peace and security. The former Secretary-General  was a humanitarian who worked tirelessly to ensure that disadvantaged persons around the world were afforded their human rights. His wise and courageous leadership helped place the issue of sustainable development on the international agenda through the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs have since evolved into the Sustainable Development Goals, another globally agreed framework designed to advance the international development agenda.\nWe are acutely aware of how critical development issues are for small island developing States like Grenada, and we are indebted to Kofi Annan for initiating and spearheading that historic global movement. Today, as we mourn his loss, we are comforted by the fact that his legacy will continue to inspire generations of leaders around the world. There is one particular quote from our brother Kofi that resonates deeply and is very relevant to the theme of this year\u2019s session. He said,\n\u201cTo live is to choose. But  to  choose  well, you must know who you are and what you stand for, where you want to go and why you  want to  get there.\u201d\nAs States Members of this noble Organization, we must deliberately choose to make the United Nations relevant to all peoples. We must also choose a deliberate path to global leadership that promotes shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. Grenada also joins the rest of the United Nations community in honouring the late South African hero and international statesman, Nelson Mandela, on the centenary of his birth. This tribute comes at a time when the international community is looking to leaders who understand the necessity of fostering international solidarity and cooperation, leaders who bring people together and make sacrifices for the  greater  good. The global community has no better example of that than the late great Madiba. It is our hope that leaders everywhere will work diligently to uphold his staunch legacy of promoting peace, equality and human dignity.\nThis  session  of  the  Assembly  is  taking  place in a global context characterized by changing political, ideological and religious tensions, social revolution  and  an increasing anxiety about economic,\nsocial and political inequality and marginalization. Those  global  changes are   magnified,   especially for developing States, in the face of challenging phenomena such as climate change, natural disasters and non-communicable diseases. With limited access to development financing, those challenges are further exacerbated. Pursuing policies and strategies for confronting those challenges, with the corresponding extraordinary solutions, is the path we must follow in order to secure more sustainable societies.\nWe are well into the 2018 hurricane season and yet the Caribbean is still recovering from that of 2017, one of the most devastating hurricane seasons the world has seen. We have been holding our breath as this year\u2019s various tropical systems \u2014 Beryl, Isaac and just this week, Kirk \u2014 take aim at our region. Such weather systems are yet another reminder of the vulnerability of our region and the realities of climate change, capable of eviscerating entire industries in a matter of hours. That is especially evident in our region, which is heavily dependent on agriculture and tourism, and where any damage to property or infrastructure is significant.\nYet  there  is  hope.  Too  often   we   talk  about the disadvantages of small nations. The global climate-change challenge offers us an opportunity not only to highlight our vulnerability but also  to  focus on the distinct advantages of being small States. The Caribbean and other small island developing States can serve as proving grounds for the nationwide implementation of climate-related technologies and advances. We also represent some of the most globally compelling business cases for sustainable and renewable energy investment.\nBeing climate-smart goes beyond policies.  It goes beyond resilient housing, infrastructure and agriculture. It means that the region  can also  serve  as a global beacon for renewable energy and energy efficiency. We aim to be resilient, and with our region\u2019s tremendous potential in hydroelectricity and geothermal energy, we could also be  climate-smart. In understanding the need to rethink our adaptation  to climate change, the Government of Grenada has established a new, overarching Ministry of Climate Resilience, the Environment, Forestry, Fisheries, Disaster Management and Information. Its  mandate  is to work speedily to ensure that engrained in every aspect of our country\u2019s development is the question of addressing climate change and climate resilience.\n \nGrenada is also currently shifting some of its macroeconomic focus so as  to  ensure that attention  is paid to the development of our green and blue economies, thereby tying economic development and environmental sustainability together. The road to climate-smart sustainability is long and arduous, but it is not insurmountable, and we must ensure that we are strategic on that journey. In building climate-smart and sustainable societies, we cannot overlook the inherent need to improve the health of our citizens and the conditions needed to foster good health.\nUnfortunately, like many Caribbean Community States and other developing nations, Grenada struggles with the scourge of non-communicable diseases. In order to avoid repeating some of the alarming health statistics that confront and challenge us developmentally, I wish only to emphasize that our Government calls for global leadership and looks forward to international solutions that can preserve the health of our people, promote longevity and sustain our future. Indeed, the successful completion of this week\u2019s high-level meetings on non-communicable diseases and tuberculosis is encouraging, particularly in the commitments set forth in the political declarations laudably adopted by consensus. Now is the time to scale up our efforts to ensure that we honour those commitments.\nAs we attempt to create sustainable societies, we are confronted with certain global financial policies and actions that pose significant threats to our region\u2019s sustainable development. Measures such as the withdrawal of correspondent banking services, along with de-risking, blacklisting and graduation to middle-income status, negatively affect Caribbean economies. The unilateral and premature graduation of many small island developing States to middle-income status, without consideration of our region\u2019s specific vulnerabilities, has resulted in significant budgetary shortfalls that adversely affect our economic and social development. Our region has inherent structural economic challenges that already restrict the pace of our development. We ask that those impediments to growth be taken into account when our cases come up for consideration.\nThe Caribbean Development Bank has pioneered the use of vulnerability indices when setting the terms for its financing. We also urge international partners to work towards an acceptable vulnerability  index that holistically assesses our countries\u2019 development risks. On top of that, the withdrawal of correspondent\nbanking services from Caribbean  Community member States can be seen as an economic assault  that will destabilize the financial sector of our already vulnerable economies. Remittances contribute in real and significant terms to the  gross domestic product  of small States. In fact, the World Bank has said that any sudden halt to remittances in economies that rely on those flows could pose a significant threat to their socioeconomic stability.\nIn addition to the threat of lost correspondent banking relationships, we must also contend with the unilateral and often unfounded blacklisting of our institutions as money-launderers and our countries as tax havens. It pains us as policymakers when we expend our limited resources to comply with international rules, only to face arbitrary punishments when we are quite evidently doing our best. There are no easy answers to those challenges, but I urge our partners to desist from draconian approaches to those matters when dealing with vulnerable developing nations.\nGrenada continues to work with our international partners to advance international peace and security. Grenada\u2019s position on the development of nuclear weapons is clear. It is inherently destructive and therefore serves no good purpose for humankind. Deterrence makes sense only where there is the possibility of deployment. The mere existence of those weapons anywhere is unacceptable. Grenada therefore urges its friends to desist from the development and testing of such weapons. Imagine what we could achieve instead if we put our brilliant scientists to work on climate change and building climate-smart resilient and sustainable societies.\nAs we strive to maintain the Caribbean region as a zone of peace, some of us continue to be affected by the traffic in small arms from countries that manufacture and sell  them freely.  In some of our islands, states  of emergency have been declared at various times to control criminal activity resulting from the increasing availability and use of small arms. Small arms and gun violence undermine the rule of law and are often major factors behind the displacement of civilians and the violation of human rights. We cannot build sustainable societies if our public security is incessantly threatened by that scourge.\nThe main purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security and prevent violence and war. The Charter of the United Nations\n \nactually makes only five references to war, while there are 47 references to peace. That is extremely instructive and it is therefore imperative to ensure that the global leadership takes decisive action. Indeed, as we strive to create sustainable societies, the people of Cuba continue to suffer under the decades-old unjust embargo imposed on them by the United States of America. Grenada continues to call for the immediate lifting of the unfair economic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba, and strongly supports resolution 70/5, which calls for an end to the dreadful embargo.\nSome of our neighbours in Latin America are currently experiencing political and economic challenges that threaten the peaceful existence, sustainable development and by extension the stability of the region. Grenada calls for dialogue and asks that good sense and wisdom prevail in all attempts aimed at resolving those conflicts. We also call for respect for the political integrity and sovereignty of those States. The Government of Grenada continues to offer its hand in good faith to facilitate dialogue aimed at settling those disputes.\nIn conclusion, I implore Members to work relentlessly in our pursuit of the purposes of the Organization. Our quest must be for the pursuit of economic opportunities as we strive to achieve peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies for all. Those ideals will be beyond our reach if we do not promote, encourage and insist on resolute global leadership in solving our development challenges, which transcend boundaries.\n"

        "file_text": "I  have the honour to deliver the following statement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Patrice Talon, President of the Republic of Benin, who had to leave New York because of other commitments.\n\u201cOn behalf of the  delegation  of  Benin  and on my own behalf, I would like to reiterate my warmest congratulations to the President on her well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We assure her of Benin\u2019s full support.\n\u201cI would also like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, her predecessor, on the quality of the work accomplished during his mandate. I should also like to greet and express my support to Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General, and to once again wish him every success.\n\u201cI would also like  to  take  this  opportunity to commend  the   holding   here   on   Monday,  24 September, of the high-level plenary meeting devoted to the theme of world peace in honour of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela (see A/73/PV.5). Indeed, Nelson Mandela embodies the core values on which the United Nations is built. The fight against all forms of discrimination and the defence of the fundamental rights of all, the sanctity of diversity recognized as a rich resource, tolerance, forgiveness  and reconciliation,  and the fight for the recognition of the dignity of all were all key aspects of his commitment to social justice, freedom and peace in South Africa. Africa will always have a debt of immense gratitude to that great humanist, whose name will forever be engraved in the hearts and minds of Africans of all generations. It has indeed given shape to the dream of an Africa that stands on its feet, fully itself, bringing its discourse and experience to the development and humanization of our planet.\n\u201cBesides Nelson Mandela, I would also like  to pay tribute to another great African, the late Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, whose charisma and leadership enabled our Organization to make great strides. His tireless commitment to world peace renders him equally worthy of our gratitude.\n\u201cThe year 2018 has been particularly trying for several countries. In that respect, I would like to reiterate my condolences and to express my sympathy to the Governments and the peoples of the Americas, France, Indonesia,  Madagascar, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Germany and Australia, as well as to all the island countries that fell victim to natural disasters this year.\n\u201cFaced with an increasingly turbulent world, beset by crises and difficulties of all kinds, countries have a duty to act in a concerted manner and with strong determination. That is why I welcome the theme of this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and\n \nshared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\u201d From my country\u2019s point of view, that theme impels nations to confront their responsibilities and urges them to work together in a multilateral framework to find appropriate and sustainable solutions to contemporary challenges.\n\u201cBenin continues to believe that international relations should be based primarily on increasingly  close  cooperation  among   States, as well as on the harmonious functioning of international organizations. One major  function of such organizations is to ensure the protection  of common interests and collective security. To question multilateralism would therefore be a  fatal error in a world that will henceforth forever be interconnected.\n\u201cBenin also welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations on a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration here at the United Nations in July, and we look forward to the definitive adoption of the compact in December in Marrakech, Morocco. It should be underscored that that process demonstrates, once again, the power of multilateralism and our ability to compromise on difficult issues that go beyond the narrow confines of our respective national sovereignties.\n\u201cThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its implementation represent an important step in promoting the development of States and the livelihoods of peoples. Accelerating its implementation is a major imperative for the Government of Benin, which is working to find innovative mechanisms to enable it to have access to resources that will ensure financing for the implementation. Those resources, which exist in sufficient quantities on the market but remain difficult to access, will supplement funding and assistance from development partners.\n\u201cI would like, however, to emphasize that, from my Government\u2019s point of view, improving governance is a prerequisite for achieving the objectives of our Revealing Benin programme and the Sustainable Development Goals. This is why the fight against impunity and corruption is at the heart of my Government\u2019s actions and the work undertaken by all our national institutions. In the course of this year, our legislative arsenal has been strengthened, and a special court has been created\nand made operational to crack down on economic crime and terrorism.\n\u201cThose measures are necessary in order to ensure that mobilized financial resources serve their intended purposes. They also aim to make national stakeholders more honest and to ensure the quality of public spending. My Government\u2019s ambition is to ensure that all citizens have access to drinking water, primary health care and education, and can be ensured a decent life. Realizing that legitimate ambition justifies the establishment of  a vast rural water supply project and an insurance initiative for reinforcing human capital, which seek to provide social security to all, particularly to those who are most disadvantaged.\n\u201cThe Government of Benin is also implementing measures to ensure better health care for the entire population. They include guaranteeing the quality of drugs sold for therapeutic purposes, which is a major public-health requirement. Benin has begun a relentless fight against counterfeit and poor-quality medicines circulating in its territory. In order to overcome that scourge of clearly transnational dimensions, it is important that the international community mobilize itself within the framework of a global partnership against impunity and indifference in order to ensure equality of access to high-quality medicines for rich and poor alike.\n\u201cFurthermore, Benin is committed to a tourism development policy, which can produce rapid growth with a high social impact. Given its rich culture and historic legacy, Benin has begun developing flagship projects in the field of tourism, combining our heritage, culture, modernity and openness to the world. In order to create the conditions enabling tourism to become one of the drivers of our economic growth and socioeconomic development, Benin is in the process of building three museums equipped with the most modern means of conservation and exhibition to reveal, in a new spirit, its contribution and role in the evolution of humankind to the world.\n\u201cWith the restitution of our cultural property, Benin wishes to reclaim the epic of its kings and elite female warrior corps or Amazons and the remains of the largest West African port in the history of slavery \u2014 as well as the wealth of arts and culture of its voodoo heritage \u2014 and tell it to\n \nthe world. Many of the works that bear witness to our rich past are currently being held abroad in public and private collections. In that context, their restitution takes on a restorative and economic dimension. That is why, since 2016, Benin has been strongly committed to achieving the restitution of cultural property to their countries of origin. In that long-term, legitimate struggle, strong action in terms of international cooperation is required. Benin therefore welcomes the positive reaction on the part of the authorities of the French Republic to its restitution demands.\n\u201cHowever, the question goes far beyond Franco-Beninese relations. A number of other countries face the same problems.  Nevertheless, it is possible to note that those issues \u2014 beyond their historical, sociological or philosophical dimensions \u2014 are not well covered in international law. Benin would like to invite the United Nations to consider, in a positive and cooperative manner, the possibility of adopting a binding international instrument on that issue.\n\u201cThe  preservation  of  international  peace and security represents a major and constant strategic axis of Benin\u2019s foreign policy. My country considers peacekeeping operations to be one of the most important tools that the United Nations has at its disposal to achieve peace and security. That is why, despite our limited capacity and means, my  country  has  been  associated with international initiatives to prevent  crises and maintain peace for decades. My delegation therefore welcomes the recent adoption by the General Assembly of the proposed restructuring of the United Nations peace and security pillar. We also strongly support the actions initiated by the Secretary-General to increase the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations through the definition of more precise mandates by the Security Council and the establishment of stronger partnerships with regional and subregional organizations.\n\u201cBenin welcomes and strongly supports the United Nations zero-tolerance policy to combat sexual exploitation and abuse in the context of peacekeeping operations. As a troop-contributing country, Benin is  committed  to  fully  playing our role in that regard. My delegation remains concerned, however, about the steady decline in resources allocated to peacekeeping. The principle\nof doing more with less is not appropriate there, given the increasing complexity of the threats faced by peacekeepers today on the ground.\n\u201cIn addition, my delegation regrets the  lack  of progress on the issue of Security Council reform. We reaffirm our support for the Ezulwini Consensus, which calls for the allocation of two permanent Security Council seats to Africa, including the right to veto. We are convinced that the equitable representation of Member States in the Security Council would lead to the more inclusive and effective management of major contemporary political issues.\n\u201cBenin, having just adopted a law on radiation protection, wishes to commend the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to establish a universal plan for the use of nuclear energy for strictly civilian purposes and reiterates its support for measures aimed at establishing a nuclear- weapon-free zone in the Middle East.\n\u201cI cannot conclude my statement without reaffirming Benin\u2019s support for the United Nations efforts to create a viable Palestinian State with the attributes of full international sovereignty, living side-by-side and in perfect harmony with the State of Israel.\n\u201cLong live the United Nations in the service  of peace, security, the promotion of human rights, democracy and sustainable development!\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by congratulating the President on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. Her assumption of that important office contributes to our progress in breaking down the barriers of inequality, considering that she is one of only four women to have held that position in 73 years.\nThe President is the first woman from the Latin America and Caribbean region to have  been  elected to that post, and we are especially proud of her achievement. Saint Lucia is a staunch advocate for gender equality, as evidenced by the large percentage of Saint Lucian women who hold senior positions in and out of Government, including the four female ministers in my Cabinet. The President can rest assured that she has my delegation\u2019s full support at the upcoming session.\nI  stand before the Assembly today as a  leader of  a small island developing State (SIDS) that is also a middle-income country. Saint Lucia\u2019s engagement in the international system is framed by acronyms that represent designations and categorizations that have been globally accepted. For example, it has become\naccepted that SIDS are more vulnerable to natural hazards than other countries. The fact that the resulting damage from natural disasters has a greater overall impact on our economies by virtue of our small size has also become widely accepted. The fact that SIDS that are also middle-income countries face additional challenges because of the assumptions regarding the capabilities of countries carrying that designation has also been acknowledged.\nWe all know those truths. They are, in fact, self- evident. This Hall has echoed with the words of SIDS and middle-income country leaders, who make plain and clear, year after year, the challenges  that  we  face. Yet global policies, programmes and strategies remain unfairly unaccommodating to those very real and true challenges. The world acknowledges our acronyms, but little or nothing else changes. Saint Lucia remains economically vulnerable to de-risking and the  loss  of  correspondent  banking  relations. We remain excluded from access to concessionary financing. Our reputations are unfairly tarnished by tax-related labels. We continue to struggle under the weight of international frameworks that do not provide an enabling environment for my country to chart an effective sustainable development path or even to be able to take control of our own destiny.\nDespite the fact that the odds remain stacked against us, Saint Lucia must survive and persist. I have an obligation to the people of my country, and so I must find new and innovative ways, regardless of the difficulties, to keep our economy growing and to ensure and enhance environmental and social protections. I do not have the luxury of waiting for the international system to adjust to the special needs of countries like my own, while natural disasters continue to threaten and erode the gains that we have made. In preparation for the coming hurricane season, Saint Lucia has had to spend three times the amount of money that we did last season. In order to meet those costs, we have had to impose new taxes to facilitate our preparedness.\nFor example,  we  have  introduced  a  water  tax  to assist with the de-silting of our dam, a gas tax to assist with road rehabilitation and slope stabilization, and an airport tax to assist with the development of a new terminal, as well as highway and flood mitigation measures around the airport. Saint Lucia is moving forward with an aggressive agenda to reform our institutions and build a more  resilient  country.  We are making difficult decisions and are committed to\n \nincreasing the productivity of our Government through the use of e-Government tools. I want to acknowledge and thank Estonia for its assistance in that area.\nWe are building resilience with the support of the United Arab Emirates, which has given us assistance in the form of engineers, and with loans from Taiwan to enable us to rebuild our roads and our airport. I want to thank my citizens, in particular, for their continued support and understanding. We will play our part in the adaptation of our economy, and we will adapt to the new normal.\nThe President of the World Bank has acknowledged that \u201cgood health is the foundation of a country\u2019s human capital, and no country can afford low-quality or unsafe health care\u201d. The challenge of providing adequate and affordable health care is another area of focus for Saint Lucia. We understand that preventive and affordable health care is critical to the  social  development  of any nation, and more so for a small State  with  a  small population. We are plagued with cases where individuals delay in seeking early medical assistance owing to the high cost, only to be saddled with a serious diagnosis later, thereby increasing the cost burden to the State and the individual.\nWe have therefore taken steps to address the issue from multiple angles. We are working with partners such as the European Union and the World Bank with the goal of implementing the necessary policies and legislation to give life to a national health-insurance scheme. We are also looking into preventive approaches, such as the imposition of appropriate labelling and a sugar tax, as we grapple with the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases. We are also expanding our after-school programmes, which focus on building healthy lifestyles through physical activity and diet. We are establishing sports academies complete with nutritionists who will be community-based so that their expertise can be shared.\nSaint Lucia has worked hard to grow and develop within the context of an international system that acknowledges our existence and needs only theoretically, while any practical and tangible manifestation of those acknowledgements is rarely seen or felt.\nWe have seen the disastrous impact of natural disasters brought on by the changes in our climate. As I speak, my country is suffering from the ravages of Tropical Storm Kirk, which was on a projected course north of my island but changed direction overnight and\nmoved directly over Saint Lucia. This morning, Saint Lucia also suffered an earthquake. Early reports indicate damage to our utilities that remain above ground and extensive damage to the agricultural sector. Once again, my heart goes out to our hard-working men and women and the communities that depend on agriculture. But they may rest assured that regardless of the difficulties, we will provide the necessary support to help our people recover as quickly as possible. My thoughts and prayers are also with the Government and the people of Barbados, who have also been affected, as well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which now lies in the path of the storm, and Martinique, which suffered an earthquake this morning.\nOur resilience as a people and our ability to pick ourselves up should not be used to punish us. I applaud Japan, India and the numerous states within the United States of America that have the capacity to respond effectively to natural disasters. I envy the fact that they have the fiscal and policy space they need to enable them to effectively recover and rebuild, while we, as SIDS, are continually denied that ability.\nWe are aware that Dominica, the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, among others, are still recovering from the storms one year later. Yet little has changed. The Caribbean Community-United Nations High-Level Pledging Conference to support reconstruction efforts in the region following Hurricanes Irma and Maria received pledges of more than $1.3 billion, but there remains a significant gap between the pledges made and the actual amounts that have been disbursed. While those pledges were well intended, we have been let down once again.\nMy delegation welcomes the initiative to convene a high-level meeting on the challenges of middle-income countries during this seventy-third session of the General Assembly. Saint Lucia has continued to place our concerns about debt sustainability on the global agenda. We have joined the call for the creation of a highly indebted middle-income-country initiative based not only on the urgent need for debt relief, but also on the need to acknowledge and highlight the negative implications of the challenges that middle-income countries  face in  accessing   concessionary financing \u2014 so vital to building resilience in our countries. We fear a business-as-usual approach to such a meeting, but remain hopeful that it will provide substantive outcomes with actionable solutions.\n \nMultilateralism is under threat. We have heard the cries from leaders this week. The winds of nationalism that threaten to blow us away from our collective endeavours here at the United Nations are gathering strength. But Saint Lucia believes that it is  only within a strong, functional multilateral system that the guarantees of world peace and security can be provided. To paraphrase what Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has said, in a world in which all problems are global, there is no way countries can handle issues by themselves. We need global responses.\nThe ongoing reform of the United Nations system is critical. The increasingly  chaotic  world  requires an organization that is responsive and effective and that reflects the political and economic reality of a changing world and of all its Member States. We can no longer operate within a framework of ideologies, policies, institutions and patterns of behaviour that were established at a time long past to deal with circumstances long gone.\nWe must be willing to challenge discrimination and exclusion if we hope to create an equal and just world for all. Every country has a role to play in this global environment. We know that. Saint Lucia joins the other voices calling for an end to the more than half-a-century-old embargo imposed on our neighbour Cuba, and to all restrictions on the rights of the Cuban people, particularly regarding liberty, security and advancement. Similarly, we call for an end to the restrictions on the legitimate  aspirations  of  Taiwan to participate as an observer in key international institutions, such as the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We demand that as much for us as for them.\nIn our hemisphere, where confrontations and disagreements exist, I reaffirm Saint Lucia\u2019s position that all conflicts must be resolved through diplomatic channels. As we work to reform this institution, we must ensure that no one is left behind. We must find the political will and courage to ensure that the United Nations, as currently evolved, not only acknowledges the challenges of its membership but provides adequate solutions for all.\nNotwithstanding the myriad challenges that frame our engagement in the international system, Saint Lucia remains committed to the objectives of\nmultilateralism. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was a triumph of multilateral cooperation, but it is the successful implementation of the Agenda, the fulfilment of the promise of its purpose, that will define the true measure of our collective will to transform and develop as a global community.\nIt is within that context that Saint Lucia has committed to presenting its voluntary national review of our progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda at the 2019 high-level political forum on sustainable development. I am also pleased to report that Saint Lucia will deposit the required instrument to ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol before the start of the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. This week, Saint Lucia also reaffirmed its commitment to international law by signing the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nIn order to build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, SIDS, particularly those  that  are middle-income countries, must look to a different course of action in order to arrive at a more immediate solution to our development challenges, while we continue to call for changes in the international system. Saint Lucia has recorded two successive years of consistent economic growth. We have increased our tax revenue and are on course to attract record foreign direct investment. We are still competing, having to find new ways to ensure our growth and development, but imagine how much better we could do in building economic and social resilience to further enhance our ability to meet our sustainable development goals and improve the quality of life of our citizens if a fair and just international enabling environment were made available to us.\nLet us not forget that we come together here as nations united to build institutions, norms and rules that advance the shared interests of all, not only those of a select few. The enormous challenges of our moment in history require a renewed social contract, based on shared responsibility, and the space to achieve that global compact is right here at the United Nations. Let us draw on the inspiration of Nelson Mandela and his incredible ability to forgive and find solutions for the greater human good.\n \nThere is a Buddhist proverb that says, \u201cTo know and not to do is not yet to know\u201d. If the international community claims to know and accept the special circumstances and vulnerabilities of the SIDS, and does nothing to remedy the systems and frameworks that exacerbate our vulnerability, can the international community say that it really knows? Have we truly accepted the evidence? While the answers to those questions may not be readily available, countries like my own have to chart a development  path  through this changing and volatile world. It is my hope that as multilateralism evolves, and with it this institution, we will arrive at knowing and at doing what must be done.\n"

        "file_text": "The General Assembly is a representation of humankind in its fullness. I therefore congratulate the President of the General Assembly. Her ascendance to this seat reminds us that there are no minorities in the Organization, and we are proud to see the Assembly led by a  woman of  her repute  and intellectual prowess. Once again, I convey to her my congratulations.\nTen days ago, Africa lost a Malawian  who  was our first Ambassador to the General Assembly. David Rubadiri represented the conscience of the African continent and a pan-African poet who was adopted\n \nby East Africa as its son. One month ago, the world lost an African who was the  first Secretary-General of the United Nations from black Africa. Kofi Annan was an African and an inspiring spirit of the world. He was a voice of peace, a voice for the voiceless and the conscience and moral arbiter of the world. He decisively carried forward the flag of peace amid turmoil when some of us were busy declaring war on peace.\nToday I stand to urge the Assembly to raise high that flag of peace for which my brother Kofi Annan stood. I urge the Assembly to rise and march forward in that spirit of defending peace. Peace is a universal desire. We all desire peace. It must be diligently sought by us all. Peace is precious. Peace is delicate. It must be jealously guarded by  us all. We  cannot sit  here as a proud Assembly while out there human communities are being driven from their homes, forced to abandon their countries and condemned to unknown destinies of homeless survival. Every human needs a home. We cannot be proud as members of humankind when out there innocent children, voiceless men and vulnerable women are suffering and being killed. Every life is precious. History will measure our global leadership and the legacy of the Organization on the scales of how we defend the defenceless, feed the hungry and empower the weak. History will judge our generation on how we defend human life and protect this endangered planet. It is therefore our shared responsibility to seek peace in all its forms, defend peace and reach out to reason with those who declare war on peace.\nThe relevance of the Organization rests on our ability to satisfy the needs of people across the\nworld. That includes Africa, as I will argue in my conclusion. Let us never doubt that the pursuit of shared responsibility implies collective inclusion. Every nation is important, and we all have something to offer. That is why I began my address by reminding the Assembly that there are no minorities here. There are no small nations. There are only nations in the United Nations. Of course, let us admit that there will always be economic inequality among nations and, yes, we  all have something to offer to humankind. But those with more resources and power must step up and offer more. Let us remember that power is not status; power is responsibility. Leadership is not prestige; leadership is responsibility. We must define global leadership in terms of global responsibility.\nWe are prepared to fulfil our responsibility and obligations in the global community. Malawi remains committed to the ideals of the United Nations. Malawi subscribes to the values of democratic governance, peace and security. We remain committed to participating in efforts to maintain international peace and security. Malawi remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights. We remain committed to participating in international cooperation to resolve the challenges that face human societies.\nMalawi acknowledges the sacrifices being made by the Blue Helmets. The composition of the Blue Helmets demonstrates the commitment of the United Nations to the principle of including nations of all regions. We are proud to be an active contributor to peacekeeping operations across the world. For us, defending peace is a precious sacrifice. Malawi has served in peacekeeping missions in Darfur, Lesotho and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. As I speak, we are part of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nIn our pursuit to promote peace, justice and effective institutions, I would like to announce that in 2019 a high- level political forum on Sustainable Development Goal 16 will convene in Malawi. I welcome the opportunity and honour of hosting the forum. I believe that the event will be a significant catalyst to our resolve to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 16.\nMalawi supports the determination of the United Nations to galvanize international cooperation in promoting socioeconomic development. We are committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We support the priorities of the United\n \nNations in eradicating poverty and hunger in all its forms and dimensions. The priorities of the United Nations are also Malawi\u2019s priorities, and we will not relent until we have accomplished the full hierarchy of our priorities.\nWe are proud of our efforts and achievements in maternal health, girls\u2019 education, youth empowerment and gender equality. However, the plight of refugees and migrants is a concern for the people of Malawi.  As Malawians,  we  believe  that  refugees  are  part  of our human family. We believe in our collective responsibility to ensure refugees\u2019 protection, safety and access to refuge. As a result, Malawi has been hosting refugees for decades.\nI would also like to report that this year Malawi received a high-level delegation from the  Office of  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We are actively part of the initiative to develop a comprehensive refugee response framework, which was agreed by States Members. We have developed the concept for the framework that is to be rolled out in Malawi within our national development strategy and our cooperation agreement with the United Nations.\nOn another matter, Malawi is  both a victim and  a fighter of climate change. The consequences of climate change are real, devastating and often tragic on a large scale. For that reason, I would like to urge all Governments, business leaders, investors and civil society to fight to bend the curve of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nWe must move to accelerate the green transition, create more jobs and provide sustainable  transport and clean energy systems. Malawi is  doing  its  part by implementing various disaster risk-reduction and resilience-building initiatives, but we cannot do it alone. We need adequate, predictable and sustainable resources of climate financing, such as the Green Climate Fund, in order to support our actions.\nI would also like to report that my Government is endeavouring to eliminate hunger and malnutrition by 2030. Given the hostile consequences of climate change, food insecurity and malnutrition are  serious  threats in a country that still relies on rain-fed subsistence agriculture.\nWe believe that inclusive and resilient economic growth is key to overcoming hunger and reducing\npoverty. In that regard, over the past four years we have relentlessly pursued macroeconomic measures that are now improving Malawi\u2019s economy. We have stabilized the economy within four years despite the natural disasters of floods, drought and hunger that hit Malawi for two consecutive years. Within four troubled years, we have reduced inflation from 24 per cent to a single digit percentage. We have reduced interest rates from 25 to 16 per cent. We have taken our import cover from the lowest to the highest point in our economic history. Our import cover has risen from less than two months to six months. We have made the local currency stable and predictable.\nAbove all, when I began my leadership in Malawi four years ago, we were seeing a 2.4 per cent growth rate in gross domestic product. We now expect growth of 4 per cent in our  2018-2019  financial  year,  and we expect that to rise to 6 per cent in 2019. We are improving those macroeconomic indicators because a bad economy is an injustice to our country\u2019s citizens.\nAt the same time, we continue to focus on the justice of specific sectors of our society. We are fighting against violence against women and girls. I believe that no human society can meaningfully develop while marginalizing its women. Development must always be inclusive. With the support of the United Nations and other development partners, particularly the European Union, in 2019 Malawi will implement the Spotlight Initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls.\nI reiterate that no society  can  progress  without its young people. Malawi  is  therefore  implementing a number of youth programmes, including a skills development programme that involves establishing community technical colleges. We are empowering young people with skills so that they can create jobs and businesses for themselves and others. We believe that no society can develop without a skilled labour force. Our urgent need is to train the trainers for that youth programme.\nI would also add that Malawi believes that citizens of every nation must have legal  identities.  Malawi  has fulfilled that principle. Today, more than 95 per cent of my people aged 16 and older have national identity cards, and we are in the process of integrating the national identity cards to be used in education, finance, agriculture, security, social welfare and other public institutions.\n \nMalawi will always be a team player in the international community. We support the United Nations initiatives in fighting global systemic threats and challenges, including terrorism and climate change. We support the United Nations development system. In that regard, Malawi welcomes the adoption of resolution 72/279, on the repositioning of the United Nations development system, as well as resolution 72/305, on the review of the implementation of resolution 68/1, on the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council.\nWe strongly support the Common African Position calling for two permanent seats with veto power and five non-permanent seats for Africa on the Security Council. Why should some nations be afraid of losing power by offering decision-making  space  to  Africa if they do not lose power when they accommodate other continents? Is Africa that much of a threat? That segregation of Africans must come to an end. Why should we allow the Organization to be accused of the hypocrisy that while we preach democracy everywhere, we are not democratic enough to accommodate almost one third of the membership of the Assembly?\nI would like to conclude by commending the ironic wisdom in the theme that was chosen for this year. Let us prove that we can live up to its demands. We cannot talk about shared responsibility while we marginalize Africans and deny them full participation in our decisions. We cannot talk about the global leadership of the United Nations when African leadership is not at the decision-making tables. In any political system, we cannot claim relevance for the people that we deny.\nThe time has come to make the United Nations relevant to all people. The time has come to show a global leadership that is inclusive of all nations. The time has come to pledge shared responsibilities together with Africa and the rest of the world. The time has come for this Assembly to listen to the voice of Africa. Let us listen.\n"

        "file_text": "I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Madam, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nWe have assembled here today as the world is suffering from the recklessness of and disregard by some States for international values and institutions. We are here because the preservation of interests and security in the world in the least costly manner  is  possible only through the cooperation of and coordination among countries. However, it is unfortunate that we are seeing rulers in the world who  think  that  they can better secure their own interests, and who,  at  least in the short term, ride public sentiment and gain popular support by fomenting extremist nationalism, racism and xenophobic tendencies that resemble a Nazi disposition, while trampling global norms and undermining international institutions, even through preposterous and anomalous acts such as convening a high-level meeting of the Security Council.\nThe illusion that one can aspire to securing greater peace and security at the cost of denying others that same peace and security should be cast aside once and for all. We should not allow any breathing space for or the development of a line of thinking that holds others to ransom through the artificial creation of insecurity. In that regard, confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength; rather, it is the symptom of intellectual weakness and betrays an inability to understand a complex and interconnected world.\nUnder such circumstances, the negligence or inefficacy of international institutions can endanger world peace. Those seeking dominance and hegemony are enemies of peace and are the perpetrators of war. The Government of the United States of America \u2014 at least the current Administration \u2014 seems determined to render all international institutions ineffectual. That Government, having withdrawn from a multilateral agreement adopted by the Security Council, in contravention of the rules and norms of international law, has invited the Islamic Republic of Iran to bilateral talks. The Administration that is inviting Iran to engage in talks is not ready to consult its own experts or willing to recognize the requirements of a modern State, including the paramount principle of the continuity of State responsibility and, therefore, is openly violating the State obligations undertaken by its predecessor.\nOn what basis  and  criteria  can  we  enter  into  an agreement with an Administration that is guilty\n \nof such misconduct? Any talks should take place within the framework and in continuation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), and not within a framework of breaching such agreements and reverting to the past. It is ironic that the United States Government is not even concealing its plan to overthrow the same Government that it is inviting to talks.\nThe approach of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the field of foreign policy has been based on multilateralism and compliance with the recognized principles of international law. Our respect for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the long and difficult negotiations with the five plus one group, which led to the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is a clear illustration of that approach.\nWe are pleased that the international community did not acquiesce to the United States Government\u2019s unilateral and illegal withdrawal from the JCPOA and adopted a categorical position vis-\u00e0-vis that decision. The JCPOA was the outcome of more than a decade of diplomatic efforts and a period of intensive negotiations to resolve an artificial crisis. It was unanimously approved through the adoption of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) and codified into an international obligation. The resolution calls on all countries and international and regional organizations to support the implementation of the JCPOA and refrain from any actions that would undermine the implementation of commitments under the JCPOA.\nAccording to 12 consecutive reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has thus far complied with all of its commitments. However, from the very beginning, the United States did not honour its obligations. The current Administration, resorting to flimsy excuses and in open violation of its commitments, finally withdrew from the accord. The United Nations should not allow its decisions to fall victim to the domestic elections and propaganda games of some of its Members and should not allow any Member State to dodge the execution of its international commitments.\nMoreover, the United States  also  pressures  other countries to violate the nuclear accord. More dangerously, the United States is threatening all countries and international organizations with punishment if they comply with Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). It is the first time in the history of the United Nations that such a general invitation\nto violate the law has been coupled with threatening law-abiders with punishment. That is not unique to the JCPOA; it is a pattern that even applies to the United States approach to the International Criminal Court.\nWe appreciate the efforts of the international community, the European Union, Russia and China in supporting the implementation of the JCPOA and for considering the full realization of the commitments stipulated in it a precondition for the survival of that significant accomplishment of diplomacy.\nUnlawful unilateral sanctions constitute  a  form of economic terrorism and a breach of the right to development. The economic war that the United States has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the Iranian people, but will also have harmful repercussions for the people of other countries. Moreover, that war has caused a disruption to the state of global trade.\nThe Iranian  people have demonstrated their unwavering resilience over the past 40 years, despite the difficulties and constraints caused by sanctions, and have also shown that they can overcome such difficult periods. The multi-millennial history of our country demonstrates that Iran and Iranians have never broken in the face of a storm \u2014 not even been bowed.\nI state here, in clear, unambiguous terms, that the United States policy vis-\u00e0-vis  the  Islamic  Republic of Iran has been wrong from the beginning, and its approach of resisting the wishes of the Iranian people, as manifested in numerous elections, is doomed to fail. Iran, with its historical and civilizational longevity, rich cultural heritage and foremost geopolitical position is an undeniable reality. Policies of engagement and cooperation with Iran have produced positive outcomes for other nations, as best reflected in Iran\u2019s cooperation with friendly countries in the fight against terrorism.\nThe United States understanding of international relations is authoritarian. In its estimation, might makes right. Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in its bullying and imposition. No State or nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force and, if so, what follows is an accumulation of the grapes of wrath in those nations, which is later reaped by the oppressors.\nWe concur that ultimately there is no better alternative to dialogue. However, dialogue is two- way; it should be based on equality, justice and human\n \nintegrity and honour and conducted in accordance with the rules and norms of international law. Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) is not merely a  piece of paper. We invite the United States to return to that resolution and come back to the negotiating table it left. If the United States dislikes the JCPOA because  it is the legacy of its domestic political rivals, then we invite it to return to that Security Council resolution. We invite that country to remain in international institutions and implore it not to engage in imposing sanctions. Sanctions and extremism are two sides of the same coin. Extremism involves negating the thinking of others, and sanctions negate the life and prosperity of people.\nFor dialogue to take place, there is no need for a photo opportunity. The two sides can listen to each other right here in the Assembly. I am starting the dialogue right here and state, in unequivocal terms, that the question of international security is not a toy for American domestic politics. The United Nations is not a part of the United States Administration. Dialogue can resume in the Assembly from the same point at which it stopped and by the same person who left the dialogue table and walked away from the accord. Beginning that dialogue starts with the ending of threats and unjust sanctions that negate the principles of ethics and international law.\nOur proposal is clear: commitment for commitment, violation for violation, threat for threat and step for step, instead of talk for talk. What Iran is saying is  clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats and no bullying, just acting in accordance with the law and the fulfilment of obligations. We support peace and democracy in the entire Middle East. We consider nuclear knowledge an imperative and nuclear weapons prohibited.\nAs victims of terrorism in  the  past  and  today, we have always been and will always remain at the forefront of genuine confrontation of terrorism. Today we mourn the martyrdom of the dozens of innocent people who were murdered on Saturday in cold blood by terrorists who shamelessly accepted responsibility from a number of Western capitals for their heinous crime in interviews with Western-based broadcasting outfits that are financed by petrodollars.\nWe in Iran have unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and will continue to do so. We welcome the strong statement from the Security Council  on this issue. But why can the leaders of those terrorist\noperations, including the organization that has publicly claimed responsibility for Saturday\u2019s crime, live and operate freely in Western countries, and even openly solicit funds? Are those activities not in violation of international counter-terrorism norms?  Why  have  the official State financiers of anti-Iranian terrorist organizations, with their record of financing Al-Qaida, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and the Al-Nusra Front, not only been spared any punishment but are also supported and armed? If the United States wants the world\u2019s public to take its claim of fighting terrorism seriously, it is imperative that it start a joint global campaign to fight that scourge, irrespective of the victims or culprits.\nIn that regard, from the very beginning of the crisis in Syria we have warned against any foreign intervention in the internal affairs  of  that  country and the use of unlawful means, including supporting extremist and terrorist groups, in order to exert pressure on the Government of Syria. We have consistently emphasized that the crisis can be resolved only through intra-Syrian dialogue. To that end, the presence of our military advisers in Syria has been at the request of the Syrian Government, is consistent with international law  and has aimed to assist the Syrian Government   in combating extremist terrorism. Iran, Russia and Turkey, in cooperation with the Government of Syria and other Syrian parties, have succeeded through the Astana process, the third summit meeting of which took place in Tehran earlier this month, in playing a positive role and reducing tension in Syria. Their last joint effort prevented escalation and bloodshed in the Idlib region.\nWe have witnessed a tragic humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen over the past three years, which has caused the destruction of infrastructure, the death and injury of hundreds of thousands of people, the displacement of millions of innocent civilians, widespread famine and chronic disease. Those inhumane acts represent clear examples of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The crisis in Yemen can be resolved only through intra-Yemeni talks and without foreign interference. To that end, we are ready to assist in any possible way.\nThe most pressing crisis in the Middle East, however, is the question of Palestine. The passage of time cannot, and must not, justify occupation. The innumerable crimes of Israel against the Palestinians would not have been possible without  the  material and military assistance and political and propaganda\n \nsupport of the  United  States.  Israel,  equipped  with a nuclear arsenal and blatantly threatening  others  with nuclear annihilation, presents the most daunting threat to regional and global peace and stability. The abhorrent United States decision to transfer its Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and the recent enactment of the racist Jewish State law are violations of international law and norms, as well as unmistakable manifestations of apartheid.\nThe expansion of relations with neighbours and the creation of a more secure and more developed region are among the main priorities of Iran\u2019s foreign policy. A few weeks ago Iran, along with the other four coastal States of the region, signed the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, which will strengthen good-neighbourliness and bring about prosperity and progress for all of the coastal States.\nWe also desire the same relations with our southern neighbours in the Persian Gulf. We believe in the formation of a collective mechanism for the Persian Gulf region, with the presence and participation of all regional countries. The security of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz has always been important for us and, just as we upheld their security during the war imposed on us by Iraq, we will confront any disruptive effort regarding that critical waterway in the future.\nWe espouse a peaceful view on political and international issues and have not sought, and do not seek, war with any country. Iran does not need an empire. Iran is an empire in terms of civilization and culture, not through political domination. Iran has served as the link between East and West and will continue to do so, remaining a meticulous guardian for a world free from violence.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is the same State that understood the fascist nature of the Ba\u2019athist regime  in Iraq before anyone else in the world and bravely resisted its aggression against us. We fought against the Ba\u2019ath Party of Iraq before it occupied Kuwait. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the same State that was at the forefront of the struggle against Taliban terrorism and gave up martyrs in that struggle. We fought against Al-Qaida and the Taliban before the attacks on New York and Washington, D.C. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the same State that fought against Da\u2019esh, a fake, distorted representation of Islam. We were engaged in the fight against Da\u2019esh before its operations in Paris, London and Brussels.\nAppreciate those historical realities regarding Iran, stop imposing sanctions and end extremism. The world does not have a better friend than Iran, if peace is what it seeks.\n"

        "file_text": "I  wish  to  congratulate  Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session.\nOn 21 July, the people of Namibia and  our  friends around the world laid to rest our first Foreign Minister, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab. He represented our liberation movement, the South West Africa People\u2019s Organization, at the United Nations for more than 15 years. Under his presidency at the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, we adopted the Millennium Development Goals, the precursor to the Sustainable Development  Goals.  The  family  of  Mr.  Gurirab, the Government and the people of the Republic of Namibia have been deeply touched by the outpouring of condolences and sympathies following his death. We are deeply appreciative of the memorial service held in his honour here at Headquarters.\nTwo months ago, I travelled to Nigeria to bury former Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, Mr. Adebayo Adedeji, who stood by our side during our liberation. Two weeks ago, I travelled to Accra for the burial of Mr. Kofi Annan, the seventh  Secretary-General  of the Organization \u2014 a son of Africa whose flame was extinguished but whose light will shine on throughout the ages. A few days ago, in this very Hall, we gathered to pay tribute to that revered personality and architect of peace. He was a man of great stature who dedicated his entire adult life to the pursuit of global peace and security. May the souls of those distinguished sons of Africa and of the United Nations rest in eternal peace.\nFollowing the end of the Cold War and the old bipolar dispensation, the world has  slowly  drifted ever more worryingly towards unilateral action. That development goes against one of the fundamental tenets of democracy upon which the Organization was built. It is for that reason that we must embrace multilateralism with greater urgency to counter unilateral action. It is also for the same reason that we fully concur with the Secretary-General\u2019s sentiments, as expressed in his statement in paragraph 1 of his report on the work of the Organization (A/73/1), that,\n\u201cAs today\u2019s problems grow ever more global, multilateralism is more important than ever.\u201d\nThe Republic of Namibia was founded on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and justice. The fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in\nour Constitution include virtually all of the rights and freedoms recognized in international human rights instruments. However, those instruments in and of themselves are not sufficient to bring about sustainable development. Namibia recognizes that there are existing and emerging threats and challenges that continue to frustrate individual and collective efforts to achieve greater socioeconomic progress. To that end, Namibia has embraced sustainable development and is fully committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its principles, goals, targets and indicators. As a matter of fact, Namibia has integrated all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targets into its national development plans. As a dry and arid country, often affected by seasonal droughts and floods, we have stepped up our efforts to implement the SDGs in critical areas such as energy, water and terrestrial ecosystems. In that regard, Namibia wishes to benefit from the assistance to be provided by the Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries, established in Istanbul on 4 June, to identify and locate drought and flood areas in a timely manner.\nAlthough Namibia has witnessed sustained economic growth over many of the past 10 years, unemployment remains persistently high. Nevertheless, Namibia has seen one of the most rapid decreases in poverty levels in our region over the past 10 years, from\n28.8 per cent to 17.4 per cent. I am also happy to inform the Assembly that life expectancy in Namibia has risen from 58 to 65 years of age.\nHowever, inequality in Namibia remains a challenge, as reflected in the skewed ownership of land, whereby white Namibians own 70  per cent of  all agricultural land. As part of its efforts to create conditions favourable to fighting poverty and maintain peace and stability, Namibia will hold its second national land conference during the first week of October. In preparation for the conference, the Government has conducted consultations in all of our 14 regions so as to ensure an inclusive process. We believe in consultations. If diplomacy fails, people go to war. That is why we are pursuing an inclusive consultative process, with the full knowledge that inclusivity spells harmony and exclusivity spells conflict. We have made a concerted effort to include as many stakeholders as possible and to ensure that everything will be done within the ambit of our laws. Accordingly, we call on our development partners to support the outcome of the conference so\n \nthat they can continue assisting us in the process of socioeconomic transformation.\nI have stated before that Namibia\u2019s classification as an upper-middle-income nation fails to consider the skewed distribution of income. That  status prevents us from accessing official development assistance and affordable, concessional finance. The situation has the potential to jeopardize efforts in Namibia and other developing countries to fully achieve the 2030 Agenda.\nCommunicable diseases also threaten to jeopardize our reaching the 2030 Agenda Goals. For that reason, Namibia endorses the call to end endemic tuberculosis and reaffirms its commitment to join the world in working to achieve that goal. With a population of approximately 2.5 million people, Namibia ranks as the ninth most tuberculosis-affected country in the world, which is one  of  the  top  three causes leading to hospitalization. The Government of Namibia has demonstrated its commitment to addressing that disease by including related targets in its fifth national development plan, as well as by ensuring that 70 per cent of available funding for tuberculosis comes from domestic resources.\nI should caution that inadequate human and financial resources, high levels of poverty and  the lack of public-health services in rural areas remain a concern. As the Chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), our country reaffirms its commitment to the African Union Declaration on Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and other Related Infectious Diseases, working within the Harmonized Surveillance Framework for HIV and AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in the SADC Region, and will join the international community in the fight against tuberculosis.\nI congratulate the Secretary-General for launching the United Nations Global Youth  Strategy.  Africa  has the fastest-growing youth population. In my capacity as Chairperson of SADC, I wish to inform the Assembly that the region has adopted a  strategy  to achieve industrialization by 2063. In that regard,  the thirty-eighth SADC Summit, held in Windhoek in August, adopted the theme \u201cPromoting infrastructure development and youth empowerment for sustainable development\u201d. We are convinced that  the  youth  of the SADC region, and of the world in general, are the future custodians of our social, political, economic and governance infrastructure. As such, young people need\nto be provided with the requisite skills and training and be economically empowered through entrepreneurship to drive development towards inclusive growth and shared prosperity. The youth of the SADC region, like their counterparts in the rest of the world, yearn for better prospects. They yearn for a future of opportunity and job certainty, wherein the fourth Industrial Revolution will represent  opportunities, not  threats. A future characterized by the rapid advancement of technology, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence and mechanization should present more opportunities, rather than problems, for our youth and for humankind in general. The onus is on us to mitigate the potential problems that might accompany those technologies and to understand how they can be  used  to  enable our youth to become drivers of economic growth and industrial development.\nLet me emphasize that excluding women from certain spheres of life is to waste skills and expertise that could otherwise contribute to sustainable development. In that context, we applaud the Secretary-General for exercising leadership and for reaching gender parity  in the Secretariat among senior management and resident coordinators. Namibia is fully committed to implementing gender equality, which is evident in the important role that women play in our politics. The late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan was right when he said at the Conference on African Women and Economic Development in Addis Ababa in April 1998,\n\u201cGender equality is more than a goal in itself. It is a precondition for meeting the challenge of reducing poverty, promoting sustainable development and building good governance\u201d.\nThe world  should do  more to make gender equality   a reality.\nWhile we commend the Secretary-General on his successful reform initiatives, I remind the Assembly of the historic commitment that we all made at the 2005 World Summit\n\u201cto strengthen the United  Nations  with  a  view to enhancing its authority and efficiency [and] address effectively ... the full range of challenges of our time\u201d (resolution 60/1, para. 146).\nIt is time to ensure that we live up to that pledge. In that regard, it is pertinent to demonstrate the political will of the United  Nations  membership with regard  to redressing Africa\u2019s exclusion from the Security\n \nCouncil. The world has moved on, and the old and unjust order cannot persist. Africa and its 1.2 billion inhabitants can no longer be excluded from assuming their place on that primary decision-making body.\nFor Africa and the rest of the developing world, peace is the main foundation for and guarantor of sustainable economic growth and development. As leaders, together with the citizenry of the great African continent, we need to understand that it is our collective responsibility to maintain peace so as to enable Africa to unlock its full potential. Every step that advances   a peaceful Africa should be welcomed. In that vein, we commend His Excellency Mr. Abiy Ahmed, Prime Minister of Ethiopia, and his Eritrean counterpart, His Excellency President Isaias Afwerki, for signing an agreement to end the war between their two countries and for the subsequent resumption of diplomatic and trade ties. I am confident that that spirit of unity, peace and security, as embodied in the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, will spread throughout the Horn of Africa and all areas afflicted by conflict in Africa.\nNamibia is a child of international solidarity, in whose birth the United Nations served as midwife. We relied on the solidarity of the nations of the world to support us in our quest to achieve our self-determination. In that connection, we call for the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions on the Western Sahara, which will lead to a positive, peaceful and permanent solution that meets the aspirations and will of the people of that area. In the same vein, we reaffirm our support for the people of the occupied territory of Palestine in their pursuit of self-determination, justice, freedom and independence.\nDuring the darkest days of our fight for independence, the Government and the people of Cuba joined Angola in coming to our aid and shedding their blood for our liberation, which led to the decisive battle of Cuito Cuanavale and the resulting negotiations, elections and, eventually, freedom. It is in that spirit of profound kinship that we share with the Cuban people that we renew our call for lifting the decades-old, outdated, ineffective and counterproductive economic and financial embargo on Cuba. It is now time for all of us to demonstrate the leadership required to bring prosperity and  peace  to  all  of  the  world\u2019s  people. It is time to lead in the spirit of peace, equality and sustainability. It is time to make the United Nations relevant to all of the world\u2019s people. Let us seize this unique moment in history.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to address the General Assembly on behalf  of Montenegro, one of the youngest members of the United Nations, which, since the restoration of its statehood 12 years ago, has clearly and unequivocally confirmed its commitment to joint action within the United Nations system.\nAt the outset, allow me to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s of Ecuador on her election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session, and to wish her success in carrying out the responsibilities and duties of the post. I also want to thank the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his outstanding leadership and contribution to strengthening the role of the General Assembly and stepping up dialogue with Member States. I congratulate him on another job well done, and express gratitude for the lasting friendship he has shown towards Montenegro.\nI welcome the theme chosen for the general  debate of the seventy-third session. I firmly believe that in these challenging times concerted action and shared responsibility for peaceful, just and sustainable societies are the right and only way towards achieving our goal of making the United Nations relevant to all people on the planet.\nGiven the complex situations and challenges that the world is facing, the grave divisions for numerous reasons, the catastrophic consequences of the spread of terrorism and violent extremism, as well as climate change, there is no question that only through joint action can we succeed in resolving conflicts and preventing the further suffering of innocent people.\n \nThe historic multilateral agreements that we have made in recent times show what we can do through joint action. These agreements, primarily the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, envisage our common future and confirm that multilateralism is not an option but the only effective tool in our toolbox.\nFor the full implementation of the adopted agreements, reforming the United Nations and strengthening  its central  role   in   multilateralism are more necessary than ever. This seventy-third session is therefore of paramount importance for restoring confidence in the United Nations. Indeed, notwithstanding the sometimes justified criticism directed at the Organization, it is capable of achieving the noble objectives for which it was founded. It cannot be said that these lofty goals have been achieved in today\u2019s world, but neither do we have to hide that fact. We must look the problem in the eye and assume our share of responsibility for the state of today\u2019s \u2014 and tomorrow\u2019s \u2014 world.\nMontenegro strongly supports the United Nations reform process. I am confident that the issue of fragmentation within the Organization can be settled by strengthening the linkages among all three pillars of action and by promoting greater transparency, efficiency and accountability. I believe that the implementation of the complex reform agenda, coupled with the strong leadership of Secretary-General Guterres, will result in a more efficient Organization and contribute to reducing suffering throughout the world and ensuring common peace, security and prosperity.\nI would like to remind the General Assembly of Montenegro\u2019s views, in a nutshell, on some of the key topics on the agenda of this session of the Assembly. First of all, Montenegro is strongly committed to the policy underlying the Sustainable Development Goals and the work being done to achieve those Goals, which complement the reforms that we have undertaken in our European integration process. Furthermore, although its share in global emissions and population statistics is small, Montenegro is committed to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement through the responsible and sustainable management of its development potential. Montenegro welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-General to hold a climate  change  summit in 2019.\nIn terms of finding solutions to conflicts all around the world, we are aware that the international community often fails to prevent crime and the suffering of many. In addition to what we have learned from the long-standing conflict in Syria, the findings of the commission of inquiry into human rights violations in Myanmar also warn of the importance of prevention and addressing the causes of instability in a timely manner. It is our moral and political responsibility to prevent impunity for the perpetrators of the crimes committed. In this regard, the role of the Security Council, the International Criminal Court and other criminal tribunals is crucial.\nMontenegro deplores the stalemate in settling the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the lack of progress in resolving the worsening humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. Today we call on all parties to uphold international law and refrain from unilateral actions that weaken confidence and make it difficult to reach a mutually acceptable peace agreement. We strongly support the resumption of negotiations and the use of mediation in striving to reach a peaceful solution.\nConflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya and other countries, as well as the long-standing Palestinian- Israeli conflict, require an immediate end to violence, respect for international law on the part of all parties to the conflict and peaceful settlements achieved through diplomatic means as soon as possible. In order to eradicate terrorism and violent extremism, we must step up efforts to strengthen the implementation of the prevention pillar of the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy. The focus of our activities must be on the integration of vulnerable and marginalized groups and care for young people as the main stakeholders in a better future.\nWe strongly support global efforts aimed at disarmament and the  non-proliferation  of  weapons of mass destruction. I am certain that through the consistent application of the relevant treaties on nuclear disarmament and arms control, we can achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world. We therefore support the activities of the United States of America, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea aimed at ensuring the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\nI will now touch on two very important and intertwined aspects of today\u2019s world: human rights and humanitarian challenges.\n \nAny violation of human rights poses a threat to democracy and the rule of law and represents a step towards possible conflict. At a time when we are commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the twenty-fifth of the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the twentieth of the adoption of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, we are witnessing an increasing number of examples of grave human rights violations around the world. It is unacceptable that we remain silent about this fact. In addressing these situations, we acknowledge the important role of the Human Rights Council and the need for it to be more efficient and effective in its functions in order to build on the results achieved so far. A  strong and determined commitment to taking  a progressive approach to human rights is necessary, as is improving our record in adhering to the highest standards at all levels.\nWith respect to the protection and promotion of human rights at the national level, significant progress has been made in the protection of women, children and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations, and in the integration of marginalized  groups.  We aim to strengthen and expand our national human rights dialogue, which should contribute to improved adherence to international standards. Montenegro\u2019s commitment to the issue of gender equality and the fight against violence against women has been reaffirmed by our chairmanship of the Executive Board of UN- Women. We strongly advocate greater roles for women as leaders, high-level decision-makers and stakeholders in conflict prevention, resolution and reconciliation.\nAlthough humanitarian challenges are on the  rise, I want to emphasize the importance of two key multilateral agreements that have arisen under the auspices of the United Nations, the global compacts  on migration and refugees. The adoption of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration will contribute to the improved management of international migration in all dimensions, to the benefit of all States and communities, including migrants. Our Government is working in all areas to better regulate migration processes and is doing everything it can to enable the admission of migrants and refugees in accordance with international standards in this area, while taking into account its own national capacities. Bearing in mind our experience in admitting a large number of refugees during the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s, we have helped\nto develop the global compact on refugees, which we believe will contribute to the international community\u2019s joint action to regulate the mass movement of refugees and provide support to destination countries.\nIn the past 12 years, since the restoration of our independence, we have made rapid progress in the State-building process on the basis of lofty democratic values. Our results are not just a product of political pragmatism but a vision of a modern Montenegro geared to the stability and prosperity of its citizens.\nMontenegro is a new member of NATO, having joined it last year.  We  are aware of  the necessity for  a safe and secure environment and are committed to dealing with the issues of global security and the preservation and enhancement of common values within both NATO and United Nations peacekeeping missions. Membership in NATO has given us a strong incentive to further strengthen the rule of law based on the highest democratic values.\nAt the same time, we are vigorously implementing economic reforms that have resulted in a high economic growth rate of more than 4.5 per cent last year and in the first half of this year. The reforms are based on principles of sustainable development that will secure higher living standards for our people in the longer term.\nAt the moment, Montenegro is a front runner among the Western Balkan States engaged in the process of joining the European Union. Among other things, we have earned this position because multinational and multireligious harmony has been a historical feature of our country and our greatest value. We are committed to strengthening institutions and making them sustainable, and are determined to win the fight against organized crime and corruption.\nBefore concluding, I would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the current situation in my region. The Western Balkans is now a better place to live than 20 or 30 years ago, owing to the efforts of  the international community and the Governments of the countries of the region. We in Montenegro believe that there is no better future for our citizens  than being integrated into the European Union. We are also confident that this choice is also natural for Europe. In our view, European values are the best \u2014 indeed, the only \u2014 answer to growing nationalism and populism. However, in order to achieve the goal of furthering European values, decisive action must be taken based\n \non a clear vision of wholeness, stability and strength in every corner of Europe.\nMontenegro will remain committed to promoting regional stability and cooperation and developing good neighbourly relations. In that regard, we welcome the signing of the historic agreement between Macedonia and Greece, which contributes to broadening the European and Euro-Atlantic perspective of the region. We hope for the successful implementation of the agreement reached, which will be conducive to creating an environment favourable to the further overall development of the region.\nWe also welcome the negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina. We believe that in the coming period it will result in the achievement of a lasting agreement and the full normalization of relations, which is in the interest of both the region and Europe.\nMontenegro will continue to be a responsible partner as it works together with the United Nations. Through its membership in the organs and agencies of the United Nations, it will contribute to United Nations efforts aimed at addressing global challenges. In addition to its membership in and chairing of the Executive Board of UN-Women, Montenegro has submitted its candidacy for membership in the Economic and Social Council for the period from 2020 to 2022, the Human Rights Council for the period from 2022 to 2024 and the Security Council for a term from 2026 to 2027.\nWe believe that we will gain the support and confidence of the States Members of the United Nations in those bodies, which will be an opportunity to contribute to stronger and more effective United Nations action. The key interests  of  our  countries  are shared \u2014 they are greater peace, security and prosperity for our citizens. In this respect, the United Nations must continue to play a strong role.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it is my pleasure, on behalf of the Government and people of the State of Kuwait, to extend my sincere congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session on her election, as well as to her friendly country, Ecuador. I would also like to reassure her of our full support in facilitating her work and fulfilling her responsibilities. We are fully confident of her ability to undertake that task, as her experience in international affairs will have a positive impact on conducting this session\u2019s work.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express my country\u2019s sincere appreciation for the outstanding efforts of her predecessor during his able and successful presidency throughout the previous session.\nAllow me  also to commend the great efforts of  the Secretary-General in leading the Organization with visions and ideas for the maintenance of international peace and security based on the purposes and principles of the Charter. We firmly support his reform initiatives, particularly those relating to ways to settle conflicts peacefully, which promote practical rather than theoretical preventive diplomacy. That would be achieved through a United Nations plan that ensures consensus on effective reforms in order for the international organization to play its desired role.\nPreventing and resolving conflicts by peaceful means continue to be one of the most important reasons for the establishment of the United Nations. After the bloody experiences of the First and Second World\n \nWars, despite their unprecedented and catastrophic consequences for humankind, those wars constituted the genuine motivation for developing a meaningful international system to protect our present and future generations from the scourge of war.\nThe United Nations has played a critical and historical role in the past seven decades, during which it has developed its working methods and expanded its mandates to include humanitarian, political, security, development and economic issues throughout the world. However, growing challenges, increasingly severe conflicts and the risks that they pose for international peace and security have shown the urgent need to enhance the ability of the United Nations to adequately respond to the challenges facing our world today. Those challenges include the spread of violence, extremism and terrorism, as well as the  dangers pertaining to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the continuous violations of human rights, climate change and others.\nThe proposals and plans that the Secretary-General has introduced to restructure the Secretariat, with a view to enhancing its effectiveness and increasing its efficiency in order to ensure that its efforts in ending conflicts are not wasted, are a preliminary important step to transform the issue of reform from hypothetical discussion to realistic application. In that regard, we stress once again our support for that step, which is part of the expectations that the peoples of the world have of the Organization, considered to be a safe haven and guarantor of global peace and stability.\nNine months into our non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the period 2018-2019, the State of Kuwait has become increasingly aware of the need to reform the Security Council to make it more capable of shouldering its responsibilities and facing the growing challenges of today\u2019s world. The reform must reflect the international reality in which we live and strengthen the credibility and legitimacy of the Security Council, while ensuring permanent Arab representation commensurate with the number of Arab Member States and the size of their contribution to the various activities of the United Nations.\nSince its first day as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, the State of Kuwait has adopted an objective approach in addressing various issues on the Council\u2019s agenda. Such an approach is a realistic reflection of its foreign policy, which is based on\nrespect for the sovereignty and independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs. We also believe in the noble objective of the United Nations, which is that of maintaining international peace and security. Our involvement in the Security Council\u2019s agenda was not constrained by any cultural, ethnic, political or geographical consideration, although its agenda is replete with Middle Eastern issues.\nThrough our non-permanent membership of the Security Council, the State of Kuwait seeks to go beyond routine participation in the work of the Council. We aim to broaden our horizons in order to elevate the sovereignty of international law, with all its branches, including respect for human rights, building a better future for the world\u2019s population and avoiding any selectivity or partiality in addressing the various issues. That trend is based on the Charter of the United Nations and on the diplomatic legacy of the State of  Kuwait.  It gives preference to achieving peaceful solutions and promoting mediation efforts between parties. It reflects how we address the various issues and crises ravaging our world today. Human beings and their inherent rights remain the pillars of our foreign policy, based on the directives of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah \u2014 may God protect him \u2014 the Emir of the State of Kuwait, who was honoured by the Organization as a leader of humanitarian work.\nThe Palestinian question is one of the most important and long-standing issues on the agenda of the Security Council. This year marks the seventieth anniversary of the adoption in August 1948 of Security Council resolution 56 (1948). It was the first time the Council addressed that protracted issue. Successive resolutions were adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly, as well as multiple international and regional initiatives, to lay the foundations for peace in the Middle East. However, Israel persists in its intransigence and continues to reject and ignore resolutions of international legitimacy.  It  continues its expansionist policies through the establishment of illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian territories. Such action constitutes a significant challenge to and blatant disregard for implementing resolutions of international legitimacy, the most recent of which is resolution 2334 (2016), which calls on Israel to stop its illegal settlement practices.\nFurthermore, Israel continues to desecrate the sanctity of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, in addition to its continued violations of human rights and\n \ninternational humanitarian law, by detaining thousands of Palestinians in its prisons and detention centres and through its repeated military aggressions on the Gaza Strip, during which it does not take into account the protection of civilians in armed conflict. It disregards the agreed international measures under the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.\nGiven that the State of Kuwait seeks the full implementation of Security Council resolutions, we submitted a draft resolution at the Security Council in May, which repeatedly called on Israel, the occupying Power, to immediately cease the use of illegitimate force against civilians. That draft resolution also called for international protection to ensure the safety and security of Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories. Although the draft resolution was not adopted, the State of Kuwait will spare no effort to support the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people until the occupation ends and permanent, just and comprehensive peace is achieved, in accordance with the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative, while implementing all relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, which call for the two-State solution and the establishment of a Palestinian State, based on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe Syrian crisis has entered its eighth year. The international community remains to a large extent unable to find a solution that ends its devastating consequences and horrific losses. Syrian citizens have remained the main victims of a conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 400,000 people, in addition to more than 12 million people who have become refugees and displaced persons.\nThe State of Kuwait, in cooperation and coordination with the delegation of the friendly Kingdom of Sweden, put forward resolution 2401 (2018) on the humanitarian situation in Syria, which was unanimously adopted by the Security Council. It was a positive sign of the solidarity and unity of the Council to end that human suffering, stop the hostilities and guarantee humanitarian access to those in need in Syria in a timely manner. Yet, today we deplore the fact that resolution 2401 (2018) has not been implemented on the ground.\nSuch efforts take place in the context of the humanitarian role played by the State of Kuwait to\naddress the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Syria since the beginning of the crisis. In the course  of such efforts, we have hosted three international donor conferences to galvanize support to ease the humanitarian situation in Syria. My country  has made voluntary contributions totalling $1.6 billion at those conferences.\nIn that regard, we reiterate our principled and unwavering position with regard to the Syrian crisis. We reject any military solution to the crisis and stress the need to step up efforts to bring all parties to the conflict together and start a dialogue in order to reach a peaceful settlement, in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 2254 (2015). The goal is to achieve a political reality agreed upon by all components of the Syrian people. That should preserve the unity and independence of Syria in order to attain the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people and ensure that the perpetrators of crimes are brought to justice and enjoy no impunity.\nOur brothers in Yemen are facing critical unprecedented challenges, with serious  implications at the political, humanitarian and economic levels as a result of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the legitimate authorities by the Houthis in September 2014. The Houthis continue to reject the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as international initiatives to achieve a political settlement. They remain a threat to the security and stability of the region by launching ballistic missiles against the sisterly Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia. Such action threatens the safety of navigation at Bab al-Mandab strait and the Red Sea. We strongly condemn such actions, which are contrary to international law and international humanitarian law.\nIn that regard, we underscore  once  again  our  full commitment to respecting Yemen\u2019s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, while rejecting interference in Yemeni internal affairs. We stress our full support for the constitutional legitimacy of Yemen, as the cradle of Arab civilization. We also stress the importance of prioritizing the  political  solution  to the crisis by resorting to the three agreed terms of reference: the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the Comprehensive National Dialogue and the relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 2216 (2015).\n \nGiven Kuwait\u2019s preventive diplomacy, which is based on mediation and political settlement, for over\n100 days in 2016 my country hosted the political consultations between the Yemeni parties, under the auspices of the United Nations. We underscore our readiness to host our Yemeni brethren for the signing of a final agreement whenever it is reached by Yemeni parties. We stress our ongoing support for the efforts of the United Nations and those of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen to achieve a peaceful solution to the crisis without delay.\nThe coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Yemen\u2019s legitimacy has consequences that play a major role in the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the country. Such consequences have led to frightening and unprecedented statistics. In fact, the Yemeni people continue to suffer, as they struggle to survive daily. The State of Kuwait has not ignored the needs of its brothers in Yemen. We have contributed a total of $350 million. We pledged\n$250 million of that amount at the Geneva conference in April, where it was handed over in full to the United Nations agencies and its humanitarian bodies. The purpose of that contribution was to mitigate the serious deterioration at the humanitarian, health and economic levels. However, that deterioration will not stop until security and stability in Yemen are restored, which will in turn help to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity and re-establish harmony among all groups in the country.\nThe growing phenomenon of terrorism and violent extremism in the world, particularly in the Middle East, is an unprecedented challenge that has stricken the world order at its core. It has happened through the ideologies of secretive and rogue organizations, under the cloak of Islam, to achieve their destructive intentions.\nThe so-called Da\u2019esh terrorist organization has perpetrated savage crimes, including widespread murder and destruction in various areas of the region. In response, the Global Coalition against Da\u2019esh was established, a development for which the State of Kuwait has provided material and moral support, in line with the conventions on combating terrorism adopted by the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations from 1999 to 2001. Our brothers in Iraq were the first to suffer from the crimes of that terrorist organization. Cooperation between the international community, represented by the Security Council and the Government of Iraq, has\nplayed a highly effective role in clearing Iraqi territories of that terrorist and dangerous cancer.\nProceeding from our conviction that post-war peace and security cannot be achieved without  redressing the impact of conflicts and their devastating effects, which undermine humankind, my country hosted the International Conference for the Reconstruction of Iraq. At that conference, pledges exceeded $30 billion, of which the State of Kuwait contributed $2 billion. In that regard, we underscore our firm position in favour of providing all forms of support in order to assist Iraq in fulfilling its outstanding commitments under the relevant Security Council resolutions and restoring its role and position in the region and the world.\nAt the regional level, and based on the same principles of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations and international law, we once again call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to adopt serious confidence-building measures to establish relations based on cooperation, mutual respect and common interests. That would serve to direct efforts and capabilities towards promoting development and construction, and would reflect the hopes of all peoples in the region for a life of security and stability.\nWhile confirming what I said earlier about the role that my country has been playing, which is based on prioritizing humanitarian issues, and in response to the tragic situation facing the refugees of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, the State of Kuwait helped to organize the Security Council visit to Bangladesh and Myanmar. The aim of that visit was to discuss the refugee crisis, become familiar with the situation and assess the steps taken by the authorities of the two countries towards one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. We will pursue our efforts, as a member of the Security Council, to cooperate and coordinate with all parties concerned in order to guarantee the safe, voluntary and dignified return of the refugees and hold accountable all those responsible for crimes committed against them.\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is one of the most successful achievements of the United Nations. It complements the efforts of the international community based on the fundamental rules emanating from the Millennium Development Goals, which achieved their noble objectives and spurred the United Nations to shift from defining relative goals\n \nfor confronting challenges to a comprehensive phase of radical and people-centred solutions.\nMeeting our international obligations and achieving global solidarity represent a major leap towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals in order to eradicate poverty in all its forms; ensure that all human beings enjoy equal rights to dignity, education, health and political participation; empower young people and women; and address the effects of climate change in the context of the historic Paris Agreement. Environmental degradation is one of the main obstacles to attaining those Goals, in accordance with the principle of shared responsibility, taking into account the different responsibilities and burdens.\nThe issue of migrants and refugees is perhaps one of the most prominent challenges facing sustainable development. We therefore look forward to the 2018 international conference on migration, to be held in the city of Marrakech in December, at which the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration will  be adopted.\nAs the State of Kuwait seeks to improve the welfare of people, we have taken effective measures  to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a priority of all our national plans and programmes, with the participation of all sectors of society. That was embodied in the future national vision for a new Kuwait to be accomplished by 2035, seeking to transform Kuwait into a leading regional, financial, commercial, cultural and institutional centre.\nThe State of Kuwait has always shouldered its regional and international responsibilities to achieve development in its various economic, social and environmental dimensions. We have made major strides in implementing the initiatives of His Highness the Emir of the State of Kuwait to promote international partnerships. Such partnerships complement the ongoing history of Kuwait in the development and humanitarian fields. In fact, Kuwait spared no effort in offering development assistance to developing countries, as well as to least developed countries, totalling 106 countries to date. We play  our role  as an active Member of the United Nations through our various institutions, in particular the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. We provide grants and soft loans for infrastructure projects in developing countries. Such assistance is more than double the internationally agreed upon percentage.\nI would like to underscore that the State of Kuwait is committed to the international multilateral system and to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We believe in the importance and necessity  of advancing all efforts to guarantee the continuity and contribution of our long-standing  Organization by having all States fulfil their commitments and responsibilities under international conventions and conferences. That will  contribute  to finding  fair  and just solutions to global threats  and  challenges and to accomplishing the lofty goal of maintaining international peace and security."

I congratulate Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k on his leadership of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. He worked tirelessly together with Secretary-General Guterres to make the Organization more effective. I am glad that the agenda for this year\u2019s session will maintain a focus on those efforts.\nI congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election. The fact that she is only the fourth woman to hold the presidency of the General Assembly since 1946 is a reminder that gender equality and the empowerment of women must remain our top priority.\nTwo years ago, from this rostrum (see A/71/PV.12), I reflected on a number of ways and means to make our world more just and prosperous for all. Standing here today, I do not see much to rejoice about in terms of the progress we have made. Challenges have continued to multiply uncontrollably. Old conflicts have been magnified and new ones created. When compared to the past three decades, more countries are now engulfed in crises that are more violent and disruptive and result in ever greater divides. Those modern crises and conflicts are rarely confined to their place of origin. They shake entire regions and often proliferate further into the transnational arena.\nRecord numbers of civilians are victims of indiscriminate yet deliberate armed attacks. Many more are subjected to persecution, discrimination, marginalization and violations of basic human rights. Many others fall victim to natural disasters. The number of refugees, displaced persons and those in dire need of humanitarian assistance continues to rise.\nIt is through that lens that I want to reflect on three issues that are critical to addressing the global problems that we face \u2014 multilateralism, international law and the rules-based international order. I believe that adherence to multilateralism, compliance with international law and shared commitment to the rules- based global order is our only hope and the only way to resolve the complex challenges that confront us.\nWhether it be conflict prevention or resolution, security, development, climate change, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, migration or human rights,\n \nnone of these problems can be successfully addressed or resolved by one, three or five  countries  alone.  Each and every one of those issues has transnational dimensions. Effective responses require an  exercise in responsibility and respect for agreed international norms and standards, strong coalitions based on mutual trust, and progressive, inclusive and democratic vision and leadership that embrace a new understanding of national sovereignty.\nYet today we are witnessing  severe  attacks  on the rules-based international order and the purposes, principles and norms of international law, which threaten to seriously undermine international peace and security. There are plenty of examples in our recent past that show what disregard for international law and the rules-based international order can bring. Those dark chapters of our history were a direct result of the community of nations failing to uphold the rules and norms on which our world order has been based when those very same rules and norms were challenged.\nOur citizens want to live in a peaceful world in which human dignity is respected and fundamental human rights and freedoms are  protected.  That  is  the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Organization. That obligation goes far beyond our national borders or interests. No Government can focus only on delivering stability and prosperity to its own people while ignoring what goes on beyond its national borders, in its neighbourhood and in the wider world. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt, the structure for meeting any of the numerous challenges we face, including building and sustaining world peace, cannot be the work of one man or one nation large or small, but must be the cooperative effort of the whole world. Those words resonate today in the same way they did over seven decades ago.\nCooperative approaches have been key to eliminating smallpox,  vaccinating  record  numbers of infants against preventable diseases and beating back the menace of AIDS. Concerted efforts and the alliance of all nations are necessary to contain the risks of nuclear confrontation and successfully address global issues such as gender equality, climate change or the prosecution of war criminals at the international level. The spirit of multilateralism is  essential  in order to achieve and maintain peace, security and development around the world. A man who championed multilateralism in his lifelong work on the world stage, former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, once said:\n\u201cMore than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that ... is why we have the United Nations.\u201d\nWe must reaffirm this Organization of unified nations as the  true  embodiment  of  multilateralism. It is the only forum that brings together almost 200 countries to seek joint solutions to global problems that affect us all. It is the only forum that has the capacity, dedication and compassion to  solve  those  problems. It is the only forum where the voices of both big and small countries can be heard equally, even if all of those voices are not always equally acknowledged. Bosnia and Herzegovina is strongly committed to the preservation and strengthening of the United Nations, its values and principles, its missions and mandates, and its relevance, credibility and cohesion.\nTime and again, we must remind ourselves of the fundamental values and principles that are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and that embody the essence of the rules-based international order. Those principles and values remain as relevant today as they were in 1945. The primary responsibility of the Organization and all its States Members is to uphold and protect those commitments in the face of the modern challenges that profoundly test them.\nThe strong leadership and engagement of the United Nations, in particular its Security Council, in line with the norms of international law, are indispensable in situations such as those in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and Libya, and in other  crisis  areas.  Yet  our  responses to modern crises and conflicts have unfortunately been marked by a disregard for international law, departures from multilateralism and a failure to adhere to the rules-based international order, by inaction and indifference to human suffering and violations of basic human rights.\nLet us look at the Middle East, for example. The conflict in Syria has entered its eighth year, and we are nowhere close to bringing it to a resolution. Some of the most sustained violations of international humanitarian law in modern times, including the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons, have gone unabated. Civilian casualties are constantly on the rise. The humanitarian situation keeps deteriorating.\nThe same applies to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has lasted for more than half a century and brought about immense human suffering. Holding\n \na region hostage, as individual national interests compromise the interests of civilians who are caught in endless cycles of violence, is unacceptable.\nBosnia and Herzegovina will continue to support multilateral efforts to find solutions that will bring sustained peace and stability to the Syrian people and meet the legitimate expectations of both the Israelis and Palestinians of having two democratic States, living side by side within secure and recognized borders, in line with international law. As much as finding such solutions is a political question, it is also a matter of our common humanity.\nOur shared ambition to leave no one behind is also put at serious risk by the evolving threat of radicalization, violent extremism and terrorism. That modern scourge easily finds fuel to sustain it not only in armed conflicts but also in social and political injustices, discrimination, marginalization and exclusion, poverty, unemployment and economic disadvantage.\nViolent extremism and terrorism transcend physical and virtual borders. They constantly change tactics and invent new ways and means to spread. Extremists and terrorists remain intent on driving a wedge between and within societies, hindering our efforts to maintain peace and security, protect human rights and foster sustainable development. Our response must therefore be decisive, coherent, comprehensive and grounded in the international counter-terrorism framework that we have created. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains strongly committed to contributing to global efforts to counter and eradicate that modern menace in all its forms and manifestations. This is a profound challenge of our time that needs to be confronted at every step and by every means at our disposal.\nThe United Nations peacebuilding architecture remains as important as ever in addressing all the challenges that persist on the path towards sustainable peace around the world. We recognize the value of introducing the United Nations peacebuilding efforts at an early stage, alongside peacekeeping activities. Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the vision and efforts of Secretary-General Guterres to mainstream conflict prevention and peacebuilding as priorities of the United Nations.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is proud of its contribution to those goals through our participation in the United Nations peacekeeping missions in South Sudan, Cyprus, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and Mali. We have joined more than 130 other countries and organizations in endorsing the Secretary- General\u2019s Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations. We support his efforts to make the United Nations peacekeeping missions stronger and more effective.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the most powerful connector among the various pillars of the United Nations work. Its implementation is the most important pathway to global peace, security and prosperity. It will help States and societies establish resilient institutions that are able to detect, manage and absorb tensions; address and eliminate the root causes of conflicts and prevent their recurrence and create conditions for inclusive and sustainable development by reducing poverty, inequality and discrimination, ensuring respect for human rights and combating environmental degradation. The 2030 Agenda is a catalyst for sustainable and inclusive development rooted in respect for economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. We believe that it is the best way to prevent conflicts and instability.\nStrong global and regional cooperation, whether on matters of conflict prevention and resolution, the fight against terrorism or the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, is essential to the success of all those efforts. Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly values the cooperation we have  established  within  our  region of the Western Balkans. We remain committed to advancing that cooperation, including on our joint path towards membership in the European Union.\nBosnia and Herzegovina strives for the protection and promotion of values and principles that are shared by all countries. We believe that the ideals, values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and standards inscribed in international law should never be violated or disregarded. We believe that it is the obligation of all countries \u2014 big and small, powerful or less powerful \u2014 to uphold the noble values and principles on which the Organization is built. If any of us lacks the will to uphold those values and principles, then all our endeavours will be less valuable and less successful.\nOn that note, I leave the Assembly with the words of a great man, Nelson Mandela, as we mark the centenary of his birth,\n\u201cWhat counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the\n \nlives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "This summer we lost a great man, Kofi Annan. He stood for the need for Member States to be united in our approach if we wish to achieve the goals of the United Nations. That is why I am here addressing the General Assembly today, because I believe that global problems require global solutions. Advocating a global approach does not mean loving your country less than others. It means that working together makes it less likely that a might-is-right doctrine will prevail. Furthermore, better solutions can be found together, rather than alone.\nIn order to find solutions we must remain committed to communicating and understanding one another. Whatever challenges we need to address and however different each nation\u2019s views and perspectives are, we have a better chance at solving them as a united force, rather than divided or on our own. Malta, being a member of both the European Union and the Commonwealth, knows only too well that no single nation, big or small, can tackle global problems alone.\nThe trend of nations drifting towards reactions based only on their own borders is a worrying one. Some,\n \nunfortunately, are wanting to solve global issues with local solutions, which, as many here recognize, can at best give the illusion of working for a limited period of time, and at worst lead to almost immediate implosion.\nWe must, of course, respect the sovereignty of all nations, and we have no right to stand here before the Assembly hoping to judge others. But those who are closing themselves off from debate believe falsely that they can escape certain issues. We are seeing divisions not just among global leaders or nations, but within our own societies, neighbourhoods and even families. Local solutions breed global problems, which then manifest themselves with devastating results, from the use of plastic products that are polluting our seas to the point that they are killing our sea life, to mass migrations and the effect of displacement on both migrants and host societies, where there are vulnerable people on both sides.\nI mention those examples because both of them have hit us particularly hard in Malta and in the Mediterranean Sea. The latter is visible to all. We are in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, in the middle of the route between North Africa, Libya and mainland Europe, the centre of a journey that thousands of people have undertaken in recent years. We have been grappling with complexities that have existed for years \u2014 much longer than has been recognized on a priority basis by the international community \u2014 and that have dominated media headlines in Europe and beyond. Although crossings through the central Mediterranean have decreased in the past year, the concerns of our populations have grown. And many feel the international community has failed to provide solutions for them. That has given rise to movements that preach simplistic solutions to complex problems.\nWhat can surely be stopped, if we have a unified approach, are the criminal gangs profiting from smuggling human beings.  With  a  global  strategy that can deliver incisive blows to migrant smugglers, we can disrupt their online recruitment efforts, their payment methods and their supply of sea vessels. Most important, working together, we can stop the people profiting from a practice that has often resulted in the deaths of so many innocent people.\nMalta is a small State that has one of the highest rates of economic growth in Europe and in the world, but that also ranks among the highest worldwide in terms of the number of asylum applications per capita. Despite that, our humanitarian response is still fully in\nline with our international commitments. That is also true for Malta\u2019s embarkation policy, which has been consistent and clear. And we expect others, not only States but also the non-State actors involved, to abide by international rules.\nIn recent weeks \u2014 because of the actions of a few who have not abided by the relevant conventions \u2014 Malta had to bring together like-minded nations with a humanitarian conscience to offer a place of safety for stranded migrants. We had no legal obligation to do so, but we did it in a spirit of seeking unified solutions. And it proved that when solidarity works, complex issues can often have simple solutions. Although I am under no illusion and know that this was just a temporary respite in a much bigger problem, such actions could provide a foundation for long-term solutions, if all European Union member States could come together in a solution resembling a Bretton Woods-style institutional arrangement for addressing and managing migration with international support.\nThe soon to be adopted global compact on migration, which aims to establish a new global migration governance architecture on the principle of shared international responsibilities and solidarity, is a welcome move in the right direction. But it is a milestone on the road rather than the end of the road. We must now walk the talk by engaging in operational action.\nNarratives that use inflated or false facts and thrive on a nation\u2019s fear of openness have led to painful outcomes in history, not only producing the obvious effects but also affecting the dynamics of international relationships, which overflow into other issues with devastating results. The current surge in nationalism and tighter border controls threatens to do just that, with the potential for obstructing democratic decisions fuelling extremism of all kinds.\nHowever, let us take some comfort in knowing that in the 73 years of the existence of the United Nations, the going has always been tough. In fact, those who have stood where I am standing today have faced  much worse crises, from wars and famines to injustice and killer diseases. But through unified approaches, solutions were found and nations survived. Each time we came together we emerged stronger as an institution, as a global community. We currently live in a world with fewer wars and more dialogue and cooperation than ever before.\n \nBut our work is not done, and it probably never will be. Although fewer people live in extreme poverty, that scourge has not been eradicated. We have found solutions to many life-threatening diseases, yet cures are still needed for others. Injustice remains, and climate change could be the greatest threat to life in our history. As we solve one issue, another replaces it. That is life. However, the important thing is that we continue to strive and work towards the greater good. But we can only do that together.\nOne way forward that Malta advocates is the harnessing of new technologies, which offer endless possibilities. We are currently in exciting technological times. With the lightning pace of current technological advances, each incredible piece of innovation could hold a new solution to problems that may have persisted for decades \u2014 from advanced robotics and artificial intelligence to 3D printing and the Internet of things.\nClearly, the fast and obvious transition to the digital economy and society poses challenges, which have to do with the very nature of concepts that we believed would stay as they were forever. One of them is the nature of work \u2014 how we envisage it, how we compensate it, how we maximize its efficiency and how the State creates new safety nets. That is a conversation that has just started globally, but that will shape public debate during our lifetime.\nWe can take the antagonistic view that technological progress is bad for us, that it will lead to new types of poverty, that it will strip people of their rights or even take decisions out of our hands. While such concerns may serve the needs of some politicians in the short term, and even appeal to well-meaning people who are afraid that progress will cost them their jobs or even more, such an approach is as myopic as advocating in the past that horse-drawn carts should not be replaced by motor vehicles.\nWhether we are talking about immigration or technology, we do not arrive at solutions by closing doors. The digital economy should be seen as an opportunity, but we must realize that we  cannot  do the best job of harnessing its opportunities without evolving the current social contracts we have in place. Those who will be able to pair the digital economy with a new State, the digital State, will be best poised to have a future-proof society in which change does not galvanize extremes but helps to ensure further decades of sensible, mainstream policymaking and prosperity.\nThen there are the other big questions for which the dawn of the digital age requires answers. Can we solve diplomatic negotiations that are at a stalemate by applying algorithms that can avoid war? Can we disarm terrorists by using the latest technologies? Is it possible to know immediately which remote parts of our planet need international humanitarian assistance? Could we create new organs for people so that no one on a waiting list dies for lack of a donor? Can we look forward to the day when humankind can be told that there is a cure for all cancers?\nOnly time will tell. But it is the accessibility of advanced technologies that will lead to solutions, hopefully for the whole world. I believe passionately that technology can revolutionize and improve systems. That is why we have launched Malta as the blockchain island by being the first jurisdiction worldwide to regulate that new technology, which previously existed in a legal vacuum. Blockchain makes cryptocurrencies, the inevitable future of money, more transparent, since it helps to separate good business from bad.\nBut such distributed-ledger technologies can do much more. They can provide solutions to health-  care systems in which patients have  real ownership  of their medical records. Emissions-trading systems can be taken to the next level. We can help to verify that humanitarian assistance is reaching its intended destination. We can make sure that people are not deprived of their legitimate property because of compromised data. Corporations will be able to become more accountable to their shareholders. States will have to move from hoarding information on citizens  to regulating an environment where citizens trust the handling of their data.\nThose are just a few of the ways in which we can counter regressive and reactionary politics. This forum shows that we stand to gain through dialogue and cooperation, which will always triumph over division and self-absorption because in unity we can have hope.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it is my pleasure to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I wish her every success in discharging her duties in that role. I would also like to express my appreciation to her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, who steered the work of the previous session with wisdom and efficiency.\nLast year, from this rostrum, I addressed the General Assembly on the situation in my country, Iraq (see A/72/PV.20). In the years prior to that, Da\u2019esh had occupied a third of Iraq\u2019s territory, burned everything in sight, destroyed monuments in Nineveh \u2014 dating back to the time when my country was the cradle of civilization \u2014 as well as the Mosque of the Prophet Yunus, expelled 6  million Iraqis from the  provinces it occupied, preyed on the Yazidi religious minority  by kidnapping its women, drove out ethnic Turkmen from Tal Afar and killed Shia men and women there by burning them alive.\nAll of that could have been a catastrophe of historic proportions from which we could never recover. However, although despair had seized the hearts and minds of many, there were still many of us whose full faith in God never wavered. Many of us were confident that the determination of Iraqi men and women of all ages and the intelligence of our leaders could turn the tide. The people of Iraq, of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds, came together to defend their country. They shed their blood on the battlefield and made immense sacrifices to liberate the lands occupied by Da\u2019esh. Thousands in the ranks of the heroic Iraqi armed forces, police and popular militias were martyred or injured, as were members of the Peshmerga, counter-terrorism forces and other groups. We led that fight with honour on behalf of the entire world, with the support of the international coalition against Da\u2019esh and of our friends, brothers and neighbours. Every one of them deserves our full recognition, and Iraq will never forget those who stood by it.\nThat crucial historic battle took place at a time when the safety of the whole world was under attack. Terrorists\u2019 attempts to extend their reach to ever more\nparts of the planet attracted adherents representing more than 120 different nationalities. We thank God for the support of the international community, whose assistance made it possible for us to vanquish that ferocious enemy and put an end to the Da\u2019esh presence in Iraq. It is now on its last legs in its final stronghold, in Syria.\nI am addressing the General Assembly today as my country is leavings behind that period of war and entering a new one characterized by reconstruction and the return of the displaced persons who were driven from their homes and fled to various corners of the globe. In this new chapter in the history of  Iraq, we are working hard to strengthen State institutions, enhance participation in governance and build political and constitutional consensus in our national affairs, with a view to joining the club of democratic nations. We are abandoning sectarianism of  every kind and uniting people around respect for law and the Constitution. Most recently, as part of the democratic electoral cycle that has been in place since 2004, we held parliamentary elections. We will soon elect a new President of the Republic, who will in turn appoint a new Prime Minister whose principal task will be to form a Government responsible for fighting corruption and putting the country on a path to development and prosperity.\nAs I address the Assembly today, Iraqis in the Kurdistan region of Iraq are preparing for regional parliamentary elections, in accordance with our federal multiparty system. In the light of that, I call on the international community to honour the financial pledges made at the Kuwait International Conference for the Reconstruction of Iraq earlier this year, on the basis of our being a promising country and a cradle of civilization. Indeed, since Iraq sits at the crossroads of different civilizations, religions and nationalities, we are endowed with a wealth of traditions.\nThe military  victory over terrorism did not necessarily spell the end of terrorism.  Rather,  we have simply entered a new phase in our efforts to totally eradicate its causes. We should strive to create a strategic plan with economic, cultural and political dimensions so as to immunize communities against the dangers of the return of  terrorism.  We  should also address the issues that relate to young people, women and children, putting in place programmes to improve their standard of living, build capacity within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\n \nDevelopment and especially to tackle unemployment. We must also protect diversity, support minorities, maintain peace and security in liberated areas and move from national reconciliation to the strengthening of the national institutions in which all Iraqis have a stake.\nToday Iraqis are making every effort to move forward as a single, united geographical entity, rejecting all forms of division, foreign interference and partition. Most recently,  we  have  made  important  advances  in fighting terrorism, strengthening democracy and keeping to the schedule set for parliamentary elections. We continue to fight to protect human rights, political plurality and the freedom of expression, having enacted detailed legislation in those areas.\nIn standing by Iraq through the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), the United Nations has made significant sacrifices. As UNAMI continues to work to fulfil its mandate, I want to acknowledge the key role played by Mr. J\u00e1n Kubi\u0161, Special Representative and Head of the Mission, whose achievements in our country have been considerable. We also welcome the appointment of his successor, Ms. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, who is the first woman to be appointed Head of the Mission.\nWe continue to strive to end the effects of the war against terrorism on displaced persons by providing them with reparations, ensuring their return and collecting evidence for the crimes committed against them by the Da\u2019esh terrorist organization in Iraq. That work is being done through the commission that was set up pursuant to Security Council resolution 2379 (2017) to document the crimes committed by Da\u2019esh.\nThe Government of Iraq believes that the maintenance of international peace and security is the responsibility of all of us. We stress the importance  of ensuring that the international community continues to act to completely eliminate nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, with a view to guaranteeing the safety and security of future generations. We support the universalization of all treaties and conventions on disarmament, as they are the only concrete guarantee that there will be no use or threat of use of such weapons. Iraqis paid a heavy price when weapons of this kind were used against them during their time under dictatorship. The Assembly will recall that the inhabitants of the city of Halabja were victims of chemical weapons in one of the most egregious criminal acts in history, and that the Shia in\ncentral and southern Iraq were subjected to similarly egregious mass killings, as were members of other sects.\nMy Government is working to overcome the economic crisis by making the best possible  use  of  its resources, establishing economic partnerships and creating an environment  favourable  to  investment  in order to benefit from available opportunities and achieve sustainable economic development.\nIraq reaffirms its steadfast position with regard to the Palestinian question. We emphasize that there is no chance for peace in our region until Israel, the occupying Power, fully withdraws from the Palestinian and Arab occupied territories. We call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. We condemn the settlement policy pursued by the Israeli occupying authorities in violation of international law. In that regard, Iraq categorically rejects once again the step taken by the United States in relocating its Embassy to East Jerusalem. That action will not serve to further the cause of peace in the region and renders the situation even more complicated.\nIraq rejects unilateral blockades imposed outside the context of the United Nations system, and believes that economic sanctions are not a way to punish governing regimes or organizations under an acceptable or unacceptable pretext. It is the people who suffer the unjust consequences of such sanctions. The Iraqi people were victims of sanctions that lasted for nearly 13 years, from 1990 to 2003. Ordinary Iraqi people \u2014 men and woman, the elderly, the young and children \u2014 paid the heaviest price for those economic sanctions. We are not in favour of any blockade, because it is against the people.\nTurning to security, we believe that it is an indivisible whole. We cannot pursue security within our own borders while paying no heed to that of our neighbours. Security goes hand in hand with broader geopolitical concerns. When dealing with geosecurity, it is not enough to focus on one country\u2019s need. We must ensure that the needs of our neighbours are met as well.\nIraq welcomes the agreement on the situation in the Korean peninsula, which is in line with the purposes of the United Nations with regard to maintaining international peace and security.\nWe also hope that peace and stability will be restored in Syria, ending the spiral of violence there\n \nand preserving its territorial integrity, while supporting all political tracks that can lead to a balanced political solution acceptable to the Syrian Government and other Syrian parties. That would help to avoid more bloodshed and the death of innocent civilians. We therefore urge the political stakeholders to work seriously towards this type of political solution rather than a military one.\nTurning to Yemen, we believe that a solution to the crisis there can be found only through peaceful dialogue. The conflict must come to an end, the guns of war must be silenced and all external interference must cease.\nAs for Bashiqa, Iraq categorically rejects the presence of Turkish forces there and the continued violations of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty. We aspire to excellent and good-neighbourly relations with Turkey like those we have with other neighbouring countries. However, we call on Turkey to take a clear position with regard to those violations and to put an end to them.\nWe also call for an increase in Iraq\u2019s legitimate water resources. The loss of  those resources has led  to significantly reduced water levels in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, resulting in adverse environmental and economic effects with serious repercussions for the future. In the fourth millennium B.C. it was on the banks of those two rivers that the first civilization in human history emerged from the southern marshes, from Al-Amara and Al-Nasiriyya. We therefore feel responsible for preserving our rights and cultural heritage.\nIraq categorically rejects the statements by the Prime Minister of the Israeli entity claiming the presence of Iranian forces in Iraq as justification for an attack on our sovereignty. We reject any attempt to use the rostrum of the General Assembly to undermine the sovereignty and security of States.\nWe have worked recently to build close relations with all our neighbours and other friendly countries, moving away from polarization and international partisanship. We have sought to be a diplomatic bridge by establishing excellent relations and communications with all stakeholders in the region and worldwide so as to have a positive impact on the achievement of security in the region.\nIraq will remain a cradle of cultural, religious and ethnic diversity. As Sargon of Akkad said, Baghdad will remain the dome of the world, and whoever reigns over\nit will control the four winds of the world. Baghdad will never face death and destruction. It will withstand the crisis and its brutality. Baghdad is a creator of life. Our great poet Mustapha Jamal Al-Din addressed Baghdad by saying that it will continue to live. Baghdad will remain resplendent as the centuries pass. It will shine under the sun and the moon. Thanks to its resilience, it will withstand any adversity."

        "file_text": "I warmly congratulate  Ms. Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. Of the four women who have served  as  President over the years, she is the first from Latin America\n \nand the Caribbean. Jamaica is especially pleased that this honour has been conferred on such an eminent appointee from our region. We  also share her desire  to see a better gender balance in  the  presidency  of the General Assembly in the years ahead. She can be assured of Jamaica\u2019s full support during her tenure.\nThe chosen theme for this session resonates well with us. It is imperative that we make the United Nations relevant to all people through global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\nThis year it has been a decade since the global economic and financial crisis manifested itself in 2008. We are greatly encouraged by reports from international development partners that global growth has improved and unemployment has declined to its lowest since the crisis. We are, however, mindful that among developing economies, including small island developing States such as mine, growth prospects are becoming more uneven.\nWe remain vulnerable to a gamut of social, economic, environmental, financial and trade-related hazards, from within and beyond  our  borders.  In that context, Jamaica\u2019s quest to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth and meaningful job creation has encountered challenges. Ten  years  on, we still face the vagaries of an uncertain and at times volatile global economic environment. Together with persistent challenges linked to climate change and more frequent intense weather events, those problems all impact the pace of our development.\nNotwithstanding the multiple challenges that confront us individually or collectively, Jamaica is developing the social and political consensus it needs to pursue policies that will secure our economic independence. In the past decade, we  have  engaged in deep structural reform of our economy,  reduced our debt profile from its previous very high level, transformed our energy sector and increased our social support for the most vulnerable. What has been the result? Our sovereign ratings and outlook have moved from negative to positive.\nJamaica is not  sitting and waiting for  the world  to save it. As a small island developing State with numerous challenges, we are taking our destiny into our own hands. Ultimately, we believe that economic independence will secure our resilience. Nevertheless, we continue to strengthen traditional partnerships and\nbuild new ones with like-minded  countries  around the world that see the global benefits generated when countries big and small, rich and poor, work together to solve issues too big for any of us to solve alone.\nThis year, Jamaica was pleased to be invited to represent  the  Caribbean  Community  (CARICOM) at outreach sessions of the Group of Seven and the Summit of the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. We have also represented CARICOM throughout the year at meetings of the Group of 20 under the Argentine presidency. Those forums represent extremely influential groupings of countries. Jamaica believes that such groupings provide a unique opportunity, working alongside international development partners, to address the problems faced by weaker economies across the globe. Jamaica therefore welcomes the opportunity to share perspectives with our stronger economic partners to ensure that they gain an understanding of the risks that we face in our region of small developing States, most of which are island States.\nJamaica stands ready to continue working on how we can transform global thinking and together find effective solutions within a fair, rules-based multilateral system that is supportive of policies that seek to ensure the emergence and empowerment of small and developing States, truly leaving no country \u2014 and no one \u2014 behind.\nOur concerted action must embody effective strategies to bolster the global financial system through a robust global campaign to identify funding for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and resilience and adaptation measures to address the devastating effects of climate change and natural disasters. Jamaica and our CARICOM brothers and sisters do not have the luxury of engaging in a philosophical debate on whether or not climate change is real. The issue is existential for us. Major storms are no longer uncommon; they have given way to superstorms. They are stronger and more frequent. Every year, the Caribbean  region,  running right  up to the south-eastern coast of the United States of America, lives in fear for five months \u2014 five months of hoping that the devastation that was wreaked on North Carolina, Antigua and Barbuda, Texas and Grenada is not visited upon them this year.\nHave Member States seen what has happened to Dominica? The disaster wreaked by those superstorms\n \nis the closest thing that we  can imagine or  compare  to a nuclear event. After four hours of one hurricane, Dominica lost most of its gross domestic product (GDP). The people of that small island are still recovering today.\nAs the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (A/73/268) confirms, last year we witnessed the costliest North Atlantic hurricane season yet, with losses estimated at $229 billion. Furthermore, the economic cost of climate-related disasters globally was $320 billion.\nWith special reference to the issue of climate change, I was particularly honoured by the invitation from Secretary-General Guterres to join him and President Macron of France in leading a special initiative to mobilize funds committed at the Copenhagen Summit in 2009 to the amount of $100 billion per year until 2020. We are only two years away from the deadline but as of today we are nowhere near the target. We must therefore galvanize an effective mobilization campaign. Against that background, my delegation looks forward to the climate change summit to be convened by the Secretary-General in 2019. More specifically, I am also personally committed to working assiduously to strengthen momentum aimed at securing the promised resources to address climate-related issues, which affect all of us.\nMany of  the  structural   factors  that   impede our ability to narrow the persistent income gap between developing and advanced economies can be addressed through the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable  Development  and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Global estimates of the scale of the SDGs financing gap run on the order of from $5 trillion to $7 trillion per annum. Meaningful progress in that regard will require us to tap into various sources of funding. I cannot overstate the importance of including innovative ways of mobilizing private-sector financing.\nIn addition, several small island  developing  States like Jamaica are deemed to have graduated to middle-income status primarily by virtue of their GDP per capita. Many of them, however, are highly indebted and vulnerable. High debt ratios constrain our ability to secure domestic fiscal resources at a reasonable cost for the implementation of national development goals. The reality is that even though many have made progress\nin reducing levels of extreme poverty, several of our broader development efforts have stalled.\nWe therefore highly commend the work of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which has affirmed the importance of complementing the per-capita income criterion by addressing structural gaps that retard development prospects for  middle-income countries. Accordingly,  I am reiterating my call for international financial institutions to address that persistent problem known as the middle-income trap. We believe that a special initiative for highly indebted middle-income countries could provide the framework for the type of support that those countries require. It is our great hope that the United Nations high-level meeting on middle-income countries, scheduled for later this year, will give its fullest consideration to  those  matters  and  to  ways in which the United Nations system can  provide better support.\nIn the interim, Jamaica continues to work with partners like Canada to provide a platform where countries can engage directly with actors in the private sector, development finance institutions and regulators. Our goal is to forge collaborative partnerships between United Nations Member States and the private sector in order to determine practical, solution-oriented ways of securing new and long-term capital investment, utilizing a mix of public, private and blended financing to implement the SDGs.\nEven as we diligently seek financing for sustainable development, we are mindful that we live in a world where international peace and security are under continued threat. The world has witnessed several terrorist attacks and is grappling with a range of conflicts that appear intractable. The Secretary-General has therefore appropriately emphasized conflict prevention as well as promoting a new disarmament agenda. As he has often said, we must confront issues concerning peace and security along a peace continuum, from prevention, conflict resolution and peacekeeping to peacebuilding and sustainable long-term development.\nJamaica is especially interested in the efforts to build a secure environment by combating the illicit traffic and trade in small arms and light weapons. We have made significant national institutional changes, undertaken policy enhancements and adopted legislative amendments in the areas of security and justice in our own country. We now look forward to working with\n \nother Member States, the United Nations system and partners at all levels to ensure that the progress we have made is sustainable.\nSocieties function best when an inclusive global environment is created where no one feels left behind. The implementation of the SDGs must be people-centred. Embargoes and other financial and economic barriers must not become tools aimed at preventing people such as our neighbours the citizens of the Republic of Cuba from attaining their rightful development goals. Jamaica continues to call for a lifting of the embargoes on that country. We also believe that it is important to support the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoys in pursuing the political processes related to situations such as those in the Western Sahara, Syria and Myanmar.\nAs we prepare to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us continue to be mindful of the many among us who consistently face discrimination in various forms. Jamaica has been at the forefront of international human rights efforts, having been the first country to incorporate human rights into its foreign- policy strategy, a principle that we guard fiercely. We will never lose sight of the responsibility to promote and protect the interests of the vulnerable. We are especially keen to ensure that our women, children, persons living with disabilities, our elderly and young people can make meaningful contributions to a safe and prosperous society and reap its benefits. Jamaica will shortly become a member of the Economic and Social Council, which is currently presided over by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Our term of office will coincide with what promises to be a momentous year for that body. We are committed to advancing the work of the Council, including during its High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.\nSocieties are not sustainable without healthy citizens. As a region that has been severely affected  by non-communicable diseases, we in the Caribbean are actively promoting and implementing measures to reverse that trend by encouraging health and wellness. I felt truly energized as I joined my CARICOM colleagues this morning in launching Caribbean Moves, a region-wide initiative aimed at raising awareness and increasing physical activity among our young people, as well as those who are not so young. We look forward to building on the outcomes of the high-level meeting that has been convened this week on\nnon-communicable diseases. Jamaica will also support ongoing actions to combat tuberculosis and promote universal health coverage.\nThe President of the General Assembly has challenged us to ensure that the United Nations remains a beacon of hope for each citizen across the globe. To that end, the United Nations must be responsive to an ever-changing and unpredictable world if it is to remain relevant and effective. The Secretary-General is correct in stating in his report on the work of the Organization that\n\u201cone of the most valuable assets of the United Nations is its capacity to operate as a convener of people, a proponent of ideas, a catalyst for action and a driver of solutions.\u201d (A/73/1, para. 1)\nFor  that reason, we  remain steadfast in our support  of efforts to reform the United Nations. We commend the Secretary-General\u2019s actions in pressing for reform of the peace and security architecture and the United Nations development system and its management and operational structure. Of course, we are ever-mindful of the words of our recently departed former Secretary- General Kofi Annan, a stalwart of multilateral diplomacy, that no reform of the United Nations will be complete without reform of the Security Council.\nOur global alliance comprises 193 sovereign States, but there is no denying the fact that we are all interdependent. A joint and multifaceted response is required to surmount the myriad hurdles ahead of us, for it is only through collaboration that we can build our societies and secure our common future. Our legacy must be one that uplifts and inspires. Let that therefore be our mandate for the seventy-third session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by congratulating the President and her country of Ecuador on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly this year. Let me also thank the President\u2019s predecessor for steering the General Assembly at its seventy-second session with admirable skill. On behalf of my Government and the people of Somalia, our sympathies and condolences go to the Government and the people of Indonesia, who have suffered as a result of the recent deadly tsunami that has claimed hundreds of human lives.\nIt is a profound honour for me to address the General Assembly on behalf of the President of the Federal Republic of Somalia. Our Administration has now completed one and a half years in office, and I am\nglad to say that we have made huge strides in security- sector reform and in our political and economic transformation. We are, however, mindful of the enormous challenges that we face in fixing Somalia, and especially in overcoming the threats of terrorism.\nI am equally mindful of the huge  expectations that our people have for our President\u2019s leadership and his ability to provide lasting solutions to our security challenges. It is for that reason that our President, His Excellency Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmajo, recently spent six weeks at our defence headquarters and time at various defence positions, giving directions and providing on-the-ground approvals at forward operating bases.\nWe have initiated a new round of operations that have successfully opened up road networks and supply routes and thereby have liberated towns and villages from occupation by Al-Shabaab terrorists. We recognize that providing lasting solutions to the challenge of security is an immense undertaking that needs a multifaceted approach. While we and our partners are taking out and dismantling all the terrorists\u2019 hideouts by military means, we are also engaging our religious leaders, elders, young people, women and civil-society groups so that we can turn the tide against the twisted ideology of hate and religious intolerance.\nThe silver lining is that young men and women are not voluntarily joining Al-Shabaab. That ideology is no longer popular, and Al-Shabaab and Al-Qaida no longer have a ready stream of new and volunteer recruits in Somalia. It is also important to note that some within their ranks, mostly young men and women, have heeded our amnesty offer, renounced violence and peacefully surrendered. Senior commanders, former sector heads and infantrymen have  unconditionally  surrendered  as well, bringing with them their arsenals and their non-standard tactical vehicles, known in military terms as \u201ctechnicals\u201d. The combination of those factors has further weakened the terror network\u2019s logistical and planning capabilities.\nAl-Shabaab now largely exists as an amorphous network operating as an irregular outfit that plans terror attacks from the shadows, but not as a strong insurgent force that can sustain resistance. We are now engaged in creating civil networks aimed at encouraging a healthy partnership between law enforcement and communities that can flush out terrorist  remnants. Our people acknowledge that sustaining security is a\n \ncollective responsibility, and in turn that awareness has helped us establish effective policing models that involve the public.\nOur quest for a peaceful and stable Somalia will not end when Al-Shabaab is defeated, but that is the first step. Our comprehensive security-sector reform is our basis for developing capacity, streamlining, strategizing and implementing a practical transition that envisions an effective security force and stable security institutions.\nWe recognize that promoting justice, respecting the rule of law and protecting peoples\u2019 rights are key components in peace-building. That  quest  includes an organized, gradual and systematic transfer of security tasks to appropriate forces,  as  agreed  in  our national security architecture, while at the same time establishing political and economic measures to support and sustain the transition at the federal, state and community levels.\nOn behalf of the people of Somalia, I want to say unequivocally that we are truly grateful to the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). They have made huge sacrifices to keep our people safe, and that will never be forgotten. We remain in their debt.\nIn order to consolidate our collective security gains and further support our Somali security institutions  so that we can take over from AMISOM, I call on the United Nations to lift the long-standing arms embargo on Somalia, which is now preventing us from levelling the field in our battle with terrorist groups. When our fighting arsenal is only equal to the enemy\u2019s, the odds are split. A stronger fighting capacity would give us the upper hand and enable us to entirely dismantle the terrorists, and possibly in a shorter time.\nOur Administration\u2019s foremost objective is expanding the democratic space available to our people. It should be considered sacrosanct that every Somali should enjoy the inalienable rights to life, freedom and protection enshrined in our provisional Constitution, including freedom of the press, freedom of association and even the freedom to petition the Government for the redress of grievances. That is why we are winning the fight against terrorists. Our people have been suppressed and subjugated for a long time by terrorist networks, and those freedoms and protections mean a lot to them. Individually and collectively, our people\nand communities recognize that it is the responsibility of their Government to protect their liberties. Our people also appreciate the fact that for the Government to do so, we must all  operate  within  the  terms  of our Constitution.\nOne of our core values is protecting, supporting and providing a platform for minority groups and communities and those with special needs. Our people acknowledge that for our system of governance to be effective, the rule of law must reign supreme. Only then can we attain the vision of a prosperous Somalia. As we mark 18 years since the rebirth of our Republic in Arta, Djibouti, our quest for an inclusive, reformed political system is now on the right track. We have an agreed election model, adopted jointly by the central Government and the federal member states in Baidoa in June and endorsed by the international community in Brussels during the Somalia Partnership Forum in July. We  note that it  is the election period for  some  of the federal member states. Our role, as the central Government, will be to promote transparent, free and fair processes.\nWe have set specific goals with regard to economic development and have established  frameworks  for key deliverables in attaining our goals for sustainable productivity in the areas  of  agriculture,  fisheries  and livestock. Somalia enjoys the double blessing of    a strategic location in the Horn of Africa and a vast wealth of natural resources. Significant oil reserves, natural gas, iron ore and arable and productive land,  as well as Africa\u2019s second-longest coastline after the island of Madagascar, provide enormous opportunities for sustainable output.\nMy Government\u2019s objective is to tap into those opportunities, transform our economy, streamline our trade and investment policies, and open up new trade routes and horizons for our people. In that regard, we are seeking to strengthen alliances with our core partners so as to promote trade and investment opportunities, even as we widen our scope in our quest for broader, far-reaching economic cooperation. We seek to strengthen strategic partnerships with our neighbours, the continent and the world, where we share mutual interests in economic development, security  and social cooperation.\nOne of our Government\u2019s key priorities is promoting sustainable fiscal policies aimed at growing our economy and instilling the discipline required\n \nto maintain it. Somalia is committed to working purposefully for financial self-sufficiency and the achievement of the crucial Sustainable Development Goals. Through the International Monetary Fund\u2019s staff-monitored programme, we have raised domestic revenue to unprecedented levels, and we are in the process of normalizing relations with international financial institutions through continuing dialogue and meaningful engagement. Those efforts are edging us closer to debt relief.\nSomalia is committed to boosting economic integration and free trade flows across the region. The Horn of Africa is undergoing a remarkable political and economic transformation. Somalia is  proud  to  be playing a leading role in the quest for the region\u2019s economic integration and to be serving as a mediator in the effort to end the decades-long conflicts that have dogged the region. We are pleased to be contributing towards realizing the African Union\u2019s goal of silencing the guns by 2020.\nA new dawn of leadership is at  hand in the Horn of Africa. A stronger desire to bolster historical ties for shared interests represents a means for effective cooperation among the countries of the region. In order to achieve our common goal of economic  progress and prosperity for the Horn of Africa, I humbly call  on the United Nations to lift all economic sanctions on our neighbour, Eritrea. Such a move would improve the flow of imports and exports and the movement of people and businesses, and it would fulfil our vision for the successful economic integration of the region.\nThere is evidence everywhere that Africa is moving towards greater connectivity and prosperity. East Africa is becoming the continent\u2019s fastest-growing region as Africa becomes the world\u2019s largest  free trade area. It is time for us to focus on and encourage intra-African investment. Somalia, with its resource potential, is committed to moving with the continent. We have recently joined the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa trade bloc, and we have also applied for membership in a number of other trade and economic blocs.\nIt is only by expanding the prospects for open markets, free trade, investments and policies that ease the movement of people and businesses between the countries of Africa that we can bring about solutions to the domestic, economic and social challenges that we face, as we work towards realizing the African\nUnion\u2019s Agenda 2063. We need to formulate joint policies that provide lasting solutions to the problem of illegal immigration and that expand our scope and vision for economic and social progress, which in turn will help to create jobs and opportunities for our young people, provide meaningful employment and improve the quality of education. It can no longer be business as usual when, year in and year out, we are losing hundreds of productive young men and women to the Mediterranean, ostensibly in search of better living prospects. It is ironic that this is happening as the world is focusing on Africa for its resources, markets and labour.\nI am hopeful that better days and better prospects lie ahead for all of us. For Somalia, it is the beginning of a transformation. We have risen anew and afresh. We are not only optimistic but also motivated, as our security is improving, our economy is on an upward trend and our foreign policy has already received accolades in the region and beyond. We  are focused on keeping pace with the ever-changing economic and technological dynamics of today, and we are embracing new ideas. As such, we are open to all investments, and we are ready to do business.\n"

        "file_name": "YEM_73_2018.txt",
        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Yemen, I would like to congratulate Ms. Espinosa Garc\u00e9s and the friendly Republic of Ecuador on her assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session, and to wish her every success. I would also like to thank her predecessor for his notable efforts at the helm of the previous session. I thank the Secretary-General for his sincere and outstanding work, especially his attempts to advance peace in my country, Yemen, as well as his Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, whose ongoing efforts we support.\nThis is the fourth time I have addressed the Assembly from this rostrum since 2015. We are still  in the grip of a war imposed on our long-established Yemeni people by armed militias who are receiving financial, media, military and logistical support from Iran and Hizbullah. They are extremists. They employ gangster tactics such as blowing up houses and places of worship and planting mines with unprecedented recklessness. They forcibly recruit  children  and extort funds and remittances. They have taken away our freedoms and rights while wreaking havoc in our institutions. However, as I address the Assembly, the Government of Yemen and all our local authorities  and Government agencies are working hard from our provisional capital, Aden, and in our various liberated governorates to restore security and stability, as well as to provide services and create a democratic, federated civilian State where human rights are safeguarded, the dignity of women and youth is protected and the rights of children and various marginalized sectors of society are respected, a State where justice and equality prevail, in accordance with the outcome of our National Dialogue Conference and as a result of the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, its implementation mechanism and the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nIn past statements from this rostrum I have emphasized that Yemen\u2019s predicament is not a political conflict that can be contained in a dialogue. I have said that it is not even a coup, as those are conventionally defined and as happen in other States. It is a series of attempts to undermine the foundations of coexistence among Yemenis, to undermine their moderate beliefs\n \nand national principles as established by the two glorious revolutions of 26 September and 14 October. We are fighting a complex religious group that believes as a matter of policy in its divine and exclusive right to rule. It scorns all the contemporary values of democracy and human rights. Socially, it considers itself a unique race and demands that people glorify it. It is a group that has made use of every form of violence to tear down society and sow hatred among the people. Nationally, it is a group that has abandoned any loyalty to its nation and has become a war proxy that is beholden to Iran and Hizbullah. Any attempt to make peace with it is therefore doomed to fail, despite the major concessions we have made to establish peace in Yemen.\nWith that in mind, I call on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities by putting pressure on Iran to stop intervening in Yemen and supporting the Houthi militias, and to abide by international resolutions and participate in peace efforts. On multiple occasions from this rostrum I have told the Assembly that Iran conducts blatant interventions in Yemen. It finances the Houthi militias and provides them with weapons, missiles, equipment and experts. It targets international and regional waters and jeopardizes international shipping routes, and its policies enable the flow of drugs to other countries as well as drug-trafficking generally. It supports terrorism through the Houthis, Al-Qaida and Da\u2019esh.\nThe Yemeni Government has always reached out for peace through round after round of  consultations in Vienna, Geneva and Kuwait, and even after our Government delegation\u2019s return from Geneva at the beginning of this month. Our high-level delegation was keen to seize any opportunity that would alleviate the suffering of our people and achieve peace. However, the intransigence and brazenness of the insurgent Houthi militias have disappointed the hopes of the Yemeni people that any possible progress can be made, even at the humanitarian level. That is typical of this terrorist group.\nI would like to underscore once again from this rostrum that we are ready for peace. We do not advocate war and vengeance but rather peace and harmony. We are fully aware of our responsibilities to the patient Yemeni people. What we are seeking is sustainable peace based on national, regional and international terms of reference. We want to restore our State and put an end to the coup in every aspect. We uphold the principles that our State must have sovereignty over\nall of our national territory and that the State alone must possess medium and heavy weapons. That is the only way to attain stability in Yemen. Anything else will merely mean delaying and then preparing for new rounds of war and conflict.\nWe know that we cannot obtain peace by pleading with these gangsters, as some Member States do. Rather, peace can be achieved by diligently implementing the relevant international resolutions, and Member States should be serious about implementing them, especially Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), which calls on the Houthis to withdraw from cities and institutions and to hand over their weapons unconditionally. I therefore want to call on the Council not to waver in ensuring that its resolutions are implemented, as it did to ensure the political transition and national dialogue in Yemen, which endured for more than a year.\nI want to underline the Yemeni Government\u2019s commitment to its efforts to protect civilians, especially women and children. We do not target civilians or their schools, hospitals or residential areas where there are rebel strongholds. We have an independent national commission of inquiry into human rights violations that investigates all allegations of violations of any sort. Every military unit of the Yemeni army has also been instructed not only to refrain from recruiting children but also to protect them, rehabilitate those who have been detained when fighting with the rebels and ensure that they return to school.\nIt is well known that the war has left our country facing economic hardship. The militias have drained our country\u2019s resources and our internal and external reserves, which has had an enormous impact on our citizens. In an effort to deal with these issues and stop the situation from continuing to deteriorate, we have introduced a series of measures, most recently last month, when we created an economic commission that the Government has authorized to take all necessary measures to halt the devaluation of our currency and develop a comprehensive economic vision that can help us adapt to this unprecedented situation. The Government, the commission and the Central Bank of Yemen have taken numerous remedial measures and issued a number of immediate instructions aimed at optimizing the conditions for dealing with our economic difficulties. They include permitting  the  export  of oil and gas, stopping foreign currency flight, curbing imports of luxury goods and raising interest rates. In that regard, while Saudi deposits, though not the first\n \nattempts to stop the devaluation of our local currency, have helped to mitigate the economic crisis, Yemen is still more than ever in dire need of everyone\u2019s support.\nDespite Yemen\u2019s limited resources and current circumstances, we continue to participate genuinely and effectively in the fight against terrorism, which   is an unprecedented threat to international peace and security, as well as development. Within the framework of our national policy on fighting the scourge of terrorism, the Government will not cut back its efforts to take  measures  to counter  terrorism  financing and money laundering, and we are making earnest efforts to continue implementing our laws in that regard. My Government has imposed more stringent controls on various suspicious financial transactions and has strengthened coordination, cooperation and the exchange of information with all the relevant international and regional stakeholders. The Yemeni Government will also spare no effort to combat drugs and the illicit trade in them, whose proceeds are used to support and finance the terrorist acts committed by the Houthi militias, Al-Qaida and Da\u2019esh. I call on all States to cooperate and coordinate with us in combating the smuggling of artefacts for financing militias and terrorist groups.\nIt is a happy coincidence that today marks the great Yemeni people\u2019s celebration of the fifty-sixth anniversary of our immortal 26 September revolution, which declared Yemen a democratic republic more than half a century ago. We are proud to be able to retell  the glories of Yemen and the struggle of its liberal heroes. We want to stress to our people that the long history of the sacrifices that Yemenis initiated against underdevelopment, the rule of the clergy, injustice and tyranny is complemented today by the sacrifices of the heroes who are defending our revolution, our Republic and our country\u2019s unity. In the twenty-first century we can never accept the return of the rule of the mullahs in a new guise, that of the Houthi militias who want Yemen to revert to the dark ages of despotism.\nYemen is the origin and source of Arabism. It will continue to stand tall, proud and unified under a just, federated regime that corresponds to the ambitions and expectations of our great people. I am saddened  to see bloodshed anywhere in Yemen, but I feel responsible before God and the people for stopping that bloodshed, inflicted by the war that has been imposed on our people. We will continue to strive positively and patiently alongside the rest of the world and to make\nevery sacrifice in our quest to restore peace, security and stability. It is our duty to alleviate the suffering of our people throughout our beloved nation, which today is struggling to implement the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference, which are supported unanimously by Yemenis of all Yemeni parties, political and civilian organizations, including the Houthis themselves, and have been drafted as part of the Constitution for our new federated Yemen.\nIn that regard, on behalf of the Yemeni people I would like to thank the King, the  Government  and the people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has played a leading role in alleviating the humanitarian suffering in Yemen through its continued  support and its humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts, especially the Saudi reconstruction and development programme in Yemen, an outstanding project  aimed at bringing development to our troubled areas. Those efforts are starting to have positive effects for both the economy and for Yemeni citizens throughout the liberated territories. I would also like to sincerely thank the humanitarian organizations of the Arab coalition countries, as well as our sisterly and friendly donor countries, in addition to the various United Nations bodies, for their exceptional humanitarian efforts. I also want to take this opportunity to renew my call to all donors to honour the pledges they have made to the humanitarian response plan in Yemen with a view to further alleviating my people\u2019s suffering.\nThe suffering of the Palestinian  people  is growing daily, owing to  Israel\u2019s  occupation policies in the Palestinian territories. That is the  main cause  of tension in the Middle East. The Palestinian people have long awaited a just solution that will guarantee the creation of their independent State and an end to their suffering. In that regard, we call on the international community to continue supporting the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, in order to enable it to continue assisting Palestinian refugees.\nMy hope is to see the work of the General Assembly at this session succeed. I hope that by the next session, peace will have prevailed in Yemen and in the whole world.\nIn conclusion, I would like to salute from this rostrum all our great Yemeni people, who are struggling\n \neverywhere to create a new, federated Yemen, a Yemen of justice, equality and good governance. I congratulate all of them, everywhere, on the occasion of the fifty-sixth anniversary of the glorious revolution of 26 September and the fifty-fifth anniversary of the immortal revolution of 14 October. I also want to say to all honourable, liberal, striving Yemenis that upholding the objectives of the September and October revolutions requires the implementation of the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference and the creation of a new federated Yemen with all of its six regions. May the liberal martyrs of Yemen rest in peace. I also wish a speedy recovery to the Yemeni wounded and freedom to the abductees.\n"

We know all too well how challenging this time must be for them, and we off them our solidarity.\nThere are few moments in the history of a nation that capture the resilience, fortitude and  strength of its people. For us that moment came on 18 September 2017, when Hurricane Maria unleashed its fury of 180-mile-per-hour winds on us,  bringing  Dominica to its knees. Immediately after the raging winds and torrential downpours subsided, our people raised their battered and wounded selves and began the daunting task of search-and-rescue and clearing roadways, and thereafter quickly moved into rebuilding mode.\nI am proud to stand here, one year later, representing a people who have fought against adversity since that day to attain some form of normalcy in their lives. I am proud to be representing students who spent months\n \naway from classrooms and endured the inconvenience of no electricity, no Internet and the disruption of living in shelters, but who attained some of the  highest scores on the recently concluded Caribbean secondary-school examinations. I am proud to stand here representing the farmers who have gone back to their fields and are now harvesting fresh produce to feed our people and to export. I applaud Dominicans far and wide for being part of the relief efforts and the rebuilding process, but I salute in particular those at home who have walked for miles every day up, down and across the island to be of service, and worked countless hours to save lives, provide essential services and deliver vital supplies to those in need. Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc on Dominica, but the world must be told of the strength of Dominicans, our tenacity and our determination as a people.\nThe efforts of our people were keenly  matched  by the outpouring of support that we received from members of the United Nations family \u2014 from our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean region to our international partners and friends, ordinary men and women across the globe reached out to us to lend a helping hand. As we speak, scores of volunteers are  on the ground helping with the rebuilding efforts. We have also received tremendous support from regional response agencies and international organizations, both within and outside the United Nations system, and from institutions such as the World Bank. All of their efforts have contributed significantly to the progress that we have made thus far. We cannot on this occasion single out those many persons, countries and organizations that have reached out to us, but the people of Dominica are eternally grateful to all of them for standing with us in our darkest hour. I thank them all.\nA few days after the passage of Hurricane Maria, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit of Dominica stood before this body and sounded a call for action (see A/72/ PV.19). He called for the world to wake up and take note that the war of climate change had come to our shores. He sent out a call to all countries \u2014 big and small, developed and developing \u2014 to come together to save our planet. One year later, what have we done? Where are we? What have we achieved? Among and around us are many who continue to deny the reality of climate change. We have not, as a global community, agreed on a plan for the implementation of the commitments made at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange in Paris. Nor have we mobilized the resources to capitalize the $100 billion dollars per year pledged to assist the most vulnerable and to adapt to and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. While we have been failing to live up to those commitments, Arctic ice shelves have continued to melt at an alarming rate, the oceans continue to get warmer, hurricanes and storms continue to develop and threaten our countries, and droughts are becoming more severe and flooding more pronounced. Climate change is therefore the global responsibility of our time. I do not even for a brief moment say that lightly. How could I say anything lightly, standing here in this forum that appeals to our universal humanity?\nWe live in a world in which too many children go hungry night after night; light arms and small weapons continue to infiltrate our most vulnerable societies; and non-communicable diseases account for many preventable deaths. Yes, I agree that poverty, inequality and violence are shared responsibilities too, but their modern-day manifestations are wrapped up in climate change. Climate change arises from activities that support and reflect inequalities, and it is always the poor who suffer the most. It is the poor whose lands are impacted by severe droughts and flooding and whose homes are destroyed and whose loved ones perish. It  is the poor who have the least capacity to escape the heavy burdens of poverty, disease and death.\nMuch violence flows directly from the climate change-induced scarcity of things like water and productive lands. Climate change is the main symptom of our world\u2019s broken economy, society and humanity. Those are precisely the issues for which the United Nations was created. Let this not be just another moment to simply sharpen the rhetoric or to speak merely of redoubling current efforts. We have done that too many times before, and have nevertheless watched climate change continue its ravages. While we pontificate and engage in a perpetual debate, climate change will march on, laying waste  to  our  forests and fields, whipping up the fury of angry winds and punishing rains and wrecking lives and  livelihoods.  It is no secret that some countries\u2019 lack of motivation to take the necessary action is rooted in the economic truth that those who gain most from the activities that create climate change remain the most removed from its dire consequences. Since climate change is the result of an economic calculus that will keep pushing global destruction further and further along, it must be\n \naccepted as the responsibility of our time, one we must put our collective efforts behind to arrest.\nIt was only after Prime Minister Skeritt left this Hall last year that international experts completed the post-disaster needs assessment for Dominica. Their conclusions disclosed that a single hurricane had in a few hours caused loss and damage equivalent to 226 per cent of our country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). A mere two years earlier, a tropical storm had wiped out the equivalent of 90 per cent of our GDP. The cost of rebuilding a better and more resilient nation comes with a price tag far in excess of what small developing States like Dominica are able to meet single-handedly. That is exacerbated by the debilitating impact that those events have on economic activities. It  deprives the country  of much-needed revenue at a critical time. As I speak before the Assembly at this very moment, dangerous storms are gathering in the Western Atlantic. As climate change warms the oceans and feeds the rainstorms, the risk of future loss and damage increases. Yet the price of the production and consumption  of  goods that contribute to climate change has not been set to compensate us for our losses and damages resulting from that change.\nFrom the perspective of our shared destiny, those goods are being over-produced and over-consumed. Climate change is not a freak of nature. It is as man- made as power and greed. The \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle is an accepted principle \u2014 a golden nexus of morality, economics and environmental policy. The \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle is being tried and tested at the national level, but at the international level, alas, it is the victim who pays. Let us consider the insurance model championed by many industrialized countries and international agencies as the solution to climate change. Island States on the front line are being asked to take out additional insurance against the losses and damage that are the direct results of a change in climate caused by others. That is asking the victim to pay by instalment. The insane equivalent would be for the arsonist to tell a house-owner to take out fire insurance instead of trying to stop him setting fire to the house. If our principal response to man-made climate change is to make it easier for the victims to foot the bill, then the march of climate change will press on unimpeded. It is therefore untenable, indefensible and downright unacceptable.\nThe game-changer would be to establish a different kind of insurance that pays out quickly to the victims of climate disasters, especially for vulnerable and at-\nrisk countries like ours. Fairness requires that that insurance mechanism must be funded by those that have contributed most to climate change. Additionally, it needs to be scaled up as a matter of urgency. The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility paid out funds for the immediate relief efforts, but it does not have the capacity to insure against loss and damage. Today I want to propose that the United Nations oversee a climate loss-and-damage insurance fund, whereby premiums are paid by those who have contributed  most and continue to contribute to climate change,  and whereby payouts go quickly to those who suffer the direct consequences of climate disasters, once they have been independently declared as such.\nEnding the inequality that separates those who gain and those who lose would remove the fuel lines  of climate change. That is what the international community must do, if it is serious about halting climate change. We urge the Assembly to do that, and we hope its feet are swift because we can no longer afford to wait. Our people needed sanctuary and safety yesterday, not tomorrow. In the past 12 months, while contending with the sheer hard task of relief and early recovery efforts, housing the vulnerable and restoring essential services, Dominica has instituted a plan to make it the first climate-resilient nation in the world. We have drafted legislation to establish the Climate Resilience Execution Agency of Dominica, which will deliver the projects that will achieve that goal. We  have recruited its leadership and identified $1 billion worth of critical projects to complement the plan. We have rolled up our sleeves and started work. Our plan is based on designing extremely resilient networks, waterproofing our economy and building resilient communities. As we have critically examined the core of what it takes to be resilient, we have found  that what looked insurmountable from a distance is not so daunting up close.\nThat realization has buoyed our confidence and re-energized every Dominican. By the grace of God, therefore, and with the continued support of our partners in the global community, we will become the first climate-resilient nation in the world. We encourage other vulnerable small island States to embark on building resilience to climate change as well. The costs, however, are above  and  beyond  the  capacity of small States. Support is critical from international organizations and their member States with the requisite technical expertise and financial resources.\n \nThe role of the United Nations is therefore central in coordinating and mobilizing resources. The creation of a special international climate-change resilience facility to provide technical and financial resources should be given the most urgent attention possible. The existing global, economic and development architecture must facilitate that new development paradigm. Official development assistance must be re-engineered to take into account the vulnerability of small island States and the imperative of building resilience to climate change. The international financial institutions must rethink the classification of debt. They must also rethink the essential services and vital infrastructure.\nAs we battle the effects of  climate change,  we  are supremely conscious that there are many other challenges confronting our region and the wider world. Two emerging global problems brought on by climate change are those of climate-induced migration and disaster refugees. Although those problems are not yet full-blown, some countries that act as safe havens have begun to feel the pressures. That further underscores the fact that the emerging problems  brought  on  by the effects of climate change require urgent global attention. Dominica calls on the United Nations to begin the discourse on both climate migration and disaster refugees while it is still early.\nWe champion our region as a zone of peace. We remain extremely concerned about the situation in our sister countries of Venezuela and Nicaragua. We call for support for a process of dialogue in order to achieve a peaceful resolution that can benefit of  the  citizens of those nations, while respecting and observing the time-honoured international norms of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations.\nOver many years, this body has debated resolutions on ending the economic and financial blockade of our sister country Cuba. We have long established the fact that maintaining that trade embargo can have only a negative impact on our brothers and sisters in Cuba. Notwithstanding the constraints it faces, the Republic of Cuba has come to the aid of so many around the world, particularly in the areas of health care and education, and sometimes in the most trying of circumstances. We once again add our voice to the chorus of voices calling for an end to that blockade.\nDominica supports a United Nations  where young people, who account for more than 40 per\ncent of the world\u2019s population, can pursue a global youth agenda with opportunities for dialogue on key issues that affect their development. Similarly, we congratulate the stakeholder groups of persons with disabilities and other non-State actors for their efforts to advance opportunities for persons with disabilities in order to ensure that they remain part of the United Nations agenda.\nIf we keep looking down at our feet, we will die  of sorrow. We choose to look up. We move forward, knowing that we are not alone on this challenging journey. Only 12 months ago, the international community heard our cry and stood with us. That has made us stronger and more motivated. To those who came to our aid, we thank them and urge them to stay the course over the next few years. Let us set the example of a better future for all humankind. Let history record what we did, not what we said, and the efforts we made to end the march of climate change globally and reduce our vulnerabilities locally. We must grasp this moment together.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria, I congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her well-deserved election as President  of  the  General  Assembly  at  its seventy-third session. As she embarks upon her assignment, I would like to assure her of Nigeria\u2019s support in no less measure than that which we extended to her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k. We appreciate his effective leadership of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, his dedication, commitment and the fairness with which he treated all Member States. I also salute our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who has steered the affairs of the Secretariat with a focused commitment to the collective United Nations pursuits of global peace and security, equity and justice, inclusiveness, women\u2019s empowerment and human rights.\nIt is appropriate at this point to remember with deep sadness our late  seventh  Secretary-General,  Mr. Kofi Annan, who passed away on the eve of his eighty-second birthday. Kofi Annan\u2019s significant contributions to the work of the Organization have been acknowledged in the well-deserved tributes that poured in from around the world following his death. We in Africa, while mourning the loss of this great son of ours and citizen of the world, take pride in the way he served humankind in a truly exemplary  manner. He demonstrated in his calm but determined manner the virtues of compassion, dedication to the cause of justice, fairness and human rights. He was a visionary leader who inspired hope, even in the face of the most daunting challenges. He devoted his entire life\u2019s career to the United Nations and the pursuit of its ideals and goals. The world is indeed a better place thanks to his exemplary service.\nDuring the past year, the world saw some positive results and encouraging signs from the bilateral and multilateral efforts of  the  international  community in addressing conflicts, crises and threats to world peace. We particularly commend the efforts of the\n \nleaders of the United States, North Korea and South Korea in making headway towards our shared goal of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. In that connection, we acknowledge the commitment to peace shown by President Donald Trump and Chairman  Kim  Jong  Un by initiating a historic summit. We urge them to continue that positive engagement.\nRegrettably, many of the crises and threats to peace and security around the world, on which we debated last year and several previous years, remain unresolved. In some cases, matters have deteriorated. The continuing plight of the Rohingyas in Myanmar, the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the wars in Yemen and Syria and the fight against international and local terrorism, such as Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, come to mind. The terrorist insurgencies that we face, particularly in the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin, are partly fuelled by local factors and dynamics, but now increasingly by the international jihadi movement, runaway fighters from Iraq and Syria and arms from the disintegration of Libya.\nFortunately, the carnage appears to have somewhat abated in Myanmar. We commend the United Nations for staying focused on the situation of the Rohingya people in order to bring their suffering to an end and hold to account the perpetrators of the atrocious crimes committed against innocent and vulnerable members of that community, including women, children  and the elderly. The international community should strengthen its resolve to combat ethnic and religious cleansing everywhere. We support the United Nations efforts in ensuring that the Rohingya refugees are allowed to return to their homes in Myanmar with security, protection and a guarantee of citizenship. We note the indication by the  Government of  Myanmar of its willingness to address those issues, and we encourage it to do so expeditiously. In that context, Nigeria commends the Government and the people of Bangladesh in particular, and all other countries and organizations that have contributed to shouldering the burden of providing shelter and other vital assistance to the Rohingya refugees.\nThe carnage and the worsening humanitarian situations in Syria and Yemen continue unabated. But the international community cannot afford to give up on the Syrian and Yemeni peoples. We must pursue all efforts to find peaceful negotiated political solutions to those wars, which cannot be won by the force of arms alone. Regarding Syria, we hope that the United\nNations-sponsored Geneva process and the Sochi initiative, led by Russia, Iran, and Turkey, can advance that objective. The international community must keep up the pressure to encourage the parties to pursue the path of dialogue, negotiations and inclusiveness in resolving their sectarian divides and bringing to an end the  immense human suffering in Syria, as  well  as in Yemen. We commend Turkey, Jordan, Greece, Germany, Italy and France for hosting the millions of the refugees fleeing those brutal conflicts.\nThe situation in the Middle East, as grave as  it has always been, is now worsened by developments since we last met (see A/72/PV.3).  Nigeria continues to call on the Israelis and the  Palestinians to  make  the necessary compromises in the interests of justice, peace and security, in line with numerous United Nations resolutions and applicable international law. Unilateral, arbitrary and insensitive actions only prolong the conflict and undermine world peace and security. The deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza is an appalling result of the unrestrained use of power. We urge both parties to re-engage in dialogue on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid principles, the Quartet road map and the Arab Peace Initiative, among others. Nigeria reaffirms its unwavering support for a just two-State solution, negotiated without intimidation and with Israel and Palestine existing side-by-side in peace and security. The crises in the Middle East have deep roots and have remained unresolved for too long. Yet we should not fall into self-defeating despair and conclude that they are not amenable to solution.\nWe should draw inspiration from the remarkable leadership that motivated Ethiopia and Eritrea to restore long-lost hope for peace between them, a remarkable show of statesmanship that has now galvanized neighbouring countries, including Djibouti and Somalia, to push for peace in the subregion. I believe that with hard work, commitment and a disposition to compromise and make the necessary sacrifices, peace is achievable in the Middle East as well. Most crises usually have a variety of festering causes and effects. It is the failure to address them early and effectively that lead to out-of-control conflicts. Addressing them includes national and international collective actions that have a positive impact on peoples and communities. Therefore, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, which\n \nis the theme for this year\u2019s General Assembly, is very apt indeed.\nA topical consequence of the current conflicts around the world is the irregular migration of affected people from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa to Europe. Irregular migration entails huge avoidable loss of human lives, puts strains on services in host countries and communities and fuels anti-immigrant and racist sentiments in Europe. That is why we welcome the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the first-ever global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. We look forward to its adoption in Marrakech later this year. The aim is to protect the rights of migrants worldwide while addressing the concerns of countries of origin, transit and destination alike. Migration is a  constant  in  human affairs. We in Africa are grateful to countries that treat migrants with compassion and humanity, notably Germany, Italy and France. Irregular migration is not a consequence of conflicts alone, but of the effects of climate change and the lack of opportunities at home. Climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Very close to us at home, it is our lot in Nigeria, together with our neighbours around the Lake Chad basin, to live with the climate change consequences of a drastically shrunken Lake Chad and the parching up of otherwise fertile arable lands.\nLake Chad was a major source of livelihood for the more than 45 million inhabitants of the region. Its shrinking has meant the loss of such livelihoods, and the region\u2019s inhabitants have been impoverished and made vulnerable to the activities of extremists and terrorist groups. The instability caused in the subregion has intensified internal displacements, leading, among other consequences, to intense economic competition, especially between farmers and herdsmen. That is  why we continue to call for dedicated international engagement to accelerate recovery efforts in the Lake Chad basin to address the root causes of the conflicts in the region. What is required is continuous and robust United Nations cooperation with national Governments and subregional and regional organizations, such as the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, to enhance capacity in conflict prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding.\nWith regard to the Lake Chad basin plight, I extend our heartfelt appreciation to the United Nations, the Governments of Germany, Norway, the United States,\nSweden, the United Kingdom and France and a host of other development partners for their laudable support in assisting us in addressing both the humanitarian challenges and the  ongoing  stabilization  drive  in  the region.\nCorruption within countries and the illicit flow of funds across national boundaries have a huge negative impact on the stability, peace and economic prospects of millions in developing countries. Corruption significantly deprives national Governments of resources to provide meaningful livelihoods for their populations, who are predominantly young people, thereby giving rise to more irregular migration. The fight against corruption therefore involves us  all.  It  is in our collective interest to cooperate in tracking illicit financial flows, investigate and prosecute corrupt individuals and entities and repatriate such funds to their countries of origin. Fighting corruption and resolving international conflicts, crises  and wars; defeating terrorism and piracy; curbing arms trafficking and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which fuel such conflicts, in particular in Africa; stemming irregular migration by addressing its root causes; and the many other global challenges we are faced with today can be effectively addressed only through multilateral cooperation and concerted action.\nThe only global institutional framework we have to address those challenges is the United Nations system. That is why we continue to call for the strengthening of the Organization to make it more effective by speeding up the pace of progress towards its reform, including that of its principal organ, the Security Council. The reconstitution of the Council to make it more equitable and more representative of our global community is both a political and moral imperative. We believe that a reformed Security Council, with expanded membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, is in accord with prevailing international consensus and it is in our collective interest to do so. It is high time we stop skirting around the issue and establish achievable benchmarks and time frames for such reforms.\nI  assure  all   members  that  in  such   advocacy   I am only reflecting Nigeria\u2019s deep and abiding commitment to our Organization and its founding principles and goals. From the day we joined in 1960, we have contributed our quota to the fulfilment of the mandate of the United Nations. We have been active participants in many Security Council- and African Union-authorized peacekeeping operations around\n \nthe world, beginning with the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1960. Furthermore, Nigeria has always mobilized the required human and material resources to achieve certain United Nations goals,  including  the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are resolute in complementing the efforts and examples of the United Nations to promote gender equality and youth empowerment as necessary pillars for sustainable development.\nWithout such efforts there can be neither enduring peace nor security. As we craft and implement our national policies to achieve the goals set, we, in the spirit of international solidarity, will readily cooperate with other nations seeking to achieve  similar goals for their own populations to help ensure that no one is left behind.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His  Excellency  Mr.  Macky  Sall,  the  President  of the Republic of Senegal, and his Government, I would like to express my warm congratulations to the President on her election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. Beyond Member States\u2019 judicious choice  of  her and her country, Ecuador, it  is all women of the world who are honoured. I would like to convey Senegal\u2019s sustained tribute to them for their invaluable contributions and tireless fight for the well-being of humankind. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the work of her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k.\nI wish Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres every success in the reforms he is undertaking to give our Organization the means to better meet the new demands for momentum and efficiency of our times. I believe it is that ongoing concern to reform the United Nations and devote more tools and resources to it in order to respond to the legitimate expectations and aspirations of peoples that represents the interests and the high impact of the theme of this session, entitled \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d.\nThat current and relevant theme gives us an opportunity to assess our collective action in the light of the noble ideals of peace, security, stability, respect for human rights and sustainable prosperity, nourished by the founding fathers of the United Nations, in order to better understand the various challenges of our times in a troubled world undergoing profound change. These global challenges, including terrorism, extremist, xenophobic and racist abuses, poverty, migration, global warming and market regulation, require  that we find comprehensive and inclusive solutions to them through multilateralism.\nBy its very nature, the United Nations is the seat and embodiment of that multilateralism. It  remains the only forum where concerted solutions of universal scope can be conceived and developed. In addition, out of  fidelity to the historic and current calling of  the United Nations, it is more than ever incumbent on us to deepen our anchor in multilateralism in order to irreversibly establish the ideal of a better world where human beings remain at the heart of our concerns.\nThe world today is marked by growing pessimism about the effectiveness of the United Nations, which is sometimes rightly or wrongly accused of abandoning its task and being unable to provide adequate responses to our peoples\u2019 problems and the acute crises that seriously threaten our planet and life on earth. In that context, it is up to us to prove, if it is still necessary to do  so,  that the United Nations remains an essential platform in the conduct of world affairs. Its failure is everyone\u2019s failure, but its success is also everyone\u2019s success.\n \nTo improve the effectiveness of the Organization, we must overcome our ideological and political differences with a view to building a stronger United Nations, which will guarantee the effectiveness of multilateralism and among other things enable it to promote human rights, sustainable development and the advent of a world free of fear and poverty, an ideal that remains humankind\u2019s highest aspiration. The achievement of sustainable development in its triple dimensions \u2014 economic, social and environmental \u2014 should also guide our collective actions. That shared goal should continue to drive us forward, so that we can honour the commitments we made in September 2015 to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nIt is equally important to conclude the Doha Round of negotiations and agree on fair, democratic and sustainable trade rules, taking into account the interests of developing countries, particularly in Africa. Mutually beneficial trade that protects investment, pays a fair price for raw materials and generates shared prosperity is more important than ever. We also need an instrument to stop the tax evasion and illicit financial flows that undermine the African continent\u2019s development efforts.\nFurthermore, we must come to an agreement on issues related to climate change. In this regard, I would like to reiterate my country\u2019s support for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to which it remains committed, as well as to the fight against desertification and coastal erosion, in particular. As an African and coastal country that is particularly vulnerable to climate change, Senegal reiterates its call for increasing the endowment of the Green Climate Fund, with a view to giving States such as ours, which contribute less pollution and are more exposed to climate change, the opportunity to undertake appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures. Similarly, it  would  be  to the public good to agree on environmental issues and work to strengthen the international legal framework in that area through the adoption of a global pact for the environment. The same spirit of consensus should also prevail in such matters as financing for development, disarmament and the fight against terrorism.\nTo make the Organization more fit for purpose, we must complete the reform processes under way so that it can adapt to the new global political configurations and challenges of this world, which is totally different from the one into which the United Nations was born. That is why in particular we should show greater\npolitical will on finally agreeing on Security Council reform by correcting the historical injustice suffered by Africa, which remains the only continent without a permanent seat on the Council.\nWith that same determination, we should also work harder to realize the right of the Palestinian people to a viable State with East Jerusalem as its capital, coexisting in peace with the State of Israel, within secure and internationally recognized and guaranteed borders.\nFurthermore,  we  believe  that  the   adoption   of a global compact on migration that addresses the opportunities and challenges in that area is crucial and would be beneficial for a migratory population that is estimated at 3 per cent of the world\u2019s population, or more than 200 million people. In short, United Nations action should be reoriented and its power strengthened on a global scale, or we will never be able to achieve the ideals of peace, prosperity, social justice and friendship among peoples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nFor a United Nations that is close to the people and that serves our nations, we must successfully meet the challenge of providing sustainable development.  In that regard, I want to echo the appeal made by the international community when it met in February in Dakar for the Global Partnership for Education. Senegal hopes that the pledges made on that occasion to mobilize\n$3.1 billion for the strategic sector of education will  be honoured so that we can lift thousands of children, especially girls, out of the darkness of ignorance and into the light of knowledge.\nMy country accords great priority to improving the situation of women and young people. That is why we are implementing bold social programmes within the framework of our plan for an emerging Senegal by 2035, so as to ensure their empowerment and responsibility.\nMy country also remains committed to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 6, on water. In that regard, I would like to remind the Assembly that in 2021 Senegal will host the ninth World Water Forum. Senegal has also been chosen to lead UNESCO\u2019s International Hydrological Programme and to chair the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River, which remains a model worldwide and is recognized as an excellent example of peaceful cross-border water management.\n \nSenegal was honoured by President Macky Sall\u2019s appointment to be a prominent member of the High- level Panel on Water, which was  set  up  jointly  by  the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the World Bank and whose theme will be \u201cWater, Peace, Security\u201d. That theme  was  included on the agenda of the Security Council for the first  time during Senegal\u2019s presidency of the Council in November 2016.I would therefore like to reiterate our gratitude for the confidence that has been placed in Senegal within those frameworks, and to solicit the support of all for the success of the ninth World Water Forum. I am also pleased to note that Dakar will host the third iteration of the International Conference on the Emergence of Africa, on 17 and 18  January 2019. It will be a great opportunity to outline innovative economic and social development programmes.\nIt is also an appropriate time to commend the successful partnership model between Senegal and the United Nations Development Programme, especially in the implementation of the emergency community development programme, launched by President Macky Sall, which, in accordance with the principle of leaving no one behind, will make it possible to transform our rural populations\u2019 living conditions. Senegal is willing to share its experience in that area.\nI would like to inform members of Senegal\u2019s wish to run for the presidency of the Human Rights Council in 2019. We have already obtained the endorsement of the African Union and are counting on the valuable support of those here to help our candidacy for that important post. I am also pleased to invite members to the fifth iteration of the Dakar International Forum on Peace and Security in Africa, to be held on 5 and 6 November on the theme of \u201cPeace and security in Africa: the challenges of sustainable stability and development\u201d. I would like to ask everyone to participate in order to make that major event a success.\nIn conclusion, let us remember that at its founding, the United Nations symbolized humankind\u2019s most fervent hopes. Today it embodies them more than ever. It remains the only global institution whose legitimacy and competence derive from its universal composition and its mandate covering the three fundamental pillars of international peace and security, development and human rights. To take the full measure of our historical responsibilities and the hopes placed in the United Nations is therefore to make it an Organization at the\nexclusive service of Member States, their populations and humankind in all its diversity.\nI would therefore like to share the heartfelt cry of the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan \u2014 peace be with him \u2014 to whom I want to pay a sincere tribute. He said,\n\u201cBut let us not forget why the United Nations matters. It matters only to the extent that it can make a useful contribution to solving the problems and accomplishing the tasks I have just outlined ... If we lose sight of that point, the United Nations will have little or no role to play in the twenty-first century.\u201d (A/54/PV.94, pp. 3-4)\nI therefore urge the international community to continue its efforts to ensure the effective realization of our shared ideal of a better world for all, so that that terrible but lucid warning of the possible uselessness of our Organization does not become a cruel and destructive reality, frustrating humankind\u2019s most beautiful hope.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to take the floor today before the General Assembly, as the spokesperson for the will of the Government and the people, to confirm our commitment alongside, and in favour of, the United Nations. The international community needs a truly effective multilateralism and a United Nations that is strengthened in its role as a pillar of an international system based on peace, justice and equity. We therefore continue to support the reform plan of the Secretary-General, now more so than ever in the delicate implementation process that awaits him. We want a United Nations that is closer to the people, that is able to respond to their security and well-being needs and that is ready to protect them from the pitfalls of globalization, which offers many opportunities but can also produce errant effects.\nThe Italian Government has made those same priorities the basis of its action. Government action that does not give due consideration to ensuring that all of its citizens have equitable and fully dignified living conditions is not action that I can consider morally, much less politically, acceptable. When some accuse us of souverainism or populism, I always enjoy pointing out that article 1 of the Italian Constitution cites sovereignty and the people. It is precisely through that provision that I interpret the concept of sovereignty and the exercise of sovereignty by the people. That approach does not modify the traditional position of Italy within the international community and, consequently, towards the United Nations. Security, the defence of peace and the values that best preserve it, as well as the promotion of development and human rights, are goals that we share and shall continue to pursue with courage and conviction at the national and international levels.\nOn the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Italy expresses  that will through its candidature to the Human Rights Council. Respect for the inviolable rights of humankind is one of the pillars on which the Italian Republic is founded \u2014 our beacon, especially today, when we are called upon to address the immense challenges of the grave and prolonged crises in the Euro-Mediterranean area, including migratory flows. For years, Italy has been engaged in search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea and has saved tens of  thousands  of people from death, often single-handedly, as has frequently been acknowledged by those who say that Italy has saved the honour of Europe.\n \nThe migratory phenomena we are facing require short-, medium-, and long-term responses from the entire international community that are structured  and multi-level. It is on that basis that we support the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. This is a challenge that can, and must, be met through an approach of shared responsibility, in a logic of partnership between the countries of origin, transit and destination of the flows, while taking into account the priority need to guarantee the dignity of the individual, but also the firm determination to fight those who trample on that dignity and on life itself through human trafficking.\nItaly pursues the goals of international peace and security including during times of budgetary constraints. We are solidly  in  eighth  position  as  a  contributor to the regular budget of the United Nations, and we supplement that commitment through development initiatives, both at the bilateral level and through United Nations agencies. Those initiatives are inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals inscribed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Poverty, inequality, unemployment and the devastating effects of climate change are ills that concern every country, independently of their level of development.\nThe logic of assistance must give way to a framework of mutual responsibility and partnership, as promoted by Italy \u2014 for example, on the African continent \u2014 so that each stakeholder can do their part to the best of their possibilities and abilities.\nItaly is proud to be one of  the main contributors  to peacekeeping operations, a commitment we have maintained for many years and for which we have received the appreciation, essential to us, that comes first and foremost from the local communities in which we are operating.\nItaly is a country whose very DNA contains the promotion of dialogue and inclusiveness in crisis situations. Those principles are essential when addressing the grave and widespread situations of instability that today characterize an area that is vital to the security and prosperity of Italy and Europe as a whole, namely, the greater Mediterranean.\nIn the upcoming weeks Italy will host a conference on  Libya, the main goal of  which will be to support   a shared political path and contribute to the country\u2019s political stabilization. That path will foster the broadest possible involvement of Libyan stakeholders, who\nremain the masters of their destiny. The United Nations will play a central role through the action plan, on which all the contributions of the main international and regional stakeholders will converge.\nThe long conflict that has roiled Syria for seven years demonstrates all the limits of military solutions. We have the duty to support the action of the United Nations and of Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Staffan De Mistura.\nShared responsibility\u2014in the framework of building peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies \u2014 is a call that we share and accept as an invitation to change. The same spirit of change characterizes the action of the Government that I lead. But we must also assume that responsibility towards the reform of the Security Council, in which Italy will continue to pursue its deep commitment, in dialogue with all Member States, to achieve the goal of a shared reform.\nWe should all aspire to the path to effective multilateralism. Nevertheless, that path cannot\n \ndisregard the need for every member of the human family to recognize in the United Nations true global leadership, to which they look with renewed faith.\n"

        "file_text": "The General Assembly is holding its seventy-third session at a special moment as we pay tribute to two towering\n \nfigures of world politics, both sons of Africa: Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan.\nToday, exactly one year since my inauguration as President of the Republic of Angola, I have the honour, on behalf of the Angolan people, to  address  from  this rostrum for the first time the entire international community, represented here by its highest dignitaries. I salute the Heads of State and Government present here, as well as the leaders of the various international organizations and bodies, whom I believe to be working directly for the future of our planet.\nI take this opportunity  to thank the entire international community for its  support  for  peace and reconciliation in my country, Angola. I also offer my particular gratitude to the United Nations for the decisive role it played in  establishing  lasting  peace in Angola through two peace missions \u2014 the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola \u2014 and for the important work of its specialized agencies, funds and programmes, in particular UNICEF and the World Food Programme.\nWe also believe that Angola\u2019s experience in building peace and pursuing reconciliation between parties in conflict has served as a positive example for the United Nations, providing useful insights for approaching peace processes in other parts of the world. Angola has unique experience in building and maintaining lasting peace, continuously deepening national reconciliation, social inclusion and mutual forgiveness, and healing the wounds of the armed conflict, which ended almost 16 years ago.\nWe gather in the General Assembly  to  discuss and resolve the most serious problems and conflicts that threaten the very survival of humankind. I am referring to the hunger and poverty that affect millions of citizens around the world, global warming and its consequences, mass migration and especially illegal migration, trafficking in drugs, in human organs, and in children and women for forced prostitution, religious intolerance and extremism, terrorism, inter-ethnic armed conflicts, war among nations or even the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nEstablished 73 years ago with the declared purpose of restoring universal peace and harmony,\nconferring equal rights on nations large and small,  and establishing a world  of  cooperation,  progress and well-being, the United Nations is still far from achieving the goals enshrined in its Charter. While it is true that, immediately following that establishment, the immediate polarization of the planet into two antagonistic political and economic systems hindered the operationalization of principles favouring international peace and security, it would be unfair to deny that the United Nations has played a commendable role in ending colonialism, promoting human rights, supporting international development and cooperation, and managing and containing flashpoints of tension around the world.\nDespite the progress made to date, we must acknowledge the long-standing conflicts yet to be settled, such as that between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East, which can be resolved only through a solution based on two States living peacefully side by side, as advocated by the United Nations and the overwhelming majority of its Member States.\nWe welcome the recent efforts of the United States of America, North Korea and South Korea, with the contribution of the People\u2019s Republic of China, towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which has considerably reduced tensions that threatened to trigger a nuclear conflict that would endanger not only the region but international security in general.\nWith the end of the so-called Cold War, symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the momentous emergence of a new political paradigm oriented towards multilateralism, the United Nations eagerly resumed its work towards building a peaceful world order. We believe that, by working diligently together, we can achieve this goal.\nToday, in a time of ascendant globalization, there is no justification for the continued proliferation of apparently unresolvable conflicts of varying scale in several parts of the world, or for entire populations to continue suffering their tragic consequences, virtually abandoned to their fate. It is against  this backdrop that many voices are demanding profound reform of the United Nations so that it can better reflect today\u2019s world, where the emergence of new centres of economic and financial power and technological and scientific advances fully justify changes to the Organization\u2019s structures and intervention mechanisms, as well  as the enlargement and reform of the Security Council\n \nto better represent the various geopolitical regions of our planet.\nThe  political  configuration  of   today\u2019s   world, in which local, regional and intra-State conflicts represent the principal focus of international tensions and threats to peace, requires the United Nations to play an increasingly active role in promoting and assisting  political, social  and  economic  processes of democratization. This is the best way to resolve conflicts,  be  they  domestic, international,   ethnic or religious, which in most cases arise as a result of policies of authoritarianism or exclusion, intolerance, radicalism or interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. International terrorism, transnational organized crime, illegal immigration, xenophobia, trafficking in people and in drugs, and other scourges have today reached new proportions, affecting the quality of life of the inhabitants of the planet and calling for coordination at the highest level among all States Members of our Organization.\nThe seventy-third session of the General Assembly is being held under the theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. The United Nations should therefore attach priority to promoting and upholding human rights and strive to solve humankind\u2019s global problems \u2014 such as those relating to security, the environment, reducing inequality between the rich and the poor, and development \u2014 with a view to safeguarding world peace. We advocate the decentralization of the global financial system, based both on the promotion of trade and regional economic integration systems, and the enhancement of regional financial institutions on terms that allow for more sustainable economic development.\nThroughout our history as an independent country, our cooperation with the United Nations has always been a constant; it has helped us not only to relaunch our economy, but also to engage in seeking to build peace, democracy and development in southern and central Africa. The Republic of Angola stands ready to continue supporting all efforts to promote cooperation among all nations of the world in building peace and strengthening cooperation, trade and investment relations at the bilateral and multilateral levels.\n"

        "file_text": "I begin by sharing peace and blessings among us all and conveying warm Pacific greetings from the Government and the people of Kiribati. In the name of Almighty God, Kam na bane ni Mauri \u2014 May all be blessed.\nI join other leaders in congratulating the President of the General Assembly, and the Government of Ecuador, on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I wish her every success as she discharges her functions by making the United Nations family relevant to all  Members. By  the same token, I would also like to acknowledge the outgoing President, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, and the Slovak Republic for the very engaging and outcome-oriented leadership of the seventy-second session. I also thank the Secretary-General for his excellent leadership, in particular with regard to the current reform to make the United Nations fit for purpose and more adaptable for the present and future.\nWe commend the President of the General Assembly for the theme that she has chosen for the seventy-third session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. That is a strong call on and reminder to all leaders and the United Nations machinery that the  effectiveness of our efforts is measured not by how much we have achieved, but by how much we have changed the lives of those whom we serve for the better. Clearly, it was the primary intent of the founders that this should be the United Nations as they envisioned it. It is about servant leadership, whereby leadership is not only about serving but, more important, about protecting the lives of the powerless \u2014 those without a voice, those taken advantage of by the more powerful in society, and those who cannot help themselves politically.\nWe are reminded time and again that those people\u2019s lives are precious in the sight of God. In her captivating and simple words, Mother Theresa reflected powerfully on the life of a servant leader when she said, \u201cA life not lived for others is not a life\u201d. As leaders, it is our shared responsibility to ensure that we see to that. The theme also provides a timely call for a renewal of friendship, solidarity, cooperation and partnership between and among the peoples and nations of the world, thereby allowing greater commitment on all our part to make a difference for the well-being of all.\n \nKiribati has long recognized the prime importance of peaceful living, characterized by our own traditional, humble way of living in harmony with one another and our environment. Those are sustained through regular community meetings in traditional local meeting houses, called maneaba, to discuss important issues concerning the village and to address issues  under  the wise and experienced guidance of our elders. Decisions are made to promote mutual understanding, respect and cooperation among members of the entire society. Maneaba means \u201cto embrace all\u201d \u2014 a holistic system in which leadership and shared responsibility are undertaken for the benefit of the whole society. Accordingly, the maneaba system maintains its fundamentality as central and relevant to the people.\nIn the Pacific context, other relevant instruments have been adopted to address social, economic and political risks and security. Some  have  worked, while others have not, but that does not stop us from maintaining our resolve, through our own Pacific way, to undertake meaningful dialogue in which agreement through consensus serves as a prevalent norm. Moreover, the Pacific accounts for 20 per cent of the world\u2019s oceans in terms of our exclusive economic zone, and therefore the completion of maritime boundaries is very critical to providing certainty about the ownership of our ocean space in the face of climate change.\nA united world free from the threats of wars and violence, rooted in our greed to dominate others, is the kind of world that we want for all of us and for our children\u2019s generation. Our ultimate aim is to ensure that everyone can lead a happy, prosperous and secure future. The adoption of the historic United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982 has also enabled us to own and sustainably manage a huge area of ocean, from which we can further improve our well- being and enjoy returns from our fisheries resources. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has also assured us that the radiation-related illnesses suffered by our people during and after the 1960s nuclear testing on Christmas Island and other parts of the world will not recur in the future. There are many other examples of how international resolutions and  instruments have contributed immensely to our national efforts to improve our island way of life. We have no doubt that other peoples and nations see the United Nations in the same light.\nAs an organization, the United Nations is bound to be constantly pulled and pushed between two opposing\nbut interconnected interests: the personal interests of those leading and driving it, on the one hand, and the interests of the people for whom it exists, on the other. It is therefore critical that the Assembly have the ability to ensure that a balance is maintained so that the United Nations does not end up benefiting only those running and facilitating its operations.\nIn that regard, we  look  forward to the outcome  of the reform of the United Nations development system, on which our views have been adequately expressed through statements made on our behalf by the groupings of the Pacific small island developing States, the Alliance of Small Island States, the least developed countries and the Group of 77 and China. In particular, we look forward to the positioning of a new Resident Coordinator to serve the northern and central Pacific territories and countries. We also look forward to the outcome of other reforms and reviews pertaining to the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, the eligibility and graduation criteria in relation to least developed countries and, finally, the financing status of the United Nations.\nWe also fully appreciate the United Nations particular focus on the plight of people in developing countries, especially those facing special difficulties. In that connection, we note with gratitude the Committee for Development Policy\u2019s recognition of Kiribati\u2019s extreme vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and the need for special support. That gratitude extends to the President and members of the Economic and Social Council for agreeing to our request to have our graduation case considered in three years\u2019 time.\nWe are concerned to learn  from  the  report  of the Secretary-General (A/73/1) about the financial difficulties facing the United Nations to the extent that it is affecting not only its services but also the well- being of its staff. We understand that the United Nations has been relying more on voluntary contributions and private-sector funding than assessed membership contributions, which is a significant risk. It is therefore high time for us to reassess the validity of certain activities of the United Nations that have outlived their time and the need to realign strategies that were quite applicable and effective during the post-war years, when States were the key drivers of United Nations services. Those are no longer effective with United Nations services becoming the exclusive domain of huge multinational corporations that often put profit- making over moral and ethical considerations.\n \nOne example is the hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually on peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. Those funds could have been better spent on eliminating the root causes of conflicts, armed terrorism and humanitarian crises by investing United Nations resources in the establishment of good governance, with good-quality, free education and health services. In that way, the collective resources of the world can be spent to treat the causes and not merely the symptoms.\nKiribati presented, for the first time, its voluntary national review report to the United Nations in July. As I stressed in the video introduction of our review, Kiribati has now embarked on a bold and bright narrative that carries our people\u2019s voice and determination, boosted by various resilience-building programmes allowing us to forge ahead with a 20-year road map and transforming Kiribati into a wealthy, healthy  and  peaceful nation by 2036. That is  our Kiribati 20-year vision, known  as KV20, which aspires to move the nation and people beyond orthodoxy through the unleashing of the enormous potentials vested in our fisheries and tourism. I must, however, emphasize that underpinning the drive and implementation of that ambitious aspiration is making Kiribati a corruption-free society, as part of our strong commitment to championing anti-corruption in the Pacific.\nWe will follow through on that with the regional leaders meeting on anti-corruption, to be held on our shores in 2019. Corruption undeniably poses a human risk to all forms of development, and it is the weak and the marginalized who suffer and bear the highest cost of such unethical practices. Kiribati has also, for the first time ever, launched a climate change policy. That focuses on building and strengthening the resilience  of our islands and people in adapting to the impacts  of climate change. The policy highlights priority areas in water management, sanitation, coastal protection and renewable energy, and will serve as the country\u2019s national compass for the delivery of all climate-change programmes in Kiribati. We acknowledge our many partners that have worked and continue to work with Kiribati. We welcome those who are also ready to work and journey together with us to build and strengthen the resilience of our people and islands.\nTo that end, I am pleased to reaffirm that we continue to maintain 11 per cent of our exclusive economic zone in the Phoenix Islands, comprising over 400,000 square kilometres of ocean as a marine protected area. That well-known area \u2014 the Phoenix Islands Protected\nArea \u2014 is considered to be a powerful and effective tool for the rejuvenation of tuna fisheries and other marine organisms and a source of resilient coral species, known as super corals, many of which have a lifespan of over 100 years. From our understanding of the early findings of science, the Phoenix Islands Protected Area is home to one of the richest, most diverse and most resilient marine ecosystems on the planet. It has the potential to become the most powerful source of marine life enrichment and provide solutions to many of the problems facing humankind, which the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is trying to address.\nBy closing off the area  to  commercial  fishing, we have sacrificed a substantial amount of annual income  from  fishing  licences,  which is  estimated at approximately 10 per cent of our annual fishing revenue, averaging almost $10 million  annually. While that is forgone revenue, it is part of Kiribati\u2019s strong commitment to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, I am proud  to announce that Kiribati has also declared its entire exclusive economic zone as a shark sanctuary, which has been incorporated into our national laws. In that regard, we commend current efforts to create new legally binding instruments on the use of marine biological diversity in marine areas outside our exclusive economic zone, migration and the environment, all of which are very important for small islands like Kiribati, including other nations and peoples.\nThe United Nations theme to be delivered in the next 12 months is about all the people living on this planet. That theme will be irrelevant if the United Nations continues to ignore the 20 million people who live and contribute to our shared home and to exclude them from the process. We are one family, and we therefore call for an inclusive approach enabling Taiwan to participate in international processes and to contribute to addressing areas of concern to this United Nations organ, including the implementation of the SDGs.\nFor too long, we have been confined to our human desire to dominate, while lacking consideration, compassion and respect for others as they seek to pursue sustainable development in their own  right  and space, but let us remind ourselves and the United Nations family of the equally important responsibility of recognizing a space for a United Nations prayer day. The objective in that regard is to seek divine guidance for our work agenda. Quite often, we tend to overlook the importance of divine guidance as a powerful tool\n \nthat can really unite our hearts in a shared aspiration to make the United Nations a truly global institution for all people and to build the trust, respect and love that we all need to make a genuine difference. May God\u2019s grace and compassion continue to bless our hearts as we strive to strengthen the Organization.\nIn conclusion, I wish to share Kiribati\u2019s traditional blessings of Te mauri, te raoi ao te tabomoa, which means \u201chealth, peace and prosperity to us all\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I wish to congratulate you, Madam, on your assuming the position of President of the General Assembly at its current session and provide assurances of Latvia\u2019s full support. I also express gratitude to Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his active role as President of the General Assembly at its previous session.\nI address the Assembly at a very special time for my country. This year, Latvia celebrates its centennial. A remarkable change occurred 100 years ago. The end of the First World War and the collapse of empires resulted in the liberation of nations and brought about a fundamental revision of Europe\u2019s political map. A new Europe was born, which promised much more than just self-determination, freedom and democracy. The peoples of Europe expected lasting peace and prosperity. Those objectives were pursued both individually and collectively. Peoples\u2019 right to self- determination materialized in concrete forms. New nation States were born.\nThe Paris Peace Conference laid the foundations for the League of Nations, which was the first international organization whose principal mission was\n \nto maintain universal peace through the development of binding norms and multilateralism. Latvia also joined the League of Nations, firmly establishing its status  as a full-fledged member of the international family. However, the weakness of the League of Nations was one of the main reasons why Latvia, for a  time, lost  its independence. The history of both the Soviet and Nazi occupations of Latvia and much of the European continent is a harsh reminder of what happens when serious violations of international law are tolerated. We know all too well the consequences of allowing countries to break those principles with impunity. In Latvia\u2019s case, it was a life under the occupation of Nazi and Communist regimes of terror and gross violations of human rights.\nWe are grateful to all those nations that for decades implemented policies of non-recognition of the occupation of the Republic of Latvia and stood by their principles. In accordance with international law, the State of Latvia continued to exist throughout the occupation period. However, the Russian Federation \u2014  the official successor to the Soviet Union \u2014 still does not acknowledge the well-documented facts of history. I call on Russia to embrace the truth and clearly condemn the actions of the Soviet Union.\nSince the restoration of independence in 1991, Latvia has been advocating compliance with international law and human rights. The protection of those principles was necessary throughout our transition to a democratic society, which was governed by the rule of law, and in building Latvia\u2019s international role. Today, Latvia is\na modern and proud European nation and an active\nmember of the world community.\nThe topic of this year\u2019s debate invites us to focus on the very heart of the United Nations. The Charter of the United Nations starts with the words \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d, thus pointing out the Organization\u2019s aim to represent the rights and interests of every human being on the planet. The United Nations was founded not only to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights but also to respect the obligations of international law.\nHuman rights, including women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, are among the most fundamental values of the United Nations. The Organization  must  be  capable of defending those  values  in  any  situation,  be  it  the bombing of civilians in Syria, the massacre of Rohingyas in Myanmar, the persecution of Crimean Tatars by the Russian authorities or other human rights violations wherever they occur. This year, we mark 70 years since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It remains the main global source of inspiration to continue working to ensure that all people may live with dignity and benefit from the blessings of freedom and equality.\nSecurity and human rights go hand in hand. Security cannot be achieved without respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The freedom of the press has been and continues to be vital to peace, justice and human rights for all. I therefore once again urge Russia to release the illegally detained Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov. I call on the Myanmar authorities to free the two Reuters journalists Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone. I also call on Russia to immediately release the other 64 Ukrainian political prisoners it has detained, including journalist Roman Sushchenko. I urge nations to adhere to their commitments and obligations under international law and international human rights law, especially with regard to the freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, which have notably deteriorated in the past year.\nIn order to strengthen the role of the United Nations, efforts should be made to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of  the United Nations. In August, the world  lost an inspirational leader and   a strong advocate for peace and human rights, former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who argued that we will not enjoy security without development, nor\n \ndevelopment without security, and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights. The three pillars of the Charter are greater than the sum of their individual parts. Economic progress and sustainable development are based on long-term stability, which in turn requires peace and security and respect for human rights.\nThe United Nations must be able to change, undertake serious reforms and thereby respond to the demands of the twenty-first century accordingly. We need a relevant and efficient United Nations. Latvia welcomes the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General in the three areas of peace and security, development and management. It is important that the reforms be implemented swiftly. This is a unique Organization with a heavy responsibility. The authority of the Security Council in maintaining international peace and security must be preserved. Security Council  reform is long overdue, and we should all aim to strengthen the efficiency of that important body. However, the stalemate in the reform of the Security Council must not impede progress elsewhere. The reform of the United Nations must include serious improvements in the protection and promotion of human rights.\nAchieving sustainable development through the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cannot be complete without strengthening human rights around the world. The Human Rights Council must be strong and effective and have the ability to react quickly to serious human rights violations in any part of the world. Latvia is actively engaged in the process of improving the effectiveness of the Council. I invite all countries to join that process with an open mind.\nLatvia supports the Secretary-General\u2019s vision and approach with regard to focusing on prevention at the United Nations. That is even more important given the increasingly complex global security challenges that we face. Conflicts and crises around the world that could not be prevented drag on for years and decades, destroying human lives, holding back development and draining the resources of the United Nations.\nThe conflicts in Syria, Ukraine and Yemen continue to take a heavy toll on civilians. We must also not forget the protracted instability in Burundi and Afghanistan. The mere length of preventable conflicts undermines the credibility of international organizations, including the United Nations.\nAs the main guarantor of  international  peace  and security, the Security Council has a particular responsibility in preventing conflicts, acts of aggression and mass atrocities. The use of the veto to shield narrow national interests in situations of mass atrocities is completely unacceptable.\nTerritorial integrity and sovereignty, as enshrined in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, must be respected by all. The Russian Federation must stop its aggression against Ukraine. Together with the international community, we will maintain a non-recognition policy with regard to the illegal annexation of Crimea. I believe that one day international law and justice will  prevail  and  that  the territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as that of other eastern partners of the  European  Union,  will be restored. The United Nations, along with relevant regional players, must remain involved and committed to resolving the protracted conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The history of the Baltic States is proof of the moral power of international law and justice. The international community must be more active in resolving those issues.\nNo nation was ever secure in isolation. Member States therefore have a responsibility to ensure one another\u2019s security. Clear consequences for aggressors, resolute international pressure and accountability for violations of international law are essential for the political resolution of a conflict. Settlement of the protracted conflicts in wider Europe remains of the utmost importance to the international community.\nAttaining the Sustainable Development Goals is the ultimate prevention agenda. They address the drivers and root causes of instability and conflict. Investing in human dignity, eradicating poverty, fostering climate resilience and promoting economic and social progress will reduce the incidence of conflict, instability and despair.\nThe principles of good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, gender equality and environmental sustainability therefore guide all Latvia\u2019s activities in the area of development cooperation. Furthermore, gender equality is  vital  to  achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. It is an essential precondition for inclusive sustainable development and for economic growth and prosperity.\n \nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, combatants accounted for 90 per cent of conflict- related casualties. Today, 90 per cent of casualties in armed conflicts are civilians. Conventional arms kill approximately 500,000 people a year, of whom 70,000 are killed in conflict zones. Those figures clearly prove that the international community must focus not only on weapons of mass destruction but also on conventional arms.\nWith that in mind, Latvia will assume the presidency of the Arms Trade Treaty next year and will spare no effort to promote its objectives. I call on all States to become parties to the Arms Trade Treaty, which would also contribute directly to the attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe must join efforts to strengthen the principle of multilateralism. In an interdependent and globalized world, we can address and resolve global problems only through multilateral means. In that regard, the United Nations stands out as a good global governance instrument, but it is not a global Government. The ability of  the United Nations to meet the challenges of the world today depends heavily on  the decisions of Governments and on the support of populations for those decisions. With that in mind, I wish to emphasize that the future of multilateralism will  depend  more on changes in the attitudes of Member States than on reforms of the United Nations system. However, as long as the fundamental characteristics of the international system are not changed, the United Nations can only strive for higher effectiveness and efficiency.\nWe should accept the United Nations for what it is. It is not perfect, yet it is a very necessary instrument for the maintenance of peace, economic development and the codification of international law for a more secure world. The United Nations can and must be a significant global player, a community of nations that is proud of its values and committed to multilateralism and the principles of international law.\nMember States must support  our  Organization  in order to project those values worldwide, thereby affirming its unique role on the global stage. To achieve that purpose, the United Nations needs well-functioning norms, efficient institutions and a clear vision of its policies.\n"

Chad assures her of our support as she strives to fulfil her noble mission.\nWe would also like to express our sincere thanks and great appreciation to her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for the quality of the work conducted and the convincing results achieved during his term. On behalf of Chad, I would also like to recognize the leadership of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and thank him for his continued commitment to strengthening the role of the United Nations and promoting its partnership with regional organizations, particularly the African Union.\nChad welcomes the relevance of the President\u2019s strategic vision for this session, \u201cDialogue and strengthening of multilateralism as a catalyst for the well-being of all persons and a sustainable planet\u201d. The choice of this theme is justified in many ways. We live in a world experiencing perpetual change where we are confronted with the serious consequences of climate change, conflicts and crises, underdevelopment, unprecedented    migratory    flows,     nationalism and isolationism.\nIn a world so deeply troubled and exposed to such diverse and grave perils, humankind has no choice but to further unite around the shared universal values underpinning the establishment of the United Nations, a melting pot of nations and peoples of the world aspiring to live together in peace, mutual respect, solidarity, complementarity and a common destiny. Our future, as well as that of generations to come for whom we are responsible, depend on it.\n \nMore than anywhere else, Africa in general and the countries of the Sahel in particular are experiencing the combined negative effects of all these aforementioned scourges. My country, Chad, surrounded by hotbeds of conflict and crisis and in  a  region  characterized by burgeoning terrorism, illicit trafficking  of  all kinds \u2014 including human trafficking related to illegal immigration \u2014 transnational crime, drought and desertification, is deeply affected.\nOn the basis of the firm conviction that there can be no development, peace or stability without security, Chad, despite its meagre resources, has been obliged to engage on several fronts in the fight against terrorism, across the Lake Chad basin and the Sahel.  Despite the immense sacrifices made both individually and collectively with the countries of the subregion, the terrorist threat remains present and persistent and jeopardizes all our development efforts.\nTerrorist groups linked to vast criminal networks of all kinds of heavily armed and wealthy traffickers continue to test our individual response capabilities. This does not begin to cover the efforts required to address other security challenges such as mercenaries, the circulation and proliferation of weapons, poaching, deforestation, piracy and conflicts related to environmental degradation.\nAlthough it is true that the collective commitment and determination of the member States of the Lake Chad Basin Commission have led, within the framework of the Multinational Joint Task Force, to the military defeat of the terrorist group Boko Haram, the group clearly remains capable of causing harm. The Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) member countries  are working just as hard to deal with other terrorist groups operating in this area with their support base in southern Libya.\nThe fight against terrorism continues with determination from our States, some  of  the  poorest in the world, within the framework of both the Multinational Joint Task Force and the G-5 Sahel. Such work is conducted on behalf and in the interest of all our States and therefore deserves the  full attention and support of the international community, more so through action than through statements and promises often left unfulfilled.\nPeace and security are essential for long-term progress and sustainable development. The stability  of a region has far-reaching benefits for neighbouring\nregions and beyond, which gives  rise  to  the  need  for a comprehensive approach and coherent and coordinated collective action to address the root causes of terrorism and conflict, including poverty, ignorance and underdevelopment.\nIn this regard, I firmly reiterate the call made by the Heads of State of the G-5 Sahel member countries at their summit held on 6 February in Niamey, the Niger, asking the members of the Security Council to place the G-5 Sahel Joint Force, whose purpose is to fight the threat of terrorism, under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, in order to secure its sustainable funding and a mandate commensurate with the scope of this international threat. The  operationalization and increased power and effectiveness of the Force depend largely and fundamentally on the mobilization of resources dedicated to this cause. I would also like to reiterate our sincere thanks to Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his steadfast commitment, principled positions and advocacy for this legitimate request of the G-5 Sahel.\nAs Chad advances on the path towards socioeconomic development, which  is  a  guarantee  of peace, stability and security, and drawing upon lessons from past and present experiences, my country intends to give priority to our partnerships to achieve concrete results measured in terms of improving the living conditions of our people. In this context, we welcome the ongoing reform of the United Nations Development Support System, which seeks to move away from an assistance-based model to emphasize resilience through sustainable development. We hope that this new approach will take into account the need for regular dialogue, the genuine needs of countries and their priorities when it comes to choosing projects, Government involvement in implementing, monitoring and evaluating projects, and the streamlining of project approval and disbursement procedures.\nIn the same vein, we welcome the approach of reviewing the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel through the United Nations Support Plan for the Sahel. We also stress the need to thoroughly involve the countries concerned in the review process and to take their priorities into account.\nDespite multiple security, environmental and socioeconomic challenges, Chad initiated, in 2015, the drafting of two documents on its medium- and long-term development, \u201cVision 2030: the Chad we want\u201d, and its\n \nfirst five-year national development plan  2017-2021, in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Government\u2019s approval of these two documents  in July 2017 was followed by the presentation of the national development plan at the round table in Paris in September 2017. I would like to take this opportunity to make, on behalf of my Government, a heartfelt call to all our partners to fulfil the pledges announced at the round table. Keeping these promises is vital for Chad.\nThe Government of the Republic of Chad, well aware of the prominent role played by women in the country\u2019s development process, is tackling the gender issue as an essential component of and a key priority in the formulation and implementation of public policies. For this purpose, through a law adopted on 22 May, His Excellency Mr. Idriss  Deby  Itno,  President  of the Republic and Head of State, made it compulsory for 30 per cent of all civil servant appointments and elective positions to be set aside for women, with the ultimate goal of gradually achieving gender parity. This quota has already  shown  its  effectiveness  in  its implementation.\nIn addition,  we  have  taken  specific  measures  to ensure the development of women, including the promotion of girls\u2019 education and the adoption of a  law prohibiting their early marriage. This law sets the minimum age for marriage at 18 years and provides for a prison term of five to 10 years for those who violate this prohibition.\nThe Lake Chad Conventional Basin is the place where the dramatic consequences of the combined effect of terrorist attacks and climate change on the vulnerable populations, victims of these two scourges, as well as on the environment, are most visible. We must remember that living around Lake Chad are more than 45 million people of diverse origin who bear the full brunt of the consequences of the drying up of Lake Chad, seriously undermining their livelihoods and drastically limiting their resilience capabilities.\nThe surface area of the Lake Chad has decreased from 25,000 square kilometres 40 years ago to less than 2,500 square kilometres, and the risk of its disappearance is very real. The efforts of four riparian countries and other members of the Lake Chad Basin Commission aimed at saving it are far from adequate to respond to the enormity of the task alone. The gradual disappearance of Lake Chad constitutes a major ecological disaster with serious consequences for food\nsecurity and stability in the Sahel, as evidenced by the scarcity of natural resources and the development of the terrorist threat. That is why the international community as a whole must mobilize to lobby to save Lake Chad by supporting the joint initiative of UNESCO and the Lake Chad Basin Commission to register Lake Chad as a biosphere reservation and a World Heritage Site.\nThe international community is capable of achieving and must help to achieve this noble goal, which is perfectly aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this regard, Chad once again urges all parties to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to fulfil their commitments.\nMigration management remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Thousands of African migrants, driven by desperation, are constantly trying to reach Europe and risking their lives in the process. The flow of migrants will not cease so long  as  the root causes of migration persist, including poverty, underdevelopment, conflict and lack of opportunity for African young people. In addition to this are factors such as demographic pressure and the adverse effects of climate change, further accentuating the vulnerability of African societies. In the absence of appropriate sustainable migration management mechanisms that take into account the root causes of the phenomenon, we will never be able to put an end to the tragedy of thousands of people dying at  sea or  in the desert or  to scenes from another era, such as that of African migrants being sold at auction as slaves.\nIn that regard, we must all make a significant effort to promote economic and social development in the countries of origin and transit of migrants in order to stabilize the situation. Improving our cooperation with those countries is the best way to curb illegal migration. Similarly, urgent measures must be taken to help those currently trapped in transit camps or caught in situations of slavery or serious violence. We must collectively call on States where migrants are subjected to such violence to respect their basic rights and to bring their migration management methods in line with the rule of law. The best way for all of us to address migration challenges is to put in place flexible mechanisms for legal migration and to consider these phenomena, which have existed since time immemorial, as a means of bringing people closer together and not as a threat.\n \nAt the continental and international levels, Chad, while remaining concerned about the persistence of conflict zones here and there, welcomes the progress made in some countries. In the Central African Republic, Chad welcomes the commitment of the Central African authorities and the 14 armed groups to entering the path of dialogue under the auspices of the Panel of Facilitators of the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic. Chad reaffirms its support for the African Initiative, which is led by the African Union and supported by the entire international community. The restoration of trust and the beginning of true reconciliation are within the reach of the brotherly Central African people. We call on all bilateral and multilateral partners to provide the necessary resources for the implementation of the African Initiative.\nIn Mali, Chad welcomes the  successful holding  of  peaceful  presidential   elections   and   reiterates its congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on his decisive re-election, which reflects the commitment of the Malian people to the ongoing political process and peace. Chad encourages all Malian stakeholders to fully implement the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, and reaffirms its commitment to supporting Mali in its stabilization phase.\nIn South Sudan, Chad welcomes the peace agreement recently signed in Addis Ababa by South Sudanese actors and congratulates the Intergovernmental Authority on Development on the fruits of its tireless efforts. Chad urges all parties to the agreement to implement it in good faith.\nChad also welcomes the very positive developments in the Horn of Africa,  characterized by the rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as that between Eritrea and Djibouti, and hopes to see these processes continue.\nIn Libya, Chad calls on all Libyan parties to give priority to dialogue and reconciliation over armed conflict. We encourage them to use their goodwill and common sense to turn the page on violence. In this regard, the international community must facilitate dialogue and inclusive reconciliation as an immediate priority with a view to restoring peace and ultimately holding credible, transparent and peaceful elections. It should be recalled that the Libyan crisis has serious security consequences for neighbouring countries, including\nChad, as a result of the chaos in southern Libya, which is a lawless area that serves as a haven for terrorist groups, mercenary gangs and all kinds of traffickers. In this regard, we invite all our partners to support the efforts undertaken by Libya, the Niger, the Sudan and Chad within the framework of the agreement signed on 31 May in N\u2019Djamena among the four countries, with a view to securing their common borders.\nIn Yemen, Chad reaffirms its support for United Nations efforts to promote a political solution to the crisis and urges the Yemeni actors concerned to give priority to dialogue and comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nIn Syria, Chad reiterates its support for United Nations mediation efforts and calls on the parties to the conflict to put an end to the suffering they have inflicted on their people for  more  than seven  years by ending the violence and committing themselves resolutely to dialogue and reconciliation. Chad calls on the belligerents to respect international humanitarian law and to facilitate the delivery of aid to civilians.\nWith regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Chad reiterates its commitment to a two-State solution with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace, stability and security within the June 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.\nWith regard to Cuba, Chad notes with concern  the deterioration of that country\u2019s relations with the United States and encourages both sides to continue the process of normalizing their relations. Chad reiterates its call for the lifting of the embargo imposed on Cuba.\nI cannot conclude my remarks without addressing the issue of United Nations reform, namely, Security Council reform, which remains a major ongoing concern for Africa. Chad stresses the urgent need to redress the injustice done to Africa by accelerating the long- awaited reform to reflect the realities of today\u2019s world in the United Nations system. The African common position on this point deserves to be taken into account by all States Members of the United Nations if we genuinely want to involve Africa in global governance. Like it or not, the Africa of the twenty-first century is indispensable, and its voice must be heard by the rest of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate the President on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I would also like to thank her predecessor for his outstanding work during the previous session. Finally, I also want to convey my country\u2019s appreciation of the valuable efforts being made by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\nThis year, the United Arab Emirates is celebrating the centennial of the birth of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founder of our union and a leader whose vision entrenched the basis and values of the noble humanity in my country and transformed it into a successful political, economic and social model. As we celebrate the centennial of the birth of our founding leader, we realize that we are not isolated from our surroundings and that our success has increased our humanitarian responsibilities as an Arab country towards a region that faces numerous challenges.\nOver the past few years, we have witnessed major changes in the international order, the consequences  of which are becoming more apparent each day, most\nnotably the rise of armed terrorist groups that rely on extremist ideologies and seek to destabilize and control countries. What is even more dangerous is the support that rogue States are providing to such groups.\nAmid those dangerous challenges, which affect the security and stability of every State, especially in our region, it has become imperative for us to be more active in maintaining regional security by strengthening partnerships aimed at addressing current challenges. We realize that we cannot continue to rely on other States to solve the crises in our region. No single country, regardless of its capabilities, can alone restore security and stability, because confronting the transnational challenges that we face is a collective responsibility.\nIn our endeavour to achieve regional security and stability, my country has followed a comprehensive approach that addresses the various dimensions of the threats in our region, which we believe can be summed up as the following four challenges. The first challenge is foreign interference in the affairs of the Arab world. Certain countries of the region, particularly Iran, seek to undermine the security of the region by spreading chaos, violence and sectarianism. Iran\u2019s interference in Arab affairs has reached an unprecedented level. Ever since those threats reached Yemen and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is a sister to all of us, we can no longer afford to remain mere spectators. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continues to be subjected to a barrage of Iranian ballistic missiles.\nThe security of countries in the region is interdependent, and our security is tied to that of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. That is why we responded by joining the coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen, which seeks to put an end to the Houthi coup and confront Iran\u2019s interference. It is critical in that regard to differentiate between the behaviour of illegitimate armed groups that are committing serious violations and criminal and subversive acts in Yemen, such  as the Houthis, and the legitimate  measures  taken  by the coalition, which was formed at the request of the legitimate Yemeni Government. The coalition\u2019s goal  is to restore stability by taking measured steps that take into account humanitarian aspects and are in accordance with Security Council resolutions.\nDespite the coalition\u2019s tireless efforts to restore stability in Yemen and alleviate the suffering of its people, the intransigence of the Houthis in resisting serious peace initiatives, as proved by their absence\n \nfrom the recent Geneva talks, has exacerbated the humanitarian situation in Yemen. The Houthis continue to obstruct humanitarian assistance and to receive Iranian arms, plant landmines and recruit children. In the light of those serious developments, the forces of the coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen launched their military operations in Yemen to liberate Al-Hudaydah from the grip of the Houthis in order to achieve a strategic shift that would enhance the prospects for reaching a political solution. As the coalition carries out its operations in Al-Hudaydah and other areas in Yemen, the humanitarian aspects have always been taken into account. Hence, the Al-Hudaydah operation was planned and implemented in accordance  with  our obligations under international law. We have also strengthened and expanded our humanitarian aid and emergency relief.\nAt the same time as we are acting to counter the Houthis in the north of Yemen, my country will continue its fight against Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. That terrorist group was severely impacted after the coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen was able to severely damage its forces, cut off its sources of finance and liberate the territories that were under its control.\nMistrust in Iran\u2019s intentions and concerns regarding its regional ambitions are not limited to our region. Those concerns were also reflected in the decision taken by the United States to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear agreement and to reimpose sanctions on Iran, which has never ceased its aggressive behaviour in the region or abandoned its intention to develop weapons of mass destruction, even when the international community granted it the opportunity to rectify its policies and behaviour. In that regard, we stress the importance of a united international position against Iran that addresses that country\u2019s development of ballistic missiles, its support for terrorist groups and its use of proxy wars to undermine regional and international security.\nThe second challenge  that  the  region  is  facing is the spread of extremism and terrorism and the exploitation of modern technology by extremist and terrorist groups in order to disseminate their dangerous ideologies. Although we have made some promising advances against those extremist and terrorist groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen and have liberated certain cities in Libya, our fight will continue until the scourge is eliminated.\nThe situation is becoming more dangerous as some States establish media platforms that incite hatred and serve as rostrums for extremist and terrorist groups. We are facing  extremist  and terrorist  ideologies  that are equally responsible for the acts of violence committed in the name of those ideologies. The United Arab Emirates has therefore been at the forefront of States combating extremism and terrorism in both the ideological and the security realms. In addition, my country has supported international forces such as the Group of Five for the Sahel joint force as part of our efforts to eliminate extremism and terrorism wherever it exists. My country has also established specialized institutions to counter extremist narratives, promote tolerance and disseminate a culture of accepting others and an optimistic vision at all national, regional and international levels.\nConvinced that lasting and global peace can be achieved only through peace between religions, the Forum for Promoting Peace launched an international initiative to build an alliance among the Abrahamic religions and world philosophies. That alliance is based on principles that transcend the paradigm of religious arguments and conflicts. It is  based  on  a  paradigm of mutual recognition and cooperation, guided by international covenants and the spirit of our noble values and common virtues.\nWe stress that our values, which reject both extremism and terrorism, are steadfast and unchanging. We emphasize that our policies to counter and combat the supporters of extremism, violence and hatred make no distinction between a group and a State. To that end, the United Arab Emirates, along with its brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Kingdom of Bahrain, has taken sovereign measures against Qatar. Those measures are pivotal and decisive in confronting extremism and terrorism, and are considered imperative to achieving a secure region.\nThe third challenge is posed by the prolonged crises in the region, which are merely managed in the absence of political solutions. In that regard, the United Arab Emirates will persist in supporting the existing political initiatives, including by working with all United Nations envoys. In that connection, the Palestinian question continues to wait for the international community to reach a comprehensive, lasting and just solution  to end the suffering of our Palestinian brothers. We must underscore that this continued humanitarian tragedy is being exploited by extremist groups and rogue States.\n \nLastly, we believe that the deterioration in the economic, social and humanitarian conditions in the parts of our region is one of the main challenges we face. The successful experience of the United Arab Emirates has led us to believe that wise leadership,  the determination to achieve prosperity and a forward- looking approach are key to building nations and protecting them. My country\u2019s foreign policy therefore includes developmental, humanitarian and cultural dimensions in order to support the needs of the people and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nAt the core of the development dimension is the strengthening of economic opportunities and the empowerment of women and youth in countries affected by conflict. We believe that rebuilding Iraq is a prime example of the importance of uniting efforts to help countries recovering from conflict. The international community has to support peaceful and inclusive communities, including through the protection of minorities and the prevention of atrocities committed against them, such as the crimes committed against the Yazidis and the Rohingya.\nMy country is also playing a vital role in promoting humanitarian and relief assistance to areas  affected by conflicts and disasters around the world. The United Arab Emirates aspires to transform the whole region into a global centre for technology, culture and innovation after decades of crises. My country focuses on anticipating challenges and on investing in advanced fields, such as artificial intelligence, space technology and renewable energy. I  would  like  to  emphasize that empowering women and youth and investing in their unlimited skills contribute to building resilient and cohesive societies and, eventually, stable  and  safe countries.\nToday, our Arab region is in dire need of a comprehensive regional transformation that will bring it out of chaos and into stability, and out of isolation and unilateralism into openness and planning for the future. We are cognizant that achieving that transformation will not be easy and that our efforts will succeed only by intensifying collective action. Most importantly, each State must fulfil its responsibilities to reach that goal.\nI would like to underscore the vital role of the United Nations in supporting political processes, strengthening dialogue and building confidence among Governments so as to maintain international peace and security, especially given the worrying uncertainty\nthat currently defines the international order. The United Arab Emirates views the historic agreement reached between Ethiopia and Eritrea, under the auspices of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as significant motivation for the international community to strengthen its diplomatic efforts.\nIn addition, the international community must take a firm and consistent stance towards States that have hostile policies and violate international law and the Charter of the United Nations. The United Arab Emirates reiterates its demand for its legitimate right to sovereignty over its three islands \u2014 Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which Iran has occupied for 47 years, in flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We call once again upon Iran from this rostrum to respond to our repeated\n \ncalls and return our rights to where they belong, either voluntarily or through the available peaceful means for resolving international disputes, at the top of which are direct negotiations or referral to the International Court of Justice or international arbitration.\nI would like to emphasize that the vision of the United Arab Emirates for the region is based on the values upon which our country was founded, the positive outcomes already achieved by my country at the national level, and our regional experiences in the region side by side with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with whom we  share an optimistic vision and hope for achieving a brighter future for our region and for all peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to express the sympathies of the Government and the people of Belize with the Government and the people of Indonesia in the light of the recent devastating earthquake and tsunami that has killed more than\n400 people. I also want to express  our  solidarity  with Barbados and Saint Lucia, fellow Caribbean Community countries, which are recovering from Tropical Storm Kirk, as well as with the countries of the Eastern Caribbean that have been affected by an earthquake in the past few days.\nThis year marks the thirty-seventh anniversary of Belize\u2019s independence. Belizeans have now enjoyed almost four uninterrupted decades of freedom, peace and democracy in our sovereign independent nation. During that period our leaders have succeeded in making modest gains in our nation\u2019s quest for sustainable development. They did so notwithstanding the fact that our country has been the subject of an active territorial claim \u2014 a poisoned colonial chalice \u2014 that predates our independence by approximately a half century. Because of that claim, our nation\u2019s birth was protracted and fraught with difficulty. All Belizeans who are familiar with the history of our journey to independence give the United Nations great credit for it,  and rightly so.  It was resolution 1514 (XV), adopted on 14 December 1960, that paved the way for all colonial peoples to be able to make  the  transition to  independence. Belize is a beneficiary of that seminal resolution and of the subsequent United Nations resolutions adopted between 1971 and 1980 that mandated the British to grant it early independence.\nOn 21 September 1981, Belize achieved its independence, and the United Nations immediately welcomed our fledgling democratic State as its newest Member, thereby affirming its sovereignty and its\n \nterritorial integrity. Yet 37 years later the Guatemalan territorial claim remains unresolved. Indeed, efforts to resolve it before the International Court of Justice eluded the British Government for nearly 80 years. However, Belizeans will soon \u2014 and thankfully \u2014 decide whether the current opportunity to bring about a definitive settlement of the claim, which has long sown fear in the hearts of all Belizeans and has hamstrung our nation\u2019s development potential, will in fact be seized.\nThe significance of the 15 April 2017 Guatemalan referendum, which ratified the decision of the Guatemalan Government in 2008 to have its claim relating to my country adjudicated by the Court, should not be lost. For, in carrying out the referendum, Guatemala gave effect to its obligation under the special agreement that both our countries signed in good faith. At the same time, there remains one pending issue for us to agree on. In continuing that spirit of good faith, we urge our neighbour Guatemala to agree on a procedure or protocol for confidence-building measures on the Sarstoon River, our southern boundary with that country, in order to facilitate the management of incidents of the kind that gave rise to heightened tensions between our two countries in 2015 and 2016.\nBelizeans are now on the cusp of a truly rare and felicitous moment in our nation\u2019s history. Our voting public, in the finest democratic fashion, now has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to determine the fate of our country. The Government of Belize has designated 10 April 2019 as the date for our national referendum. On that day all registered voters will be entitled to cast their ballots, thereby signalling either their consent to or rejection of having the Guatemalan claim resolved once and for all by the International Court of Justice. In preparation for that historic plebiscite, our Government has embarked on a nationwide public awareness campaign to ensure that all Belizeans are fully informed about the claim and why it should be referred to the Court for resolution.\nWhile working to end the Guatemalan claim and thereby enhance our national security, my Government continues to discharge its core duty of promoting economic development, job creation, education and health care for all citizens. To that end, we are making major efforts to implement our growth and sustainable development strategy, which is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. In  that  endeavour the United Nations development system is partnering\nwith us through the Multi-country Sustainable Development Framework.\nWe are also working diligently to address the scourge of the poverty that persistently afflicts our country and our citizens. Current statistics show that approximately 43 per cent of Belizeans live below the poverty line, with\n16 per cent experiencing extreme poverty. Initiatives aimed at dealing with the problem include three new programmes that specifically target indigent families. In addition to financial benefits, beneficiaries are provided with direct economic, social and psychological support as well as job readiness courses to prepare them for gainful employment. Under a food pantry programme, poor families are also provided with basic food baskets at subsidized rates.\nAn alarming knowledge gap is rapidly widening between the few fortunate Belizeans who are well educated, skilled and poised to succeed in a fiercely competitive, knowledge-based twenty-first century environment and the many who are being left behind without the skills and wherewithal to obtain employment, become self-employed or even to engage legitimately and meaningfully in civic life. It is indispensable to Belize\u2019s development, prosperity, security and democracy that we work to close that knowledge gap as soon as possible and ensure that all our young people are equipped to successfully face the myriad challenges of the twenty- first century.\nTo that end, and with a view to increasing access to education, our Government is building 35 new schools. Since the launch of a high school subsidy, we have seen a discernible improvement in transition rates from primary to secondary school for  students  identified as having academic or socioeconomic challenges. All students in the country\u2019s districts and rural areas with the highest incidence of poverty automatically qualify for the subsidy. This year the Government is expanding its reach with the intention of minimizing the disparity in enrolment and achievement between students from rural and urban areas.\nIn addition, the Government is taking new measures to assist at-risk young people from coming into conflict with our laws. We recently launched the Belize Youth Challenge Programme, which concentrates on teaching young people   discipline,   personal   organization and teamwork, as well as skills in technical and vocational areas, and on encouraging them to become responsible, patriotic and productive citizens. With a\n \nview to enhancing the delivery of health services, the Government has initiated steps for the construction of a modern hospital in the Toledo district.\nNext year will mark 25 years of the Organization\u2019s support for the small island developing States (SIDS) agenda. Belize joins in the call for renewed commitment to the special case of SIDS and for systematically targeted support to respond to their particular needs, such as those identified by the Caribbean SIDS in the San Pedro Declaration, adopted in Belize in August 2017. The destructive hurricanes and storms that ravage the Caribbean year after year are a constant reminder of the true scale of thevulnerability facing SIDS in the Caribbean. We hope that through the implementation of his reform plan the Secretary-General will explore ways by which the United Nations development system can better accelerate the implementation of the SIDS agenda.\nOur Government has made  building  resilience  an integral part of its development planning and is implementing a national climate resilience investment plan to ensure that the impact of climate change is integrated into national investment planning across all sectors and ministries. The Government has also enacted mangrove regulations and instituted an indefinite moratorium on offshore drilling, which marks the first time that a developing country has taken such a major step to protect its marine resources from oil exploration and extraction. Belize will also be banning single-use plastics and Styrofoam as of April 2019.\nI am happy to share that UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Committee recently decided to remove the Belize barrier reef, the largest in the western hemisphere, from the World Heritage in Danger list, after taking into account several measures that our Government has implemented to ensure its protection and well-being.\nThanks to its geography, Belize is located along a path frequented by criminal elements of every kind as they journey from South to North to traffic their illicit wares, a fact that has had tragic consequences for the peace and safety of Belizeans. Over the past decade the problem has led to a dramatic increase in our homicide rates, with each year being deadlier than the one before. Tackling transnational organized crime in Central America requires a truly cooperative and collaborative approach, along with multilateral support. Thankfully, UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\nhave been important and faithful collaborators with our Government in implementing programmes to address underlying social causes and build the capacity of protective and judicial institutions.\nWhat I have spoken of here makes it clear that the United Nations is of inestimable value and importance to Belize. Like other States Members of the United Nations, Belize is well aware of its limitations, but it is not without anxiety that we note the fact that some of its core values are under sustained attack, while organs that have been painstakingly erected to reinforce the rule of law are being derided and international legal frameworks are being cast aside in unilateral acts of political expediency.\nParadoxically, the criticisms and attacks are being unleashed at a time when the world is most in need of a robust United Nations, as nations large and small are being buffeted by catastrophic occurrences, both natural and man-made, at a pace never before witnessed by humankind. While we appreciate the need for reform of the institutions of the United Nations, we are therefore equally mindful of its  unique and  invaluable  role  in a world that is becoming increasingly more perilous. Belize fears that, if we stand in silence or fail to speak out in its defence and in defence of multilateralism,  we risk repeating the tragedies of the past, and we forsake the very values that the United Nations stands for. Indeed, we forsake our very responsibility to humankind. History will measure us by our actions, not by our words.\nBelize supports all initiatives that seek to put an end to the conflicts languishing across the globe that lead to senseless death, destruction and suffering. We echo the cry of Palestinians for an independent State, within its 1967 borders and with all attendant rights. We pray that the International Court of Justice will bring a speedy end to Venezuela\u2019s claim over Guyanan territory. Belize remains firm and unwavering in its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Guyana. We also pray that the civil strife in Venezuela will soon end.\nBelize joins the call for an end to the unilateral, economic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba and its people, which violates international law and serves no just purpose. The blockade has failed to pressure the Government into submission. Indeed, it has had the opposite effect. Leveraging its inexhaustible reserves of patriotism and creativity, Cuba has been\n \nable to survive and thrive to a degree that has garnered international recognition for its resilience, its selfless generosity and its signal gains in public health, education and the arts. Surely it is high time, after nearly 58 years, to lift the blockade so that Cuba can reach the highest level of its extraordinary potential.\nIn a similar spirit of determination, Belize reiterates its plea on behalf of the 23 million people of Taiwan for a new approach to Taiwan\u2019s participation in the United Nations system. Taiwan is the twenty-second-largest economy in the world. It is a vibrant democracy that has fully embraced international norms and standards. Yet, despite global recognition of its successes and the readiness of States Members of the  United  Nations to conduct business with this fast-growing economy, the Organization has cut them off. It has gone so far  as to refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Taiwanese passports, thereby even preventing Taiwanese tourists from entering its premises as visitors. It effectively uses resolution 2758 (XXXVI), of 1971, as a political and humanitarian embargo on Taiwan. In our view, no such embargo has any place in the United Nations.\nThe successes of the United Nations have never been won by focusing on what divides us. Had we done so we would not have achieved a landmark human rights declaration, a transformative development agenda or a constitution for the oceans and seas, and we certainly would not have a framework agreement for collective action on climate change. Focusing on what unites us can bring us further along the path towards addressing the gaps in the law of the sea to guarantee that fairness extends even into areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nSimilarly, we can take a final decision  in Poland to give full effect to the Paris Agreement and mobilize momentum for the level of ambition and the magnitude of support needed to avoid irreversible adverse effects of climate change. Belize is ready to commit to raising our ambition and urges others to join us in 2020 to set the world on the right path towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals.\nIn conclusion, in our humble defence of what rightly belongs to us, Belize has weathered many trials. We see our struggle reflected in those of many others who have been denied the full enjoyment of their rights and the full achievement of their potential. However, we are secure in our belief that right will triumph and that in the end, our shared values of justice and our belief in human dignity will bring us ever closer to the\nresolutions the world needs. We therefore march on, in service of the United Nations and all the peoples of the world, armed with our values and an enduring hope for peace and security."

        "file_text": "Allow me  at  the outset to sincerely congratulate the President on her well- deserved election as the fourth woman to ascend to the highest seat at the United Nations. Although we are happy about her election, we can certainly take no pride in our own record as leaders. Out of 73 Presidents of General Assembly sessions to date, only four have been women. Nevertheless, all is not lost. We must resolve to walk the talk and ensure that women get the same opportunities as men, in line with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.\nI assure the President of my delegation\u2019s full support. Her impeccable credentials and experience spanning more than two decades in the multilateral\n \nsetting assure us of a successful seventy-third session. It would be remiss of me not to commend her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his noteworthy leadership during the previous session. I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the work of the Organization (A/73/1), which outlines the state of our United Nations.\nWorld history has been replete, since time immemorial, with periods when peace was lacking. It speaks of conflict among brothers and sisters \u2014 wars between and within nations. Terrorism and violence have disrupted and displaced families, while economic devastation has ruined countless lives. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and tornadoes caused by climate change have taken their toll on humankind. Injustice continues to permeate countries, and societies are left devoid of hope for a prosperous, free, peaceful and just world. As new wars and civil unrest seem to be flaring up every week, our people look to us as their leaders for solutions, and they yearn for help from the United Nations.\nIt is in that context that we welcome the theme for this session \u2014 \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. The theme speaks to the very principles underpinning the formation of the Organization. The Charter of the United Nations puts people at the centre of the United Nations with the following words in its Preamble: \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d. The big question today is: have we put the people at the centre of our efforts as an Organization for more than seven decades?\nAs the session of 51 representatives who came from across the world to adopt the Charter of the United Nations in 1945 was drawing to a close, the then President of the United States, Harry Truman, said:\n\u201cThe Charter of the United Nations which you have just signed is a solid structure upon which we can build a better world    Between the victory in Europe\nand the final victory, in this most destructive of all wars, you  have  won  a  victory against war  itself.\n... With this Charter the world can begin to look forward to the time when all worthy human beings may be permitted to live decently as free people.\u201d (Proceedings of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, final plenary session, San Francisco, 1945)\nFor the past 73 years now, we have been standing at this rostrum making commitments and inspiring hope among the citizens of the world. However, our rhetoric has not been matched with action. Our lack of fidelity to the principles enshrined in the Charter remains a concern. Seven decades on, we are still embroiled in vicious conflict and violence. The world  envisioned by our forebears, where \u201cworthy human beings may  be permitted to live decently as free people\u201d (ibid.), continues to elude us. The multilateral system seems to provide no sustainable solution to the multifaceted challenges that confront our world, while unilateralism is on the rise. Those challenges put to the test the trust that humanity has put in the United Nations. Their hope that future generations will be saved from the scourge of war, which, as stated in the Preamble to the Charter, has twice in our lifetime brought untold sorrow to mankind, is further receding from sight.\nThe above scenario is a reality. Even so, the centrality and relevance of the United Nations cannot be challenged. The world would not have been the same without the United Nations. Imperfect as it is, its positive impact on the lives of  countless people is  a fact that cannot be denied. From feeding more than 104 million people in over 80 countries every year to assisting millions of refugees and protecting women and children, fighting against poverty, HIV and AIDS, and restoring calm through peacekeeping initiatives, the United Nations has undoubtedly made a difference in the lives of global citizens.\nWhen addressing the General Assembly at its seventy-second session (see A/72/PV.17), I did so with a heavy heart, as there was a dark cloud of instability and insecurity hovering over my country. But today, I stand before the Assembly to attest to the difference that the United Nations can make in people\u2019s lives. With the help of the United Nations, the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and other development partners, we are on the path to changing the trajectory of a vicious circle of instability and volatile insecurity in Lesotho. The Kingdom of Lesotho is now embarking on a comprehensive national reform agenda that will culminate in the calibration of pivotal elements of Government, and thus achieve the tenets of the National Vision 2020. Our shared commitment as a nation to transforming our mountain  kingdom into a just, prosperous and stable country, marked by effective and people-focused institutions, national\n \nunity of purpose, the rule of law, good governance and human rights, will certainly be attained.\nOur resolve to build a safe, stable and secure country is motivated by the fact that peace and security are preconditions for development. We are determined to take charge of our socioeconomic transformation  as a country, in line with the African Union Agenda 2063, as well as the  United  Nations  2030  Agenda  for Sustainable Development \u2014 premised upon the principle of inclusivity and leaving no  one  behind. We note, however, the important role that financing plays  in any attempt to achieve the goals enshrined in both Agenda 2063 and the  2030  Agenda.  While we acknowledge that official development assistance remains a catalyst for development, we also advocate for robust domestic resource mobilization. We are determined to combat illicit financial flows, strengthen tax administration and harness remittances.\nIn line with our national priorities, we are taking substantive steps towards providing an appropriate space for private-sector investment and entrepreneurship as a complement to public investments. An industrial hub has been launched in the northern region. When fully operational, it will create job opportunities for more than 14,000 people. Private property investors will also be invited to build factory shells there.\nWe also cannot ignore the disturbing issue of migration. We all know that the movement of persons across borders is an issue of staggering importance. It is our view that migration is one area where opportunities for skilled and surplus labour can be  explored.  To that end, my Government is working closely with international partners to explore development outcomes related to migration. In addition, a national consultative committee was set up to deal with a range of migration-related matters, such as the development of a strategic plan on migration and development. Included in the plan are interventions aimed at enhancing the proper utilization of remittances from the diaspora. We therefore need to embrace migrants at the global level for their contribution to the economic development of both their countries of origin and their host countries. We find it disturbing that migrants all over the world continue to face challenges of unprecedented magnitude. We call upon all parties concerned to adhere to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and we look forward to the adoption of  the compact  in December.\nPeace and prosperity cannot be achieved when women and girls are marginalized and not given the opportunity to contribute to  development.  The  role of women and other disadvantaged sectors of our communities in advancing the global development agenda must be further enhanced. It is equally important to underline that the protection of human rights is a noble objective of the international community that must not be politicized, redefined or even subjected to double standards according to the whims and caprices of a few powerful States pursuing their own agendas.\nToday on the African continent we are more determined than ever to rid ourselves of conflict by settling disputes through peaceful means. The warring parties in South Sudan have finally brokered a peace deal. The developments in the Horn of Africa offer hope for a prosperous and peaceful region. In particular, the normalization of relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea through the signing of a peace deal and the opening of embassies in both countries\u2019 capitals will usher in a new era of peace, with substantial concomitant economic, humanitarian and strategic implications for the region.\nWe continue to be saddened, however, by the situation in Western Sahara, which continues to be the only colony on the African continent. The suffering  of the Sahrawi people has been going on for far too long now. They deserve to be afforded an opportunity to voice their aspirations for independence through universal suffrage. Lesotho will continue to stand with them in their pursuit of emancipation.\nAs the plight of the Palestinian people worsens, the hope for the resolution of the crises in Syria and Iraq also diminishes. We  cannot  remain  indifferent to the suffering of those innocent people. Unilateral actions that defy international agreements and United Nations resolutions will only worsen the situation of the Palestinians. A two-State solution, with Palestine and Israel living side by side in peace and harmony, remains the only viable option for the settlement of the Palestinian question. Achieving peace is a process that requires engagement, accommodation and genuineness. Peace cannot be achieved through war or oppression. All of us joined this Organization voluntarily and professed a love for peace. Our actions must also reflect that commitment.\nIn the same vein, the economic and commercial embargo imposed on Cuba continues to weigh heavily on our conscience. There is no doubt that that measure\n \nhas had a negative impact on the people and the economy of Cuba. We call for the embargo to be lifted and for Cuba to be reintegrated into the world trading system.\nIn today\u2019s globalized world it is indefensible and incomprehensible that decisions that bind us all are left in the hands of a few Member States. Our advocacy  for the democratization of the United Nations must be intensified. Reform of the Security Council, one that takes into account the aspirations of Africa, as set out in the Ezulwini Consensus, cannot be postponed any longer. Transparency, inclusivity and democracy must inform the work of the entire United Nations system.\nIt is equally important to underscore that the gains made in the field of disarmament are being eroded gradually. Small arms and  light  weapons  continue  to flood the illegal market. The threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction  has  re-emerged,  and the United Nations is paralysed by the current size, allocation of membership and power configuration of the Security Council, making the call for the reform of that organ even more urgent.\nIn conclusion, I note that the United Nations, to a very large extent, has attempted to put people at the centre of its core business. However, still more needs to be done. I appeal to all present to shun those who seek to divide and incite us against each other. It is through our solidarity, more than anything else, that the United Nations will thrive and successfully put humankind at the centre of its activities. The United Nations is the only platform that enables us to embrace true multilateralism.\nAt the same time, let us remember that, although we may have a shared vision and leadership determined to address peace, equity and sustainability challenges, the truth is that we are mortal beings with intellectual and other constraints. As such, we need to acknowledge that there is a divine Power above, which is the source of true wisdom. Let us therefore keep our communication lines with God open in order to find real and lasting solutions to the world problems that so often besiege us.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate the President on her well-deserved election to preside over the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. Her election to that prestigious position as the fourth woman in that post in the history of the Organization and the first from Latin America is not only a unique accolade to her person, but also a testimony bestowed on her by the States Members of the United Nations. In that regard, Tanzania pledges its full support to her and her entire Office.\nI also wish to pay special tribute to her predecessor,\nHis  Excellency  Miroslav  Laj\u010d\u00e1k,  for  his  successful\nleadership and commitment to the General Assembly during his presidency at the previous session. We wish him well in his future endeavours. In the same manner, I commend Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his tireless efforts to steer the work of our Organization, especially in implementing the challenging reforms that are under way under his stewardship.\nI am greatly honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of my President, His Excellency Mr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, who could not join his colleagues in the Assembly owing to the tragic ferry accident that claimed the lives of more than 200 Tanzanians and left many others injured. We appreciate the support of the international community during this difficult moment. May the souls of the departed rest in eternal peace.\nBefore I proceed, let me express the condolences of the Government of Tanzania to the United Nations community and the entire world on  the  demise  of  Mr. Kofi Annan, an outstanding humanitarian and a defender and advocate of multilateralism. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, relatives and friends. May his soul rest in eternal peace.\nThis year\u2019s theme, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, is very captivating and timely in reinforcing global governance to ensure the implementation  of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That impetus from the United Nations comes at a time when multilateralism is eroding and needs to be rescued with collective and determined efforts.\nToday, we are living in a world where most societies are neither peaceful and equitable nor sustainable. The world is still facing many violent conflicts and wars resulting in a massive loss of lives, and the threat of terrorism, the destruction of the environment, refugee influxes, displaced persons and global migration, hunger and poverty persist in many parts of the world. Addressing those challenges requires a collective visionary leadership and governance.\nUnfortunately, all those miseries are mainly human-made and could be prevented if we resolved to take collective measures. Continued and meaningful cooperation among Member States is a  prerequisite  in addressing all of the challenges confronting the world. Through such a platform, we could accentuate the relevance of this body to all nations and the people. Furthermore, we could shape global policies and norms\n \nto respond to the various needs of our diverse cultures and societies. A call for the United Nations to be relevant to all people is therefore timely; and indeed,  it is in accordance with the Organization\u2019s purposes and principles as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nIt is in facing those global challenges that multilateralism at all levels of response, and especially through the United Nations and its institutions, becomes essential to ensuring  peaceful,  equitable and sustainable societies. It is an undeniable fact that every sovereign State in the international system seeks to maximize its national interests and the well-being of its citizens. However, acting alone and in isolation minimizes the potential for realizing the desired optimal results. Globalization and the intricate web of relations that have subsequently emerged globally render a multilateral approach to issues of national, regional and international concern essential and unavoidable.\nUnfortunately, the world is witnessing multilateral institutions and principles being put to the test. For example, the World Trade Organization, which has been the pillar and yardstick of  the  rule-based and fair global trading system, is being now undermined. Climate change and global warming, which are already wreaking havoc on lives and property in all regions regardless of national borders, can be addressed effectively only through multilateral approaches. Above all, it is the post-Second World War multilateral edifice and institutions that have given us the peace we witness today, albeit an imperfect one. We should be seeking to improve the shortcomings in the multilateral system that we have created for ourselves and for a better world, rather than walking away from it.\nTanzania is unreservedly committed to multilateralism in pursuit of its national interests. It is also through unmitigated multilateralism that we will be able to address critical global challenges, such as terrorism, extremism, radicalism, climate change, restrictive trade policies, trafficking in persons, drug abuse, pandemic diseases, absolute and abject poverty, immigration dynamics and weapons of mass destruction, just to mention a few. We are encouraged by the united chorus from the General Assembly in defence of multilateralism and in defence of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, which bind all of us together.\nWe have seen diplomatic engagement work successfully to bring adversaries to a round table to\naddress their differences peacefully. Tanzania wishes to endorse the continuous use of diplomatic means and round-table negotiations to address conflicts between and among nations. It is in that regard that Tanzania, as a peaceful and stable country, has assisted and witnessed the value of brokering peace. Tanzania welcomes the recent talks between the United States and North Korea on the Korean nuclear deal, which paved the way for the recent signing of an agreement between North Korea and the Republic of Korea. We hope that deal and others that have followed the same pattern will yield the anticipated positive outcomes sooner rather than later, including resolving the long outstanding humanitarian issues in the Korean peninsula. Those are  some  of the good examples of successful outcomes resulting from diplomatic engagements around the world. All those efforts have confirmed the value of dialogue in resolving and preventing conflicts.\nReforms are necessary both for  continuity  and for change. For the past decades, the Assembly has continuously been discussing reforms of the United Nations and its institutions so that it can respond effectively to the current global economic, political, social and changing security dynamics. That is the way to make our Organization alive and relevant. Currently, the reforms are focusing on the United Nations development system, management, and peace and security. My delegation strongly believes that the reforms will be objective and balanced.\nTanzania supports the reforms of the United Nations, especially those relating to the Security Council, and reiterates the position of Africa as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration, which we endorse. In addition, Tanzania urges the international community to make the process transparent, inclusive and democratic. All countries, poor and rich, must have equal participation, and their voices and positions must be heard and taken seriously. After many years of almost stalemated negotiations on Security Council reforms, it is necessary to move the process forward, but in a manner that will preserve the interests and positions of all parties concerned in a transparent consultative manner.\nWe ought to remind ourselves that the credibility of the United Nations rests on a fully representative and responsive Security Council. The Council is what it is today and the reforms are not advancing well because of the veto. If we are to make meaningful reforms, we should, first of all and foremost, be bold enough to\n \ndecide on the future use of the veto. In that respect,  my delegation wishes to stress that issues relating to the veto and the expansion of the membership and categories should be addressed as a package and not  in isolation.\nOver the years, and with the support of the international community and development partners, Tanzania has successfully implemented various national development plans that have significantly contributed to the reduction of poverty. Furthermore, we are proud to have incorporated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our national development agenda in order to accelerate economic growth and eradicate poverty. Drawing on experiences from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, it is apparent that the implementation of the SDGs requires adequate, sustainable and predictable funding, especially to assist least developed countries like mine. Thus, the mobilization of long-term innovative public and private financing is key to the realization of those Goals.\nTanzania has embarked on systematic legal and administrative reforms of mechanisms that have been hampering resource mobilization and accountability. The Government has embarked on a relentless fight against corruption and public-service  incompetence in order to increase accountability and transparency. The Government has undertaken stringent measures to fight drug and human trafficking, illicit trade in ivory and violent extremism. As expected, those measures have generated determined resistance on the part of vested economic  interests  and  criminal  elements. In response, the Government has needed to take appropriate countermeasures that have sometimes been misunderstood as being too restrictive. Despite those challenges, Tanzania will continue to respect the rule of law, good governance, democracy and human rights, as enshrined in our Constitution.\nNotwithstanding the ongoing efforts to mobilize domestic resources, developing countries continue to experience global systemic issues relating to unfair tax regimes and illicit financial flows, which contribute to capital flight and deny those countries their rightful income. We call upon the international community to redouble its efforts to tackle those systemic issues by, among other things, establishing an intergovernmental tax body under the United Nations to address the evasion and avoidance of taxes. That,  in  turn, will put more resources at our disposal for implementing the SDGs.\nTanzania is among the top troop-contributing countries to United Nations peacekeeping missions, and we have significantly contributed to the restoration of global peace and stability in many parts of the world. We currently have 2,687 troops serving under the United Nations flag in six different countries.\nRegrettably, Tanzania\u2019s participation in peacekeeping operations has not been without incident. Some of our peacekeepers have been attacked and even killed. The December 2017 attack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the worst in the past 25 years of United Nations peacekeeping history. We thank the Secretary- General and all Member States that extended their condolences to Tanzania and the families, friends and relatives of the deceased. Our pain was eased by those who stood with Tanzania during those difficult days. May the souls of the departed rest in eternal peace.\nWe welcome the support of the United Nations, and we commend the Secretary-General for promptly forming a special investigation team that established the causes of the attack and determined the actions to be taken to prevent such hostile and cowardly incidents in future. We are also gratified that the recommendations of the investigation report  will  feature  prominently in the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, which Tanzania supports. Tanzania looks forward to the implementation of those recommendations.\nI wish to remind the Assembly of the historic role played by Tanzania in hosting and providing sanctuary and protection to refugees from Central and Southern Africa for decades. We have done so for humanitarian reasons, but also because of the internationally agreed principles to which we are signatory with regard to the admission of asylum-seekers and the protection of refugees. We are currently hosting more than 330,000 refugees, mainly from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Over the decades of hosting refugees, Tanzania has provided local integration and citizenship to more than 150,000 refugees.\nApart from  providing  sanctuary  to  refugees,  we have also been involved in initiatives to resolve regional conflicts in the Great Lakes region, which have the potential to increase refugee  influxes into our country. In addition, as of September, Tanzania has also assisted in the voluntary repatriation of more than 46,000 Burundian refugees. The repatriation exercise was conducted transparently and inclusively\n \nin collaboration with the Burundian authorities, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other relevant development partners. Nevertheless, some misguided Burundian exiles have criticized the exercise as involuntary. The truth is that the bottlenecks and constraints in the implementation of the Tripartite Agreement are due to a lack of resources and to mixed progress in the political and security situation in Burundi.\nIn that connection, Tanzania appeals to the international community to facilitate  and  support the ongoing voluntary repatriation of the remaining Burundian refugees while consultations continue between Tanzania, Burundi and the UNHCR. It is equally important to present a realistic assessment of the evolving political and security situation inside Burundi in order to enable the refugees to make informed and objective decisions on returning to various  parts of the country.\nThe people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continue to face challenges to peace, security and stability. The country has continuously been destabilized by warring factions and warlords, who have wreaked havoc, leading to political instability in some parts of the country, especially in the eastern part of the country. The situation has not only denied the Democratic Republic of the Congo the opportunity to develop its country and people, but has also undermined and threatened regional peace and security. However, current efforts to address the protracted impasse are seeing some progress with regard to the Government\u2019s commitment to holding the long-awaited general elections later this year. The stability of the Democratic Republic of the Congo would not only contribute to addressing the refugee problem, but would also improve the prospects for regional trade and investment, as well as the economic prosperity of the region. There can be no better assurance of the future, progress in and status of the political situation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo than the statement delivered two days ago from this rostrum by President Joseph Kabila Kabange (see A/73/PV.7). To that end, it is necessary to continue with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and the Intervention Brigade, in which Tanzania is a participant, in the eastern part of the country, until the elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are concluded.\nIn 2015, many world leaders who had gathered here welcomed the historic and momentous decision taken by the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba to restore diplomatic relations. For most of us, that was the beginning of a harmonious coexistence with high hopes and expectations. However, as time has progressed, we feel and see that minimum efforts have been made to meet such hopes and expectations, which ultimately should lead to the lifting the embargo that has condemned the people of Cuba for many years. We hope that through the power of reason and the diplomatic means that led to the re-establishment of ties, the embargo on Cuba will be totally lifted and that a new dawn of cooperation will follow, not only between the two countries but in the entire region of Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe issue of self-determination for Western Sahara has taken a new direction with Morocco re-joining the African Union (AU), where it is a member of the Peace and Security Council. There is a renewed opportunity for the United Nations and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to work with the newly established AU troika mechanism on Western Sahara to address the issue of that area. Tanzania supports that initiative and hopes that the process will gather momentum and reach a new status soon.\nOn the question of Palestine, Tanzania reiterates its position on resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine through the two-State solution. We believe that Palestine has the right to enjoy its independence and peace, just as Israel is entitled to peace and security, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. It is our belief that it is within the creative and resourceful ability of Israel and the determination of the Palestinian people to reach a peaceful solution that will permit Israel and Palestine to coexist in peace and security.\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Tanzania\u2019s commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and to multilateralism. The Government of His Excellency John Magufuli stands ready to participate constructively in the search for peaceful solutions to conflicts and to contribute to the United Nations mandate for conflict prevention and  peacekeeping.  Above  all,  we  look  to this Organization to continue championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and to support Tanzania\u2019s own efforts to achieve those Goals as it heads towards a middle-income designation and furthers its ambition of industrialization.\n \nMay God bless us all and may God bless the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Bula, and a very good day to all. Allow me to congratulate the President on her assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nEvery year brings fresh challenges and new crises, even as the crises of last year and the year before await some resolution, or even some respite.\n \nThis Organization, the United Nations, is continually challenged to stand between parties in conflict, ease the suffering of refugees and migrants and continue its work to build a more peaceful, just and equal world. The Fijian people have always been proud of our nation\u2019s full engagement with the United Nations. We have been a willing and energetic presence in peacekeeping efforts around the world, and we are now proudly putting every ounce of energy that we have into the fight to save this planet and its people \u2014 all of us \u2014 from a catastrophic warming of our climate.\nFiji will  soon celebrate  national  elections  for the second time since our return to democracy. I say \u201ccelebrate\u201d with a purpose, because truly free elections are the very starting point for democracy and freedom. If the people cannot choose their Government freely, their other freedoms are always in jeopardy.\nI am proud of what we have accomplished in our Fijian democracy. The shell of democracy that once existed has now been pierced, bringing the Fijian people into a genuinely inclusive society in which minority rights are respected and all citizens are equal, in name and in fact. That is the great promise of the 2013 Fijian Constitution, which has been the beacon for our progress through its vast array of political and socioeconomic protections for every Fijian.\nToday and forever, in Fiji we make and will make no distinctions based on ethnicity, social status or religion, and we enforce and will enforce our laws guaranteeing equality. We have reinforced our democracy by passing laws to empower girls and women and protect them from violence. We have reformed our education system so that it provides real opportunities for all Fijians, regardless of income, gender or whether they live in the capital or on the most remote islands.\nThis year we achieved a literacy level of over 90 per cent. More than 90 per cent of girls in Fiji complete 15 years of secondary education and just under 90 per cent of our boys do the same. We are building our future on that firm foundation of education.\nWe have also reformed our welfare programmes not only to provide a stronger safety net but also to create greater opportunities for the most vulnerable in our society. While we provide free medicines and subsidized electricity, we also award grants to micro-businesses as a way of lifting people out of poverty and rewarding and encouraging self-reliance and entrepreneurship.\nThat approach goes beyond mere Government programmes for the disadvantaged. It is based on the fundamental principle that the socioeconomic rights of all Fijians must be protected. They include the right to a high-quality education, the right to receive treatment and medication when our people are ill, the right to decent housing, the right to clean water and electricity, and the right to affordable and accessible transportation.\nWe have also strengthened our independent institutions \u2014 our judiciary and the independent commissions that protect consumers, fight corruption, provide legal assistance, advocate and promote human rights and carry out many Government activities that must be free of political considerations. I may be disappointed when my Government loses a case in court, but those defeats are signs of strong, independent institutions, which we must support and reinforce. They serve to strengthen the people\u2019s belief that everyone in Fiji can get justice. If people believe in the courts, they will go to the courts to settle their disputes and trust the courts to adjudicate without fear or favour.\nThere is no doubt that the Fijian people have a strong and abiding love for freedom. We want to live freely, and we see freedom, democracy and, perhaps most important of all, tolerance as powerful forces for peace in the world. It is with that clearly demonstrated vocation for personal freedom, tolerance and social justice that Fiji is running as a candidate for membership in the Human Rights Council during this session of the General Assembly. We have thought hard about human rights and have taken actions to be a better nation \u2014 a nation that encourages respect for the dignity of every person. We look forward to bringing that point of view to the critical work of the Council.\nFiji looks to a future free of racism, nepotism and privilege, a future where the rights of all persons are guaranteed and enforced by a robust constitutional framework that reaffirms and protects civil and political rights, as well as social, cultural and economic rights.\nOur value to the Human Rights Council is also underpinned by our long experience in peacekeeping. It was exactly 40 years ago that Fiji first participated in United Nations peacekeeping. Over those 40 years, which have seen Fijians serving in Africa, the Sinai, East Timor and throughout the Middle East, we have come to identify ourselves as a peacekeeping nation, which makes us proud. That is something that we offer to the global community and our fellow human beings.\n \nMoreover, over those 40 years we have witnessed at first hand the way intolerance embraces and leads  to repression, violence and mass migration. We have experienced intolerance in Fiji, which was an ugly experience that corroded our trust in each other and our sense of who we are as a people. We must remember that experience so that we do not repeat it, and we will never stop working to ensure that it stays in our past.\nI am proud to stand before the Assembly and report that Fiji is in its ninth year of strong economic growth. I believe that that is due in no small part to  the democratization that has taken root in our country and is flourishing. Democracy is  based  on  a  belief in the people and the belief that everyone is capable   of great things if they are given equal opportunity. When people see that they have opportunities, can obtain justice, speak their minds and be heard, and that their hard work will be rewarded, they invest their money and their sweat in their future and in greater possibilities for their children. They stay at home and contribute rather than emigrating, and they feel free to let their hopes and ambitions soar. That is what drives a thriving economy.\nHowever, that optimism must be nurtured and supported through intelligent Government action. In Fiji we have reformed the tax laws to make them simpler and more just. In that connection, we have begun to rigorously enforce our tax laws to ease the burden on those who have little and to ensure that whoever should pay pays a fair share. People who take risks and mount successful businesses should enjoy the fruits of their hard work, but they must also do their part to sustain the nation. Tax cheating is an offence against the people, and we will root it out and penalize it wherever it exists.\nWe have also reformed our State enterprises to make them profitable and efficient. The  people  of  Fiji and the employees of those companies have been the main beneficiaries, because better capitalization and better management has produced better services, increased investments and higher wages.\nWe also see small and medium-sized enterprises as important ways of promoting growth and lifting people out of poverty. I am proud to say that my Government has given grants worth $32.4 million to small and micro-enterprises, and we have been rewarded with explosive growth and extraordinary innovation in that sector. Free people need an economic structure that\nserves them and makes them optimistic. That is one of the basic pillars of democracy.\nFiji is coming to the end of its presidency of the twenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-23), part of the United Nations ongoing climate negotiations among the nations of the world, but the struggle to fight global warming and end the degradation of our oceans will continue to be Fiji\u2019s highest priority. The many disastrous effects of climate change that we are seeing in the South Pacific and around the world are well documented. The same can be said of the enormous stresses on our oceans arising from acidification, overfishing, warming and plastic refuse. The time to debate those facts is long past.\nAs the Fijian Prime Minister, I have met thousands of Fijian women, men and children every year who have suffered from the latest wave of climate-related impacts, such as cyclones, flooding, prolonged droughts and steadily rising seas. I have met with farmers whose crops have been washed away, teachers and students who have lost their schools, and families whose homes have been destroyed. They want their Prime Minister to demand that the world take action on their behalf.\nThe commitments that we have all made through our nationally determined contributions fall woefully short of the mark. They simply will not get us to the goal agreed in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, that of reducing the rate of global warming to well below the 2\u00b0C target, let alone the more ambitious target of 1.5\u00b0C. What matters now is action. Fiji will press for more action on climate change and ocean health in every forum that it is a part of. We cannot simply wait for the rest of the world to come around, because the effects of climate change are already bearing down on us.\nWe are already taking steps to boost our resilience. Fiji has begun a project to improve access to sustainable water supplies and sewerage services for approximately 270,000 Fijians. We will provide cyclone insurance coverage for low-income households. We are relocating entire villages and communities to escape the rising seas. Following the cyclones, we are rebuilding our infrastructure to a higher and far more resilient standard. We are working to protect communities that face unacceptably high risks of flooding. Fiji also became the first emerging market to issue a sovereign green bond to fund such activities.\n \nHowever, no Government can combat climate change alone. The challenge is simply too great. That is why, from the beginning of Fiji\u2019s presidency of COP-23, I have sought to build a grand coalition of Governments, the private sector, labour forces, religious groups and civil society to take initiatives and come up with ideas and solutions, both great and small.\nI am confident that I speak for all Fijians and Pacific islanders when I say that I tend to lose patience with national leaders who proclaim their deep concern over climate change and then do little or nothing to lead their nations onto a more ambitious path for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Leaders who ignore that threat and give their people new coal-fired power plants instead of a better future for their children are either tragically short-sighted or simply engaging in a most cynical form of betrayal. And their people \u2014 all people \u2014 will bear the burden.\nThe world has embraced the Pacific tradition of talanoa, a tradition of open and honest dialogue. That will help to raise our collective ambition. But ambition without action and without a plan is just talk. The Talanoa Dialogue will reach a crescendo in Katowice, Poland, at COP-24. We cannot let Katowice fail. Katowice must not became another Copenhagen.\nWe are not only calling on others to act, we are also leading from the front. Earlier this week I announced that Fiji will commit to significantly raising its nationally determined contribution. Fiji will be a net- zero greenhouse-gas-emission country by 2050. Fiji is proud to have launched the Ocean Pathway Partnership with the Government of Sweden. We know that the interaction of ocean ecology and climate change runs deep. We cannot attempt to solve the crisis of one without confronting the crisis of the other. Our oceans are suffering from the stress of human activities, which goes beyond climate change and includes pollution, overfishing and acidification.\nI want to draw the world\u2019s serious attention to the need to help developing nations, particularly the most disadvantaged and vulnerable, to overcome climate and oceans stresses. We need access to finance and practical solutions, and we need the United Nations to help us get there. It has been an honour for Fiji,  and for me personally, to lead the United Nations efforts on climate change this year. I am proud of what we have accomplished. The world has never needed the United Nations more. The existential problem of climate\nchange requires us to work together, the challenge of mobilizing finance for climate resilience requires us to work together, and more complex and more globalized conflicts require us to work together.\nFiji is firmly committed to the United Nations. We need the United Nations to be at its best if we are to have any chance of overcoming the grave challenges that Fiji and the world now confront.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased today to address the General Assembly on behalf of my Prime Minister, His Excellency Mr. Peter Paire O\u2019Neill, and the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea.\nI congratulate you, Madam President, and the people of Ecuador on your election as the first woman leader from the Latin American and the Caribbean region to preside over the General Assembly. You can count on Papua New Guinea as a partner committed  to supporting your work during your presidency. I would also like to thank the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his excellent work in the past year. It is also important to commend the leadership of the Secretary-General for the reform of the United Nations and its systems, the United Nations being an organization that is so fundamental to the peace, prosperity and security of the world.\nThis is an exciting year for Papua New Guinea because, throughout 2018, we are hosting the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. In so doing, our country is emerging on the global stage as never before.\nLocated in the Pacific Ocean, we are part of  a vast blue continent of island nations linked by sea. We also border with South-East Asia and are within sight of Australia. We have more than 8 million people, the biggest economy and the largest land mass of the Pacific island countries. We are joining with our Pacific sisters and brothers in a mighty regional endeavour to protect the ocean and its bounty and to  bring prosperity to our peoples.\nNations near and far are learning that our country, Papua New Guinea, is a great treasury of riches. We have the third-largest rainforest in the world, after Brazil and the Congo. We are guardians of a third of the global supply of tuna, the fish that feeds the world. Our land is home to vast storehouses of gold, silver, nickel, oil and gas.\nWe are one people forged together from more than 1,000 tribes. With more than 800 distinct languages, we are the most linguistically diverse nation on Earth. Like all developing countries, we have issues to face, but we do not let them daunt us as we strive for progress and prosperity.\nThis year, we are taking a giant stride as we host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The APEC economies encompass 39 per cent of the world\u2019s\n \npopulation and 48 per cent of the world\u2019s trade. Among the participants in the forum are the United States, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan and other significant economies. APEC itself is, in many ways, a regional example of attempts to achieve what States Members of the United Nations are working so hard to accomplish.\nMany issues are on the table  either  formally or  in informal meetings on the sidelines, namely, first, prosperity through free trade, which is the founding rationale for the APEC-plus approach; secondly, cleaning up and protecting the natural environment; thirdly, inclusiveness, so that none of our precious human beings are left behind; fourthly, embracing the digital economy; and, fifthly and very importantly, gender equality.\nInternational trade is an important engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty eradication,  as well as a critical source for financing development and achieving sustainable development. As the  host  of APEC, we  have  opportunities  like  never  before. It is the largest international event in our country\u2019s history. We are well prepared for the leaders summit in mid-November. The world will see the stunning APEC House, an outstanding architectural creation inspired by our local culture. We thank the APEC economies for their material and organizational support, including, in particular, Australia, Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, the United States of America and many others that are  too numerous to mention. To add to the Pacific island flavour of the event, we have invited all Pacific island leaders to come to our country during this time.\nThrough APEC, we have opportunities to attract trade and foreign direct investment. It will continue to provide us with access to knowledge and to a dialogue with APEC economic leaders, who will be in attendance. Such capacity-building support in our country will lead directly to business growth and the creation of more jobs for our people. However, given our small and open economy, which is subject to external forces, we join all other members of the international community in promoting respect for and the strengthening of the rules-based, international multilateral trading system.\nHosting the APEC event is a  huge challenge for   a developing country such as ours, and people can sometimes paralyse themselves by focusing only on their perceived shortfalls or problems. But we in Papua\nNew  Guinea decided  to  try it.  That  perspective also\napplies to our view of the United Nations and its work.\nOf course, we must acknowledge and work to eliminate the great problems confronting us today. However, in doing so, let  us  all  keep  our  eyes  on the prize: our vision of peace, security, a return to a pristine environment and ongoing prosperity.  The key  to overcoming the varied challenges lies within  us \u2014 we the peoples of the United Nations. Let us work on being united and being stronger together in a system based on mutual respect, friendship, dialogue and multilateralism. Unity, of course, is the answer. It is the greatest strength on the planet.\nTwo weeks ago, Papua New Guinea celebrated its forty-third anniversary of independence as an unbroken democracy. We continue to consolidate our economic and structural reforms, supported by responsible monetary and fiscal policies aimed at having a balanced budget. With recovering oil and gas prices and several well-advanced new major energy and mining projects, we are optimistic about our future economic outlook.\nThe 2030 Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development is a solid pathway that holds great promise for the international community. The choice to enjoy its full potential lies in our hands. At the Pacific regional level, earlier this month, in Nauru, our forum leaders reaffirmed our collective commitment. The call for collective action is  set  out  in  the  Boe  Declaration, a copy of which was delivered to His Excellency the Secretary-General yesterday. At the national level, we recognize the importance of putting in place the basic building blocks needed to enable sustainable, inclusive and participatory development. Both Australia and New Zealand, which are our good friends, have eloquently addressed the General Assembly on issues facing our region and the world and on the requirements and obligations for collective action.\nAn essential part of our  development  challenge  is harnessing the vastly untapped potential of our increasing population of young people, which today constitutes approximately 60 per cent of our total population. Creating employment opportunities in both the formal and the informal sectors is a key priority in our efforts to address the needs of young people in our country. We have hopes for the transformative nature of the digital economy, which is truly a game-changer.\nIn addition, one  of  our greatest  challenges  is  to\nprotect women and girls and to ensure that they have\n \nfull equality in our society. We believe that women\u2019s equality is a fundamental human right. We have a very long way to go in that area. However, we are determined to find ways to make progress towards achieving that objective, for the sake of women and girls themselves and for the good of the nation. In fact, our long-term advancement depends on making great strides in what we believe is a very crucial area.\nWe are working hard to do that through policies and laws, combating gender-based violence, providing business opportunities in the formal and informal sectors, such as microcredit schemes, and investing in our girls\u2019 and women\u2019s education at all levels of our education system. The changes are noticeable in my country, as we have put an additional 1 million young people in schools, many of whom are girls. We of course express our gratitude for the support of our multilateral and bilateral development partners, including the United Nations system, in assisting us in more ways than one in achieving our goals.\nWe are preparing our people to cope with the increasing dangers arising from climate change, which are very real for us. Earlier this month, as I have said, at the Pacific Island Forum leaders meeting, in Nauru, we reaffirmed our strong commitment to working together to combat the adverse impacts of climate change under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement and other frameworks for the resilient development of the Pacific region. The Boe Declaration of the Pacific Island Forum leaders makes our position clear. We  therefore  strongly  welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s climate summit to be held in September 2019.\nIn February, Papua New Guinea experienced a tragic and unprecedented earthquake, the worst in our history. It hit five provinces, killed nearly 200 people and displaced nearly 600,000 others. Many others were injured and traumatized. Vital infrastructure was destroyed. The national economy slowed. Compounding our situation were two separate volcanic eruptions.\nWe are not alone. Accordingly, we sympathize with other countries, such as Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, China, the United States of America, the countries of the Caribbean and others that have been affected in recent times by months of natural disasters and climate-change-induced challenges. We express our gratitude to our bilateral partners, including the United Nations system, Australia, New Zealand, China,\nJapan and others, as well as the private sector and civil\n-society groups, which stood with us in our time of need. We are now revamping our economy and disaster- related plans to address similar events that may occur in the future.\nWe naturally welcome the efforts made to replenish the financing available through the Green Climate Fund and thank the contributors for their generosity. Improved and timely access is imperative, especially for small island developing countries such as ours, in order to benefit from that important support to help us to mitigate, adapt and build resilience to the ravages of climate change and its adverse impacts and natural disasters. Again, this is a call for collective global action that all small island developing States will benefit from and seek accordingly.\nOur Government notes the international community\u2019s increasing interest in the imminent referendum in June 2019 in Papua New Guinea\u2019s Autonomous Region of Bougainville under the Bougainville Peace Agreement. We are fully committed to the Agreement. This year, we appointed the former Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr. Bertie Ahern, to preside over the work of the Bougainville Referendum Commission. We are eager for the Commission to begin its mandate soon. We  are  again  grateful  to  our multilateral and bilateral development partners, including the United Nations, for working together with us on this issue of national importance for my country. However, we want to emphasize that the work done through partnerships should in no way undermine the sovereignty of Papua New Guinea over its territory, in accordance with international law.\nWe welcome the easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula, commend the efforts made by all parties involved, and further encourage peaceful dialogue. We support the moves to keep sanctions in place, not as a punishment but as a real incentive to get rid of nuclear weapons and fully implement all Security Council resolutions in order to bring prosperity to the people of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nAccordingly, we applaud and support the efforts of the President of the General Assembly to draw global attention to the dangers of weapons of mass destruction. For our part, we are working towards signing the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nLet me take this opportunity to share the current status of the refugees and migrants on our Manus\n \nIsland with the General Assembly. The processing centre was officially closed  by  my  Government  on 31 October 2017, following the decision of the Supreme Court in April 2016. We are therefore working closely with Australia in resettling qualified asylum-seekers, including in the United States. Other migrants remain in our country, each of whom will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. That is our contribution, within the limit of our means, in partnership with Australia, to addressing human trafficking, people-smuggling and international crime.\nAs a maritime nation, Papua New Guinea considers the oceans agenda to be of great importance, as it contributes significantly to our nation\u2019s well-being. We are working to ensure equitable returns from our marine resources, particularly by combating illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing in Papua New Guinea\u2019s territorial waters. We are grateful for the close cooperation of like-minded countries in the World Trade Organization that are working to address harmful fisheries subsidies that foster IUU fishing. At the Pacific Islands Forum meeting, under our \u201cBlue Pacific Continent\u201d theme, we have agreed to secure the region\u2019s maritime boundaries, work to eliminate marine litter and enhance maritime surveillance so as to deter illicit activities.\nIn conclusion, I want to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention once again to our country as we prepare to host the APEC leaders summit in November. As the world increasingly turns its attention to the Pacific Ocean, we are witnessing the enhanced interest of a range of countries, such as Australia, China, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. As one of the nations of the Blue Pacific Continent, we welcome that interest. However, we urge everyone to play an appropriate role in accordance with the accepted rules of international order so that the blue Pacific Ocean will be a zone of cooperation, stability and security, and an environment of pristine beauty for future prosperity.\nI would therefore like to conclude by expressing the fervent hope of all our peoples that the Pacific Ocean forever lives up to the meaning of its name \u2014 the ocean of peace.\n"

        "file_text": "It takes decades to build peace and trust, but it only takes seconds, one selfish or narrow-minded decision, to break them. We gather here every year to enhance what we have been building for over 70 years: an idea of a world based on  rules and the principles of humanity, responsibility, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, where wars and armed conflicts have no place, where disputes are solved in dialogue and where challenges are addressed through cooperation.\nWe are continuously becoming wealthier and more advanced. With all the resources we can generate together, we might have the means  necessary  to reach even the poorest of the poor. Yet we are more often driven by selfishness and short-term interests. Instead of enlarging freedom, cooperation and healthy competition, we introduce restrictions  and  trade wars. While globalization has created unprecedented wealth, inequalities still divide our planet. Economic figures are positive but, in many parts of our world, have hardly translated into improved well-being and dignity for every human being. At an amazing pace, we continue to develop technologies allowing us to connect, communicate and be closer globally. But the distance between people and the gap in understanding and empathy towards other cultures remains huge. Yet, thanks to innovation, the world has never been smaller. What happens thousands of kilometres away can turn into a global problem in a matter of minutes, and global problems have a direct impacts on our citizens. Against that backdrop, the United Nations plays an irreplaceable role. It has enormous potential to overcome those paradoxes. Its strong principles, responsible action and ability to drive cooperation are what make it so unique. Let me touch upon those aspects in more detail.\nRules and principles and their enforcement must remain the backbone of the Organization because today\n \nit seems that playing by the rules has become old- fashioned, as if ignoring them were a sign of strength and respect a sign of weakness.\nThe number of armed conflicts has increased in recent years. In only 2016 and 2017, the number of conflicts equalled the peak of the Cold War era. The number of civilian casualties rise. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of innocent people directly affected by conflicts and war.\nSovereignty and territorial integrity are the DNA of global and regional stability and security. But the occupation of Georgia and Ukraine and destabilization in the region are just one of many examples of respect for rules being replaced by ruthless power politics.\nThe threat of nuclear weapons resonates much more often than we could have imagined in the recent years. We hope that the developments under way in North Korea will bring about tangible results. We must make sure that agreements will be kept. And if not, we need to act with resolve.\nToo often we see thousands of civilians massacred by their very regimes, or in endless conflicts, as if we had become unmoved by the breaching of the very norms of humanity and stopped counting the innocent lives lost in Syria, Yemen, Palestine, Myanmar, South Sudan and elsewhere.\nTogether we have agreed that the use of weapons of mass destruction is unacceptable, without exception. Any use of chemical weapons must be a red line and not tolerated \u2014 an automatic trigger for resolute action. It is therefore shameful to see the tyrannical regime in Syria repeatedly use chemical weapons against its own citizens for the sake of survival. As for us, Europeans, it is shocking to witness the attacks in Salisbury, Great Britain, with the perpetrators avoiding responsibility and shamelessly denying the facts.\nIt is our responsibility to make sure that no perpetrator escapes unpunished. We must  firmly show that we will not allow our principles to be bent  to aggressive politics, that we will not undermine the authority of this Organization by inaction.\nWe all have a great responsibility towards our citizens, the international community and the planet to lead, to stand firmly behind our values and to defend them. We must listen to our people not only to address their problems, but also to see far enough to inspire them, in particular vis-\u00e0-vis extremism, populism,\nradicalism, xenophobia, racism, propaganda, lies, the twisting of the truth, and terrorism. Their goals are simple and yet effective: to spread fear, hatred and doubt, erode our beliefs and values and undermine our unity. They provide seemingly quick and simple solutions, provoking confrontation and drawing dividing lines.  It is no surprise they find fertile soil everywhere we fail to deliver. People living in poverty, afflicted by hunger or disease, with no access to education or health care are among their natural targets. And we will not win this fight if we do not offer those people and their children hope for a better life of dignity, free of fear of hunger or death. That is why our unity in implementing the development goals, in fighting climate change and addressing migration is so important. We need to turn our plans and our promises into a global reality. Failing to do so only sends a signal of our weakness, leaving those people and this planet as easy prey.\nThe unprecedented progress and innovation of new technology brings with it new challenges. I am very concerned about malicious activities in cyberspace. Growing manipulation through social media is undermining democracy worldwide and indoctrinating our populations. Cyberspace knows no borders. It is anonymous and provides  unlimited  room  to  strike  at us. The choice of means is endless: to manipulate elections, to influence decisions, to spy on us or sneak into our computers, networks and  everyday lives.  It  is as dangerous as any conventional threat. As such   it requires our utmost attention. But, to date, we have done nothing or little about it. Global companies prefer their profits over their responsibilities. It is therefore up to us, States, to set new standards and, where needed, regulations \u2014 because today we do not lead, we only follow. And the price of inaction may soon be very high.\nToo often, we hear political leaders issue calls to fight extremism and propaganda with the same tools and rhetoric. They could not be more wrong. The only honest answer is to support tolerance, freedom of speech and critical thinking in our societies. The only potent defence is to strengthen our values and to bring candid solutions to people\u2019s problems. Only when we deliver may our democratic ideology become immune to extremist ideas and propaganda. In that effort, we need to remember that free media are our allies, not our enemies. They are guardians of our principles. They are often the first to spot when things go in\n \nthe wrong direction. They hold those who break the rules accountable.\nWe should therefore be worried indeed about increased attacks on journalists, attempts to eliminate the freedom of the press, and growing restrictions on civil societies. Sadly, last year dozens of journalists were killed, hundreds imprisoned and thousands oppressed. The climate of hate continues to spread, portraying them as enemies of the State, enemies of nations or even of faiths. But they play a key role in  our mission for a better world, and as such they must be protected.\nNone of our countries, even the most powerful, is big enough to face present challenges on its own, be they migration, terrorism, climate change or sustaining solid economic growth. While our most important duty as politicians is to serve our people, that will be possible only if we truly understand the value of cooperation and that, if we truly want to change the world for the better, we need to think of others \u2014 individuals, nations and countries \u2014 and patiently explain this principle to our people.\nAs Kofi Annan said,\n\u201cMore than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations\u201d.\nI admit that multilateralism is not always easy,  but  it is the only sustainable way. The United Nations will serve its purpose as long as we, the Member States, hold true to our commitments and stand ready to defend rules and principles. The noble ideals and strong principles of this Organization \u2014 the steadfast values of tolerance, empathy, compassion and solidarity \u2014 are our best tools for facing any challenge. If we protect those values, the  moral  compass  of  humankind, then the evil of aggressive power politics, selfish nationalism, extremism and racism will not prevail. We may not know what comes tomorrow, but we know how to respond if we let the moral compass guide us. The best assurance we can have in times of uncertainty is to protect our values.\nI wish to conclude by congratulating the President of the General Assembly on assuming her duties. The challenges I spoke about are not easy to tackle, but I have full confidence that the United Nations and her Office will guide the Assembly through these times\nwith the utmost dedication to fulfilling our common goals. I therefore also wish proudly to thank and congratulate her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for the professionalism with which he served the United Nations and its peoples."

        "file_text": "I bring a message of peace from the people of Nicaragua and from President and Commander Daniel Ortega and Vice-President Rosario Murillo.\nSince the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development three years ago, we have continued to witness a world in crisis, the result of unbridled capitalism, interference in the affairs of others and the violation of international law and the sovereignty of our peoples through the use of  force, as well as attempts at coups d\u2019\u00e9tat and destabilization efforts that threaten our prospects for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the 2030 Agenda. Nicaragua has resisted attempts at regime change. Our country has once again prevailed and achieved peace, fraternal coexistence and a gradual return to normal daily life. The attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that we overcame in Nicaragua was the result of such interventionism, and its legacy has entailed grave consequences for us, including economic damage, death, destruction and terrorism disguised as peaceful protest, characterized by the savage killing of citizens and policemen, the setting on fire of public and private property, assaults, rights violations, extortion, torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.\nIn the region, Nicaragua  is  widely  recognized  as an agent of regional stability, peace and security with its exemplary benchmark achievements in economic, political and social development, poverty reduction, gender equality and public security, all\n \nof which are included in the State policies that we continue to develop and that insulate our country from international organized crime, local and transnational gangs, terrorism and narcoactivity. The Government and the people of  Nicaragua  are  staunch  defenders of the principles of independence and sovereignty, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We therefore demand that an end be put to all interventionist policies, which violate international law, including interventionist activities in Nicaragua and brotherly nations of the Americas and the world.\nThe Government and the people of  Nicaragua have worked persistently to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. As of April our country recorded sustained annual growth of approximately 4.7 per cent. Our socioeconomic  projects  and  programmes to eradicate overall poverty at the national level have succeeded in decreasing poverty from 42.5  per cent in 2009 to 24.9 per cent in 2016. Extreme poverty decreased from 14.6 per cent in 2009 to 6.9  per cent in 2016. Today,  we  are once again facing the threat of the United States, which seeks to halt the social, economic and cultural development of our people. We condemn such interventionism, which is manifested in the introduction of a law in the United States Congress requiring international financial institutions to refuse to issue loans to Nicaragua.\nFor Nicaragua, contributing to international peace is synonymous with achieving general and complete nuclear disarmament. We have therefore signed and ratified the recent Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and call on countries to ratify that historic Treaty. The Government of the Republic of Nicaragua has supported the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, based on dialogue and communication between the authorities of both parties. We welcome the rapprochement between the two Koreas and the holding of the third inter-Korean summit, as well as the Joint Declaration that the two Korean leaders agreed on in September in Pyongyang and which is seen as a great stride forward in alleviating tensions and meaningfully obviating the danger of war on the entire peninsula. The Government of the Republic of Nicaragua hopes that nuclear weapons will be dismantled in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and that the countries involved will cooperate and consequently ensure firm and lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.\nThe Government of Nicaragua supports nuclear negotiations  between  the  Islamic  Republic  of   Iran\nand the E3/EU+3, that is China,  France,  Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, along with the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, which resulted in the finalization of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 14 July 2015. We stress that that agreement demonstrates that dialogue and diplomacy are the most appropriate means for solving such problems and are the essential components that enable multilateralism to work.\nNicaragua condemns the criminal blockade against the sisterly Republic of Cuba and all of the associated extraterritorial measures and ramifications. Nicaragua rejects all coercive economic measures that seek to bend the will and spirit of freedom and sovereignty of peoples and Governments. Our country finds the use of unilateral coercive economic measures to be a political and selective instrument aimed at trying to illegally change Governments, and it is therefore unacceptable. This year we will once again vote against the unjust blockade imposed by the United States. Our sisterly Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Bolivarian People and the legitimate Government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros can count on our unconditional solidarity. We have condemned the assassination attempt against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros and the threat of military intervention against the Bolivarian people and Republic of Venezuela.\nWe must continue to promote decolonization in the world, and we therefore support the Palestinian, Sahrawi and Puerto Rican peoples and the Argentine Malvinas Islands. Nicaragua advocates for the two- State solution, that is, the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital, within the 1967 borders, living in peace and harmony. We reiterate our complete solidarity with the Government and the people of Syria in their struggle against international terrorism and in defence of their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nHumankind continues to seek peace. Seventy- three years after its founding, the Organization has  not yet managed to fully meet the goals set out with regard to peace. Given such a regrettable state of affairs, the call for reinventing the  United  Nations, as former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua, Father Miguel D\u2019Escoto Brockmann, proposed during his presidency of the General Assembly (see A/63/ PV.1), is more urgent than ever. To that end, we must promote the transformation needed to ensure that the\n \nOrganization serves the interests of every one of its Members and all of humankind. We underscore that  at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly in 2008, during his presidency, the late Father Miguel D\u2019Escoto Brockmann, whom we fittingly referred to as the Chancellor of Dignity of Nicaragua, planned and fought, with those ideas in mind, wishing  to fulfil Nicaragua\u2019s mandate to lay the groundwork for discussions on such a transformation, by  introducing a proposal for a \u201cuniversal declaration of the common good of the Earth and humanity\u201d (A/63/PV.105, p.32), as the first indispensable step towards reinventing the United Nations.\nWe need urgent  action  to  combat climate change. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities remains in force, and those primarily responsible for the largest volume of the emissions, destruction, degradation and imbalances in nature must recognize the losses and damages suffered by the rest of us and help with the recovery of Mother Earth and the peoples of the world. In order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, we need to repeal the unilateral and coercive measures that are impeding our countries\u2019 development programmes and which are in violation of international law. We must work to achieve justice, peace, respect, dialogue and sovereign security in the world. To that end, we must encourage making the changes necessary so that the Organization can serve the interests of all its Members.\nOur Government  and  our  people  advocate  for  a world with values, a world in which we, as human beings, can rely on what is best within us to foster the best possible conditions for creating fair, sustainable, equitable, secure and sovereign  development  based on full access and sharing by every man and woman  of  scientific  and  technological   advances   relating to all aspects of our  lives.  We  once  again  entreat the international community and hope that, at this seventy-third session of the General Assembly, the commitment that we are undertaking will result in an open process marked by profound reflection aimed at achieving the required transformation for reinventing and democratizing the United Nations.\nIn conclusion, we stress our commitment to continuing to fight for peace \u2014 a priority for the world and our people \u2014 and to ensuring that conflicts arising in various parts of the world can be overcome through dialogue and negotiations and that, above all, peoples and countries can be free of fear from the use or threat\nof the use of force, a threat that the great Powers seek to impose on States that are small in population. In fact, they may be small in terms of development, but they are great in terms of their values and history."

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, and to express my appreciation for the efforts of Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, the President of the previous session.\nI also commend the President on her choice of theme for this year\u2019s session, for as  Member  States we desperately need to renew our commitment and contributions to reinforcing the role  and  status  of  the United Nations as the basic foundation of a just and effective international order, based on a balance  of interests and responsibilities, respect for State sovereignty and the dissemination of a culture of peace, as well as in enabling us to rise above racism, extremism and violence while achieving sustainable development. Those are the values that have shaped\nEgypt\u2019s vision in relation to the United Nations since we co-founded it seven decades ago, and throughout the six terms that Egypt has served on the Security Council, the latest of which was in 2016 and 2017. Those values are also the driving force behind Egypt\u2019s active contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations, which makes us the world\u2019s seventh-largest troop-contributing country.\nDespite that strong belief in the values and role of the United Nations, we have to admit in all frankness that there is a flaw in the international system that has a negative effect on its performance and casts a shadow over its credibility for many peoples, particularly in the Arab and African regions, at the heart of which Egypt is situated. How can we blame Arabs who question the credibility of  the  United  Nations  and the values it represents at a time when their region is threatened by the disintegration and collapse of nation States, giving way to a wave of terrorism as well as to religious and sectarian conflicts that deplete the Arab peoples\u2019 resources? How can we blame Arabs who wonder why the Palestinian people have been denied their legitimate rights to live in dignity and peace in an independent State that reflects their national identity, hopes and aspirations?\nCan we say that Africans are exaggerating when they complain about the ineffectiveness of the world order and about the fact that their continent is suffering from an economic order that perpetuates poverty and inequality, continually creates social and political crises and provides no prospects for progress and development? I raise those questions at a time when Egypt is chairing the Group of 77 and China, whose member States make up a majority of the population of this planet and therefore have an enormous interest in enhancing the role of the United Nations. Developing countries cannot afford to exist in an international order that is not governed by laws and the lofty principles  on which the United Nations was founded, or in one that can be polarized and subjected to attempts by some to dominate it and impose their will on the rest of the international community.\nLet me sum up Egypt\u2019s vision in three key principles to which we ought to renew our commitment, and three causes to which we must accord priority if the United Nations is to regain its effectiveness and role. The first principle is that there is no way to  achieve an effective international order if its main constituent unit, the nation State, which is premised on the notions\n \nof citizenship, democracy and equality, is threatened with disintegration. I speak based on Egypt\u2019s unique experience. The Egyptian people have made tremendous efforts to restore their State and save their identity. They chose the capable and just nation State as the pathway to reform in order to achieve their aspirations for freedom, development and dignity.\nThe disintegration of nations as a result of civil strife and regression to sectarian loyalty rather national identity is responsible for the most dangerous phenomena in our contemporary world, such as armed conflicts, human trafficking, illegal migration, organized crime and the illicit trade in arms and drugs.\nThere is no doubt that the Arab region is one of  the most vulnerable in the world to the dangers of the disintegration of nation States and the ensuing creation of a fertile environment for terrorism and worsening sectarian conflict. Preserving and reforming the foundation of the State is therefore a fundamental priority of Egypt\u2019s foreign policy in the Arab region. There can be no way out of the crisis in Syria or the plight of Yemen except by restoring the nation State and preserving its sovereignty and institutions, as well as realizing the legitimate aspirations of its people. Egypt fully supports a United Nations-led political solution in those two brother countries and rejects any exploitation as a means to achieve regional intervention or foster an environment for terrorism, extremism and sectarianism. That same principle applies to our policy on Libya, where Egypt is playing a pivotal role in support of rebuilding the State, especially with respect to the unification of the Libyan armed forces so that they can be capable of defending Libya and countering the dangers of terrorism.\nWe must not forget that a year has already passed since the adoption of the United Nations initiative on Libya, which seeks to comprehensively address the Libyan crisis. To date, no progress has been made in its implementation, which means we must renew our commitment to reaching a  political solution, as per  all the elements of the initiative. There is  no  room  for partial solutions in Libya, Syria or Yemen. Major crises require comprehensive approaches, not partial solutions, if we are to halt the loss of life and resources and begin the construction phase.\nThe second principle is a commitment to peaceful and sustainable solutions to international conflicts. That is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations. Yet\ndespite the efforts of the United Nations in numerous conflicts, such as those in South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Mali, so far it has undoubtedly fallen short of finding permanent settlements for them. There is also an urgent need to mobilize resources to help countries in post-conflict situations rehabilitate their institutions and begin reconstruction and development. The fundamental issue here is translating that principle into tangible support for national efforts to overcome conflicts and build States in accordance with their priorities, while  avoiding  the  imposition of alien models of governance and development or interfering in the internal affairs of States and violating their sovereignty.\nWe cannot talk about the settlement of  disputes  as a founding principle of the United Nations and an indicator of its credibility without addressing the Palestinian question, which is a perfect example of the failure of the international system to find a just solution based on international legitimacy and the United Nations resolutions that guarantee the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. The terms of reference of a just solution and the parameters of a final settlement are well known. There is no  time to waste on  that debate. What is required  is the political will to resume negotiations and achieve a settlement in accordance with those premises. Let me repeat what I have said in previous years at this rostrum \u2014 Arabs continue to extend a hand for peace. Our peoples deserve to turn this tragic page in history.\nThe third principle is a commitment to achieving comprehensive and sustainable development as a necessary precondition for a stable world order and the best way for preventing armed conflict and humanitarian crises. While we welcome the consensus reached on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we note that the implementation of the Goals in that ambitious plan require us to address the problem of financing  for development. That can be achieved by creating an international environment that enables the free flow of resources necessary for development without imposing any conditions, while supporting national efforts to mobilize financing for development. The reform of the global economic and financial architecture cannot be delayed. We look forward to seeing the United Nations serve as a platform for developing ideas to achieve this reform, particularly with regard to the creation of mechanisms that would help to prevent illicit financial\n \nflows out of developing countries and facilitate the return of such vital assets to their rightful owners.\nThe international commitment to the preservation of the nation State, the peaceful settlement of disputes, strengthening cooperation to achieve comprehensive development and address imbalances in the global economic system are all necessary conditions for any serious consideration of the revitalization of the United Nations system and the restoration of its credibility. In order to implement these three principles, three priority causes must also be addressed  in  order  to  ensure  the credibility and the future of the United Nations Organization and the international order as a whole.\nFirst, we need to strengthen partnerships between the United Nations and regional organizations. Here    I would like to  point  to  the  successful  experience  of cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union (AU) as a model to be followed. That would help to share the burdens and enable us to benefit from the comparative advantages of both parties in order to address the complex challenges in our region. The main aim of the international efforts is to maintain and build peace and provide humanitarian and developmental assistance.\nEgypt is poised  to  assume  the  presidency  of  the African Union in 2019 and looks forward to strengthening  the strategic   partnership   between the African Union and the United Nations through programmes that have a real impact on the continent and by building on gains made in order to consolidate the African Union post-conflict reconstruction and development policy. Egypt is alo host to the AU Center for Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development and the counter-terrorism centre for the regional community of Sahel-Saharan States.\nSecondly, we must continue our efforts to implement the initiative launched by Egypt during its membership of the Security Council to put in place a comprehensive international framework to develop policies and bolster cooperation in countering terrorism. In that context, we   welcomed   the   Secretary-General\u2019s   initiative to convene the High-level Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of Member States in June, following the periodic review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\nAs the Assembly is well aware, early this year Egypt launched its comprehensive Sinai 2018 operation to combat and decisively eradicate terrorism through\na strategy that addresses its security, ideological and development aspects. Based on that  experience  and on Egypt\u2019s overall experience in supporting counter- terrorism efforts in the Middle East and North Africa, I can assure the Assembly that the level of financing, the sophisticated arms and training, as well as the means of communication obtained by those extremist groups, as well as the ease of movement and travel of foreign terrorist fighters, point to the inevitable need to develop a global system to combat terrorism wherever it exists and to cut its sources of support in every possible way.\nThirdly, we must address the shortcomings in the international community\u2019s handling of human rights issues. The credibility of the United Nations cannot  be restored as long as millions continue to suffer from extreme poverty, live under foreign occupation or fall victim to terrorism and armed conflict. Human rights will not be protected through media defamation, the politicization of human rights mechanisms or the failure to equitably address all issues of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights.\nEgypt has a solid constitutional foundation for the protection of all human rights. Major strides have been achieved in the area of the empowerment of women and young people. Women now hold 25 per cent of the ministerial posts and more than 15 per cent  of  seats in Parliament. We rely on young people in all leading positions in the country, while the international youth conferences that are held annually in Egypt have also become a regular forum for them to communicate and raise their concerns and priorities. We are determined to continue to accord high priority to the issues of women\u2019s economic empowerment, youth, science, technology and innovation during Egypt\u2019s presidency of the Group of 77 and China, as a practical demonstration of our commitment to the comprehensive promotion of human rights.\nEgypt, like the vast majority of the world\u2019s peoples and nations, has a vested interest in restoring the credibility of international multilateral  action  with the United Nations at its forefront. We believe  that  the Organization can overcome scepticism about its merits and credibility by restoring the lofty principles on which its Charter was premised and by acting in accordance with the priorities I have addressed, which reflect the aspirations of our peoples. Only then will our Organization reclaim its credibility and our peoples regain their confidence in a future of peace, cooperation and respect for one another.\n"

        "file_text": "E nga mana nul o nga whenua o te ao/Tena koutou katoa/Nei ra te reo mihl maioha o Aotearoa/Tena tatau i nga kaupapa korero/Ka arahina e tatau/Me te ngakau pono/Me te kotahitanga o te tangata.\nMy opening remarks were in Te Reo Maori, the language of the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand. As is tradition, I acknowledged those who are here, why we are here and the importance of our work. It seems a fitting place to start.\nAs a leader attending my first General Assembly, I am struck by the power and potential that resides here. In New Zealand we have always been acutely aware of that. We are a  remote nation at  the bottom  of the South Pacific. It takes three hours to reach our nearest neighbours by plane, and anywhere that takes less than 12 hours is considered close. I have no doubt, though, that our geographic isolation has contributed to our values.\nWe are a self-deprecating people.  We  are  not ones for status. We will celebrate the  local  people who volunteer at their sports clubs as  much  as  we will celebrate successful entrepreneurs. Our empathy and strong sense of justice are matched only by our pragmatism. We are, after all, a country made up of two main islands, one simply named North and the other South. For all of that, our isolation has not made us insular. In fact, our engagement with the world has helped shape who we are.\nI am a child of the 1980s, a period in New Zealand\u2019s history where we did not just observe international events, we challenged them. Whether it was apartheid in South Africa or nuclear testing in the Pacific, I grew up learning about my country and who we were by the way that we reacted to international events. Whether it was taking to the streets or changing our laws, we have seen ourselves as members of a community, one that we have a duty to use our voice within.\nI am an incredibly proud New Zealander, but much of that pride has come from being a strong and active member of our international community, not in spite of it. At the heart of that international community has been this place. Emerging from a catastrophic war, we have collectively established \u2014 through convention, charters and rules \u2014 a set of international norms and human rights. All of these are an acknowledgement that we are not isolated, that Governments do have obligations to their people and to one another and that our actions have a global effect.\nIn 1945, New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Peter Fraser said that the Charter of the United Nations offered perhaps a last opportunity to work in unison to realize the hope in the hearts of all of us, for a peace that would be real, lasting and worthy of human dignity. None of those founding principles should be consigned to the history books. In  fact,  given  the  challenges we face today and how truly global they are in their nature and impact, the need for collective action and multilateralism has never been clearer. And yet,  for  all of that, the debate and dialogue we  hear globally is not centred on the relevance and importance of our international institutions. Instead, we find ourselves having to defend their very existence. That surely leaves us all with the questions of how we got here and how we get out.\nIf anything unites us politically in this place right now it is this: globalization has had a massive impact on our nations and the people we serve. While that impact has been positive for many, for others it has not. The transitions our economies have made have often been jarring and the consequences harsh. Alongside unprecedented global economic growth, we are still seeing a growing sense of isolation, dislocation and insecurity and the erosion of hope. As politicians and Governments, we all have choices in how we respond to those challenges. We can use the environment to blame nameless and faceless others, feed the sense of insecurity and retreat into greater levels of isolationism,\n \nor we can acknowledge the problems we have and seek to fix them.\nIn New Zealand, going it alone is not an option. Aside from our history, we are also a trading nation, and proudly so, but even without those founding principles, there are not just questions of nationhood to consider. There are generational demands on us too. It should hardly come as a surprise that we have seen  a global trend of young people showing dissatisfaction with our political systems and calling on us to do things differently. Why would they not, when they themselves have had to adapt so rapidly to a changing world?\nWithin a few short decades, we now have a generation that will grow up more connected than ever before. Digital transformation will determine whether the jobs they are training for will even exist in two decades. In education or the job market, they will not just compete with their neighbours but their neighbouring countries. This generation is a borderless one, at least in a virtual sense, and its members increasingly see themselves as global citizens. As their reality changes, they expect that ours will too, that we will see and understand our collective impact and that we will change the way we use our power.\nIf we are looking for an example of where the next generation is calling on us to make that change, we need look no further than climate change. Two weeks ago, Pacific Island leaders gathered together at the Pacific Islands Forum. It was at that meeting, in the small island nation of Nauru, that climate change was declared the single biggest threat to security in the Pacific. Please, just think about that for a moment. Of all the challenges we debate and discuss, rising sea levels present the single biggest threat to our region.\nFor those who live in the South Pacific, the impacts of climate change are not academic, or even arguable. They are watching the sea levels rise, the extreme weather events increase and the impact that has on their water supply and food crops. We can talk all we like about the science and what it means and what temperature rises we need to limit in order to survive, but there is a grinding reality in hearing people from  a Pacific island talk about where the sea was when they were children and the potential loss of their entire village now that they are adults.\nOur action in the wake of that global challenge remains optional, but the impact  of  inaction  does not. Nations like Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands or\nKiribati \u2014 small countries that have contributed the least to global climate change \u2014 are suffering, and will suffer, the full force of a warming planet. If my Pacific neighbours do not have the option of opting out of the effects of climate change, why should we be able to opt out of taking action to stop it? Any disintegration of multilateralism and any undermining of climate-related targets and agreements are not interesting footnotes in geopolitical history. They are catastrophic.\nIn New Zealand we are determined to play our part. We will not issue any further offshore oil and gas exploration permits. We have set a goal of 100 per cent renewable energy generation by 2035, established a green infrastructure fund to encourage innovation and rolled out an initiative to plant 1 billion trees over the next 10 years. Those plans are unashamedly ambitious. The threat that climate change poses demands it. But we represent less than 0.2 per cent of global emissions. That is why, as a global community, not since the inception of the United Nations has there been a greater example than climate change of the importance of collective action and multilateralism. It should be a rallying cry for all of us.\nYet there is a hesitance that we can ill afford and a calculation of personal cost and self-interest. But that is not the only challenge where domestic self-interest is the first response and where an international or collective approach has been diluted at best, or rejected at worst. But it would be both unfair and naive  to argue that retreating to our own borders and interests has meant turning our backs on a perfect system. The international institutions that we have committed to have not been perfect. But they can be fixed.\nThat is why  the challenge I  want to issue today   is this: together, we must rebuild and recommit to multilateralism. We must redouble our efforts  to  work as a global community. We must rediscover our shared belief in the value, rather than the harm, of connectedness. We must demonstrate that collective international action not only works but is in all of our best interests. We must show the next generation that we are listening and have heard them.\nBut if we are truly going to take on a reform agenda, we must acknowledge the failings that have led us to this crossroads. International trade, for instance, has helped bring millions of people out of poverty around the world. But some have felt their standard of living slide. We in New Zealand have ourselves seen\n \nthe hesitancy around trade agreements within our own population. The correct response is not to repeat the mistakes of the past and be seduced by the false promises of protectionism. Rather, we must all work to ensure that the benefits of trade are distributed fairly across our societies.\nWe cannot rely on international institutions to do that, in the same way that we cannot blame them if they have not delivered those benefits. It is incumbent on us to build productive, sustainable and inclusive economies and demonstrate to our peoples that, when done right, international economic integration can make us all better off. If we want to ensure that everyone is better off, surely we should start with the most vulnerable.\nWe in New Zealand have set ourselves an ambitious goal. We want to be the best place in the world to be a child. It is hardly the stuff of hard and fast measures \u2014 after all, how are play and a feeling of security and happiness measured? But we can measure material deprivation and poverty, and so we will. Moreover, we are making it a law that we report on those numbers every single year alongside our budgets. What better way is there to hold ourselves to account, and what better group to do that for than children?\nBut if we are focused on nurturing that next generation, we equally have to  worry about  what  it  is that we are handing down to them, including our environment. In the Maori language there is a word that captures the importance of that role, kaitiakitanga, which means guardianship. That is the idea that we have been entrusted with our environment and have a duty to care for it. For us, that has meant taking action to address degradation, such as setting standards to make our rivers swimmable, reducing waste and phasing out single-use plastic bags, right through to eradicating predators and protecting our biodiversity. The race to grow our economies and increase wealth makes us all the poorer if it comes at the cost of our environment. We in New Zealand are determined to prove that it does not have to be that way. But those are all actions and initiatives that we can take domestically that ease the blame and pressure on our international institutions. That does not mean they do not need fixing.\nAt the heart of the multilateral system, the United Nations must lead the way. We strongly support the Secretary-General\u2019s reform efforts to make the United Nations more responsive, effective and modernized so that it is capable of dealing with today\u2019s challenges.\nWe encourage him to be ambitious, and  we  stand with him in that ambition. But ultimately it is up  to  us, the Member States, to drive change here at the United Nations. That includes reforming the Security Council. If we want the Council to fulfil its purpose  of maintaining international peace and security, its practices must be updated so that it is not hamstrung by the use of the veto.\nNew thinking will also be needed if we are to achieve the vision encapsulated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In New Zealand we have sought to  embed the  principles behind the  SDGs  in a new living-standards framework that is guiding policymaking and the management of our resources. We remain absolutely committed to supporting the rollout of the SDGs alongside international partners through a significant increase in our official development assistance budget.\nBut revitalizing our international rules-based system is not just about the mechanics of how we work together. It also means renewing our commitment to our values. The Charter of the United Nations recalls that the Organization was formed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which after two world wars had brought untold sorrow to humankind. If we forget that history and the principles that drove the creation of the United Nations, we will be doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.\nIn an increasingly uncertain world it is more important than ever that we remember the core values on which the United Nations was built \u2014 that all people are equal, that all are entitled to have their dignity and human rights respected and that we must strive to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. We must consistently hold ourselves to account on each one.\nIn addition to renewing that commitment, though, we must acknowledge where accountability must continue, and that is especially the case when it comes to equality. So many gains have been made, and each is worthy of celebration. In New Zealand we have just marked the 125th year since women were granted the right to vote. We were the first country in the world to do so. As a girl I never grew up believing that my gender would stand in the way of my achieving whatever I wanted in life. I am, after all, not the first but the third female Prime Minister of New Zealand.\n \nBut for all of that, we still have a gender pay gap and an overrepresentation of women in low-paid work and as victims of domestic violence. And we are not alone. It seems surprising that in this modern age we should have to recommit to gender equality, but we  do. I for one will never celebrate the gains we have made for women domestically while internationally other women and girls experience a lack of the most basic opportunities and dignity. #MeToo must become #WeToo. We are all in this together.\nI accept that the list of demands, whether domestic or international, on all of us is long. We are operating in challenging times. We face what we in New Zealand would call wicked problems, ones that are intertwined and interrelated. Perhaps then it is time to step back from the chaos and ask what we want. It is in that space that we will find simplicity, the simplicity of peace, prosperity and fairness.\nIf I could distil it into one concept that we are pursuing in New Zealand it is simple and it is this: kindness. In the face of isolationism, protectionism and racism, the simple concept of looking outwardly and beyond ourselves and of kindness and collectivism might be just as good a starting point as any. Let us therefore start here, with the institutions that have served us well in times of need and will do so again.\nIn the meantime, I can assure everyone here that New Zealand remains committed to continuing to do its part in building and sustaining international peace and security; promoting and defending an open, inclusive and rules-based international order based on universal values; and being pragmatic, empathetic, strong and kind. The next generation, after all, deserves no less.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate you, Madam President, on your election, and wish you great success as you embark on your noble and challenging mission. I also wish to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, of the Republic of Slovakia, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, for his excellent work during his term.\nNext, I would like to express my utmost appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his smart and competent stewardship of our common house, and to reaffirm our full trust and profound respect for his leadership, particularly amid the many difficulties that the world currently faces. I am referring, for example, to terrorism, which is spreading in many countries; the migration crisis, particularly on the African continent,\n \nfrom where we get news, virtually every day, of young people, children and women who have abandoned their homes out of desperation and ventured into the world in search of a better life only to face subhuman conditions; the impact of climate change on human security; conflicts and other threats to peace coming to us from all quarters of the world; and the glaring situation of poverty, which continues to be a reality that puts our global capacity to leave no one behind to the test.\nIn order to mitigate those and other problems that all of us present here in this Assembly face, the United Nations has worked tirelessly under the leadership of our Secretary-General, to whom I would like to express, once again, our profound gratitude. To address those problems, the President of the General Assembly could not have proposed a more appropriate theme for her presidency than \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people\u201d, while also promoting multilateralism, which I define here as combining efforts and taking a path to global leadership and shared responsibilities in order to build the peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies that we all desire.\nWe will celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December. However, hate, discrimination and violence are still alive and present. As the Director-General of UNESCO has stated:\n\u201cHundreds of millions of women and men are destitute, deprived of basic livelihoods and opportunities. Forced population movements are violating rights on an unprecedented scale. The 2030\nAgenda for Sustainable Development promises to leave no one behind \u2014 human rights must be the bedrock for all progress moving forward.\u201d\nThe date of  10  December,  Human  Rights  Day, is strategically important in that human rights have established a universal standard for society to achieve, one that is globally inclusive and socially emancipating, enabling all human beings to realize their free and full development. The fact that universal standards and principles of human rights are integral to the legal order of many countries is a major advancement for humankind. However, that does not mean that such standards and principles are fully and effectively accepted. In fact, human rights achievements translate into a framework of rights that combine with cultural or historical conditions to weave a non-linear history that is at times contradictory but always open and never- ending.\nRespect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights therefore constitutes an unquestionably noble goal and, at the same time, remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Although the struggle for its effectiveness is intensifying, violations have virtually been institutionalized in many parts of the world. Such violations have also been observed in situations of war, which unfortunately afflicts many parts of the world, especially Africa, taking on unacceptable dimensions through increasingly common practices such as human trafficking, including the trafficking of children, organized transnational crime and acts of genocide and other war crimes. Despite those unfavourable conditions, we raise the banner of hope and fight to defend and promote fundamental human rights, driven, above all, by our faith in the  capacity of  humankind to creatively mould reality to our will, notwithstanding causalities and constraints.\nOur country\u2019s choice to pursue a policy of peace, dialogue and understanding to prevent and resolve conflicts acknowledges and reflects those values. Furthermore, it emanates from the very nature of the Cabo Verdean people \u2014 from the culture of tolerance that has allowed our policies to be shaped by such values and principles over four decades of history as a sovereign nation. In our day-to-day lives, we have demonstrated that tolerance is possible and that the sharing of values is a reality, even in the face of adversity.\nWe profoundly regret to see that the death penalty still exists in many countries around the world. The\n \nexistence of the death penalty in the twenty-first century demands profound, careful and responsible reflection from all of us. It  is a  fact that the search  for a new universal conscience will lead us to rethink our understanding of the purposes and motivations behind human coexistence, but they should always be based on respect for life and the immanent dignity of human beings.\nThe Constitution and justice system of Cabo Verde do not provide for life sentences or the death penalty. In fact, the death penalty has not been applied in our country since before the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Our unique historical and social  condition has instilled in us cultural principles and values that promote the right to life under all circumstances. In that regard, we wish to reiterate our absolute support for the recent appeal by Pope Francis to the conscience of State authorities around the world to seek an international consensus on the abolition of the death penalty. In addition to calling for the unequivocal, firm and exemplary repudiation of capital punishment, Pope Francis also spoke against the so-called extrajudicial executions, or illegal killings that are being committed.\nIn the name of clemency and prudence, we firmly believe that capital punishment is not an appropriate and fair instrument, nor is it efficient in achieving justice, in the light of its insurmountable conditionalities and weaknesses. As a superior value, life cannot be left at the mercy of presumably fallible judges, who, unaware of the laws of clemency, imprudently insist on donning the soiled robe of the executioner, succumbing to the dim light cast by a law that, in terms of relative values, is certainly not above the value of life and the ethics that it embodies.\nMoreover, we also believe that, based on an unwavering and optimistic anthropology, human beings can be rehabilitated and that, in the modern world, there exist institutional conditions and less grievous forms of punishment that are still suitable and effective and which avoid the shameful radical solution of ending the life of a fellow human being. Viewing criminal justice in the context of the rule of law, capital punishment is therefore unjustifiable. It is along those lines that we fully subscribe to the plea by the Holy Father Pope Francis for a universal moratorium on executions.\nThrough the 43 years of its independence, Cabo Verde, a small island State with major shortages of resources, is proud to be a democratic country built on\nthe rule of law through the sacrifice and determination of Cabo Verdeans residing in the country and abroad.  I believe that my country can contribute, even if modestly, to the quest for solutions to major problems that currently afflict our troubled world. More than a model of the political stability that characterizes our country or of the democratic regime that we have built and consolidated, the nation of Cabo Verde, which predates the creation of the Cabo Verdean State, may be considered an example of peaceful coexistence among people from different countries and with different beliefs who have been blended into a unique and diverse culture that is open to the world and to the sharing of values.\nWithout any pretence or false modesty, I am also proud of our country\u2019s  journey  from  independence to the present day. In fact, I  can say  that, according  to the human, economic and financial indices, our country\u2019s achievements have been favourably received by major  international  institutions,  particularly those in the financial arena. However, with our country\u2019s service-based economy, its very small market and an agricultural sector that is struggling against desertification and scarce rainfall, we cannot ignore our significant vulnerabilities, and we  note that we must not rest because we have graduated to middle-income-country status. Indeed, we believe that we must not lose sight of the fact that our economy continues to be very dependent and that it cannot absorb a large number of our workers, with all the social effects that that entails, which is why we continue to rely on international solidarity. Naturally, we must also increase our reliance on domestic resources, develop through public-private partnerships and become more effective in fighting extreme poverty, social exclusion and unemployment, particularly among young people, thereby promoting  growth  and  development  in Cabo Verde.\nOur constraints with respect to energy, water, health and sanitation, to name just a few areas, will require our continued attention, and we will need to build the necessary infrastructure to create the conditions for ensuring our economy\u2019s sustainable growth. Similarly, as we look to our future, we must also consider the increasingly disastrous impacts that climate change and other natural disasters are having on the world, particularly on small island developing States.\nCabo Verde graduated to a middle-income country in 2008, when the world was gripped by a major\n \ninternational financial crisis, which contributed to  our missing the window of opportunity created by our graduation. Since then, the structural vulnerabilities afflicting our country have become not only aggravated but also more complex. We see this situation in our growing regional asymmetries, which are exacerbated by the lack of territorial continuity that goes with being an island nation, the nefarious effects of drought, desertification and other climate changes, as well as weak production capacity, unemployment of young people, social and gender inequalities, the excessive burden of external debt on the budget, and the difficulties in internally connecting our country by air and sea, which hampers the creation of a competitive and coherent market, which is essential for developing tourism. Such facts convince us of the relevance of and need for support measures that are distinct and adjusted to the realities of our country in the areas of development, trade and foreign debt.\nFinally, we call for more substantial inclusion of and a greater voice for developing countries within the United Nations system, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and other institutions in line with the work that is already being pursued. To that end, in December 2018, the Government of Cabo Verde will convene a round table in Paris to make an appeal for the mobilization of innovative partnerships that are consistent with our reality as a small island developing State. Cabo Verde will want to hear what our development partners think of the relevance of  our proposals and options, and to discuss forms of cooperation with them, in close coordination with our agreed national efforts, including the alignment  of our national development plan with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. We therefore count on the support of the members of the Assembly on Cabo Verde\u2019s journey towards the sustainable development for which we all strive.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session and assure her of Uganda\u2019s full support. We are confident that she will lead the Assembly effectively and successfully. I would also like to express our gratitude to Mr. Miroslav  Laj\u010d\u00e1k  for  his  leadership at the seventy-second session. I also  pay  tribute  to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his personal dedication and commitment to the work of the United Nations.\nThe theme for the seventy-third session \u2014 \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d \u2014 is very pertinent. Three years ago, in this Hall, we adopted the universal and transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), to guide our efforts over the next 15 years. At the heart of the 2030 Agenda was a pledge to leave no one behind. That meant that the  17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targets should be met for everyone, with a particular\n \nfocus on the poorest, most vulnerable and furthest behind \u2014 people who are indeed often left out.\nWe in Uganda have devoted a reasonable amount of time and resources to follow through on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and  establish links between the SDGs and our national priorities. We are working deliberately to ensure that the SDGs are implemented in an effective and timely manner for the socioeconomic transformation and improvement of our people\u2019s livelihoods. To do so, we have integrated 76 per cent of the SDGs into our national development plan for the period 2015-2020, as part of the Uganda Vision 2040.\nFrom our engagements so far, it is evident that the biggest challenge remains the obtaining of adequate financing to implement the 2030 Agenda \u2014 an issue that arose clearly in the high-level political forum held in New York in June. We in Uganda are doing our best to mobilize resources, both domestic and external, to implement the SDGs. We are committed to leveraging support into productive areas, including the private sector, which has the potential to boost our economy and thereby contribute additional internally-generated resources to help implement the SDGs. We call upon development partners to fulfil their commitments and extend their support in terms of timely and adequate means for the implementation of the SDGs, as well as to prioritize the special needs of the most vulnerable countries and strengthen partnerships with them.\nOur development and transformation cannot take place without peace and security, which are prerequisites for socioeconomic transformation. We should devote our attention to supporting an environment that is peaceful, thereby enabling us to concentrate on growth and development. Today, challenges transcend borders, and no country alone can carry the weight of the world on its shoulders. We must redouble our collective efforts to seek common solutions to pressing regional and global challenges, including conflicts in various parts of the world, transnational organized crime, terrorism and violent extremism.\nWe must be unwavering in our resolve to combat terrorism, religious extremism and terrorism from groups such as Al-Shabaab, Boko  Haram,  the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaida, which constitute threats to our common security and development. That threat is compounded today, given the possibility of linkages between terrorism and the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Those challenges cut across national boundaries and require collective responses.\nUganda remains committed to multilateralism as a means of achieving comprehensive and equitable solutions to global problems and challenges. In order to respond successfully to global crises, threats and challenges, the international community needs an efficient multilateral system. It is for that reason that Uganda has continued to advance the cause for a revitalized, reformed and effective United Nations system. That is critical if we are to make the United Nations more responsive, more efficient and more effective in its support for Member States\u2019 efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nUganda supports the comprehensive reform of the Security Council, and our approach is consistent with the African continent\u2019s common position, as enunciated in the Ezulwini Consensus. First, African issues dominate the Security Council agenda, and therefore the vast majority of decisions made by the Security Council affect African countries. Secondly, over the past few years, Africa has shown its commitment to conflict prevention, mediation and resolution, as demonstrated by its leadership and response to conflict situations that have developed in the continent over the past few years.\nWe believe that for a continent with 54 countries,  a population of more than 1 billion people and demonstrable political commitment, Africa should have a greater voice in the global political debate, which would increase the legitimacy of the decisions of  the Security Council and foster its effectiveness.   It is essential that the Council membership, in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories, be equitable and reflect today\u2019s geopolitical realities. We therefore support the efforts of Member States to move the intergovernmental negotiations process on Security Council reform forward, and we call for a constructive spirit aimed at realizing the long-awaited reform.\nStrengthening South-South cooperation is critical to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Over the 40 years of its existence,  South- South cooperation has proved to be a valuable avenue for building capacity and promoting development in developing countries. It has also facilitated cooperation, as manifested in South-South and triangular cooperation. It is our desire that we expand the scope of South-South cooperation to include, among other\n \nelements, trade, investment, infrastructure, tourism, peacebuilding and other areas  of  mutual  interest. We look forward to the forthcoming United Nations ministerial conference on South-South cooperation, which is to be held in Buenos Aires and which, we hope, will devote time to considering how to strengthen and further revitalize such cooperation within the context of a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.\nThe United Nations has the primary responsibility for  international   peace   and   security.   However, in undertaking that role, it is essential that the Organization support initiatives undertaken by regional and subregional organizations. That partnership should be based on the division of labour, burden-sharing and complementarity, as well as mutual respect.\nIn Africa, the evidence is that, where such cooperation has taken place, the results have been positive. One example is the cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union on the situation in Somalia, where the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has supported the efforts of the Somali Government to stabilize the country. Uganda has played an active role in those regional initiatives. Since AMISOM\u2019s deployment 11 years ago, we have witnessed tremendous progress in Somalia.\nThe Somali Government, previously based outside the country, has been based in Mogadishu since 2007. International organizations, including the United Nations and diplomatic missions, have also relocated to Mogadishu. More than 80 per cent of the areas dominated by Al-Shabaab have been liberated. The area of piracy and the threat that piracy had caused at sea, threatening international shipping and trade, has been neutralized. Business is thriving, and there are numerous reconstruction activities in many parts of the country. Incidentally, regular elections have also been held.\nThose positive developments and Somalia\u2019s relative stability would hardly have been possible without the contribution and sacrifice of AMISOM and the Somali security forces. Uganda appreciates the support that the African Union and international partners have given to AMISOM, which was never intended to be in Somalia forever. That is why it is essential that Somalia be supported in providing security for its people. It is crucial that any reduction in the number of AMISOM troops correspond with the strengthening of the Somali security forces. The failure to carefully manage that\nprocess could imperil the political and security gains already made in Somalia.\nOn South Sudan, Uganda has actively participated in the peace process launched in June 2017  and led   by Intergovernmental Authority on Development. We welcome the recently signed and revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. The Agreement outlines guidelines on power sharing, governance and security arrangements, including the settling of boundary disputes, which will be guided by a boundary commission. We call on the international community to support the implementation of the Agreement.\nClimate  change  remains  a   major   challenge and a threat to our efforts to achieve sustainable development. Uganda supported the efforts to reach the new, universally binding Paris Agreement on Climate Change, reached in December 2015. Uganda was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the Agreement last year. We must continue to muster the political will necessary to fully implement the Agreement. There is a need for the enhanced delivery of finance to the most vulnerable countries to support their climate-change mitigation and adaptation measures.\nAs highlighted in the 2030 Agenda, we can be the first generation to succeed in ending poverty, just as we may be the last generation to have a chance of saving the planet. Let all of us commit ourselves to preventing wars and to promoting peace. Let us build new international relations. Let us reduce inequalities. Let us ensure that no one is left behind. And let us support the primary role of the United Nations as the principal organization for addressing global challenges.\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda coincided with the onset of what would become Uganda\u2019s single largest refugee influx in its history. As a country, we now host 1.4 million refugees, which is the largest number on the African continent and ranks quite high at the global level.\nThe presence of large numbers of  refugees, mostly arriving unexpectedly and quickly, amplifies the existing vulnerability of host communities.  It also places a huge demand on already over-stretched national capacities and resources.\nUganda remains committed to maintaining and promoting asylum space and its refugee model, consistent with the 2016 New York Declaration for\n \nRefugees and Migrants. We do that because we know that no one chooses to be a refugee. We also understand the critical importance of treating refugees humanely, decently and with dignity. We remain committed to working with national, regional and international actors to address the drivers of displacement and refugees. We are grateful for the solidarity and support that the international community has extended to Uganda thus far. It is our expectation that the new global compact on refugees will provide the much needed predictable and equitable burden- and responsibility-sharing among all Member States.\nLastly, Uganda remains ready to work with the Secretary-General and all Member  States to  realize  a United Nations that is more inclusive, effective and responsive to the needs of the peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I extend the warm congratulations of His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingb\u00e9, President of the Togolese Republic, to the President of the General Assembly on her well-deserved election to preside over the Assembly at its seventy-third session. I also assure her of the support of my country, Togo.\nAt the same time, I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for the masterful leadership he showed during his term as President of the General Assembly at the previous session. I am also particularly pleased to commend the sense of human affairs and practical wisdom of the Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. We appreciate his clearly expressed commitment and daily work in support of the principles and values of the Organization, which we share.\nI would like to welcome the relevance of the choice of the theme for this session, which draws the attention of all of us to a challenge that is essential, because it is fundamental: decentralizing the exercise of responsibilities at the United Nations level in order to bring the Organization into line with the realities of a plural and multipolar world. Taking that into account\n \nwill undoubtedly broaden the basis of the legitimacy and effectiveness of the United Nations in the world.\nUnited Nations reform is less a wish than a logical necessity. The world has evolved; new problems and actors have emerged; the planet itself is now suffering; violent extremism and terrorism threaten the world; and new forms of responsibility have emerged. As a centre for the exercise of  collective responsibility on  a global scale, the United Nations must update the  way in which it is organized and functions if it is to effectively play its role as an institution in the service of the human community. The time has come, in the words of the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, for a paradigm shift.\nI would like to reiterate my country\u2019s support for and commitment to the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative for the far-reaching reform of the Organization, which has the merit of being based on an open and inclusive process that takes into account the three main institutional pillars of the United Nations system: peace and security, development and the management structure. The reform initiative is focused on restructuring the peace and security pillar, which will help to make the institution more pragmatic and effective.\nThe link between peace, security and development is well established. Without peace and security, there can be no sustainable development, nor development of any kind nor the building of resilient and sustainable societies. The new United Nations peace and security architecture must therefore be intrinsically linked to the broader development pillar, which includes respect for and promotion of human rights and the strengthening of humanitarian action. The ongoing reform should reposition the United Nations development system to adapt it to the new requirements associated with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order ultimately to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and push back the boundaries of objective poverty and domestic and global inequality.\nThe United Nations must do more to help address the world\u2019s lack of development. One more step in the war on the development deficit will help our world to lift entire segments of the world\u2019s population out of the misery of their position and condition, and restore their autonomy and power of control over their own lives. The Organization\u2019s new development system must accommodate the need to build a world in which each country enjoys sustained, inclusive and sustainable\neconomic growth. The aim is to reorient the system with significant adjustments focusing on skills, leadership, coordination and accountability mechanisms.\nThis new restructuring of development mechanisms must also aim at the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The challenges of climate change are vital, and our response must not wait. Obviously, in our response to the challenges of climate change, a significant place must be given to the promotion of partnerships and innovative mechanisms for financing development, in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.\nWith regard to the management pillar of the ongoing reform, we are pleased to note  that  the major changes envisaged correspond to the need to improve the Organization\u2019s internal management methods by simplifying procedures, decentralizing action and investing in people in order to better meet the requirements of sustainable development and for building a peaceful world. Investing in people means taking a stand for development and peace in the world. In short, the reform we are talking about today aims to make the United Nations more dynamic and capable. The current global challenges call for the strengthening of the operational capabilities of the United Nations.\nThe challenges facing Africa today are immense. Our continent continues to face new forms of crises and difficulties. Unfortunately, Africa is now  home  to hotbeds of terrorism in some of its regions and countries, where people who legitimately aspire to peace of mind face daily acts of barbarism that feed on violent extremism, religious ignorance and intolerance, and ideological fanaticism.\nPoverty persists in Africa, and African populations are seeking well-being. The consequences of climate change are terrible, and migration is decimating a significant part of Africa\u2019s young people and making them vulnerable. The current challenges relating to the difficult issue of migration and  the  human tragedies it generates appeal to our conscience and sense of collective responsibility and call for appropriate and sustainable responses. In that regard, the Togolese Government urges all stakeholders to give priority to the participatory approach and the logic of consensus in the ongoing negotiation process and to work with determination towards the adoption, at the Marrakech Conference on 10 and 11 December 2018, of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.\n \nThe General Assembly will certainly agree with me that the emergence of the peaceful, equitable, prosperous and sustainable societies that we all want cannot become a tangible reality unless priority is given to effective, innovative and mutually beneficial partnership mechanisms. To that end, the United Nations should, in order to play its full coordinating role, rely more on regional and subregional organizations in the fields of international peace and security and development.\nIn the case of Africa, where development problems are acute, Governments have become aware of the need to accelerate the regional integration process in order to pool development efforts and poverty-reduction strategies, as recommended under the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development  Goals. Several initiatives  are  currently  under  way to further strengthen that integration. In that regard, Togo welcomes the appointment of its President, His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingb\u00e9, by his peers to lead the project to establish the Single African Air Transport Market, which is an important instrument for the continent\u2019s  economic integration. The effort  to mobilize States to sign that solemn undertaking is ongoing, with a view to creating such a market.\nOn the issue of international peace and security, our priority today is to strengthen international cooperation in peacekeeping operations and in the fight against terrorism. We must redouble our efforts to end conflicts, especially in Africa and many other parts of the world. This is an opportunity to pay tribute to, and acknowledge the true value of, the leading role that the United Nations has always played in the world through its various peacekeeping missions, the majority of which, unfortunately, involve the African continent.\nIt is my pleasure to welcome in passing the Peace Agreement reached between the parties to the crisis  in South Sudan and to plead for the implementation of the commitments made for a political and definitive solution  to the ongoing conflict in that country. As    a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council, we believe that further cooperation between United Nations peacekeeping structures and the operational mechanisms of the African Union and the subregions is an urgent necessity.\nThe resolution adopted by the General Assembly last June during the biennial review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy reminds us of that imperative (resolution 72/284). In that regard, the Togolese Government welcomes the holding of the\nfirst Joint Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Economic Community of Central African States on Peace, Security, Stability and the Fight against Terrorism and Violent Extremism, in Lom\u00e9,  on 30 July, during Togo\u2019s term as Chairman-in-Office of the Assembly of Heads of  State and  Government of ECOWAS. That meeting, the first of  its  kind on the continent, organized at the initiative of the two subregions, made it possible to create a framework for exchanges on preventive and operational conditions for the preservation and maintenance of a lasting peace in the common space of the two communities.\nIn order for the United Nations to assert its leadership and play its role effectively and fully as a guarantor of international peace and stability, it is essential to continue and complete the Security Council reform process. The reform of the Organization will be complete only if it also involves the reform of the Security Council. The new approach is based on a shared vision of responsibilities and recommends that solutions to international peace and security problems should be the prerogative of all States Members of the United Nations. In that way, the expanded Security Council would, in the interest of equitable representation and the involvement of all regions of the world, contribute to making the Council more effective in fulfilling its important mission. Although my country welcomes the consultations held throughout this year,  which have enabled States and groups to  make  proposals and enrich the discussions, there is reason to wonder about the outcome of the negotiation process, which has obviously been stalled for 28 years.\nAt the national level,  Togo\u2019s  action  is  part  of the shared commitment of States Members of the United Nations to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Government\u2019s main objective is to make Togo a middle-income country that is economically, socially and democratically stable and open to the world\u2019s demands. The recently adopted national development programme, which is consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, ECOWAS Vision 2020 and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, aims to structurally transform the national economy for sustainable, inclusive and resilient growth. Togo is working to improve the quality of life of its citizens and to contribute, alongside the United Nations, to reducing pockets of insecurity in our changing world. In that regard, I would like to express my gratitude to the development partners that have\n \nalready come forward to support my country in that ambitious and burdensome task.\nSustainable development also promotes the development  of  human  rights.  The   establishment of a  fair and free society depends on  the building of  a peaceful and secure world. In that regard, Togo is resolutely pursuing its constitutional and institutional reform process with a view to consolidating democratic gains and guaranteeing rights and freedoms for all. In that perspective, the Government has launched efforts to find a definitive and lasting solution to the political misunderstandings that we have experienced in recent months, by continuing to bring together the political class and civil society to share views on the common challenges and objectives of peace and social and human progress.\nIn the spirit of  regional  solidarity,  ECOWAS has been helping Togo to overcome its political difficulties. That noble regional organization, through the facilitation of Ghana and Guinea, has helped the Togolese political class agree on the joint composition of the Independent National Electoral Commission with a view to the scheduled holding of legislative elections on 20 December 2018.\nThe late former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, who passed away last month and to whom we pay a well-deserved and grateful tribute for his admirable commitment to the service of peace in the world, said on 24 September 2001: \u201cThe only route that offers any hope of a better future for all humanity is that of cooperation and partnership\u201d (A/56/PV.7, p. 2). Together we will be able to build the world that we want to leave to future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "We live in challenging times. This year\u2019s theme, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, is therefore most appropriate. It serves to remind us of the need to strengthen the role of this important Organization if we wish to overcome the complex challenges we face today. In that process, we must not forget the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including the principle of sovereign equality. It is also important to remember that the promotion of economic, social, cultural and humanitarian interests, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, can be attained only through international cooperation. Furthermore, we should not forget the international character of the United Nations.\nIt is only through constructive and peaceful approaches that we will be able to create a better United Nations \u2014 one that is relevant to all nations. Only then can our hopes for global leadership with shared responsibilities become a reality. Here I wish to stress that Myanmar\u2019s view on the role of the United Nations remains unchanged. There is no suitable multilateral platform other than the United Nations where countries can work together to find solutions to overcome global challenges.\nLet me apprise the Assembly of our efforts to transform Myanmar from an authoritarian  system into a democratic one and of our efforts to  bring  about sustainable development and build a society where stability, peace and harmony prevail. A country without peace and stability cannot achieve economic development. Of that we are convinced. Accordingly, our democratically elected Government has given priority to national reconciliation and peace since we assumed office.\nWe are convinced that ethnic strife and armed conflicts in Myanmar can be ended only through political means. Lasting peace will become a reality only when the democratic federal union to which our people have aspired is established. We are therefore conducting negotiations at the Union Peace Conference to reach agreement on the fundamental principles for  a democratic federal union. The three sessions of the conference held so far have resulted in the  adoption  of 51 fundamental principles that will become part of the Union Peace Accord. To  ensure that the process   is inclusive, we have continued negotiations not only with the eight ethnic armed groups that have signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement but also with those that have yet to come on board.\nDuring the past year, two more ethnic armed groups, namely, the New Mon State Party and the Lahu Democratic Union, joined the peace process by signing the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement. We will continue our endeavours to bring all ethnic armed organizations\n \nunder the umbrella of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement and to the conference table.\nEssential to our endeavours to bring peace and prosperity to the nation is the need to ensure balanced development in the economic, social and environmental spheres. To that end, the Government has adopted the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan 2018\u20132030, which is in accord with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Among its important goals are peace, national reconciliation, security and good governance. The success of the Plan requires not only national endeavours but also the involvement and commitment of development partners and international organizations.\nHuman rights and inclusiveness are fundamental to the successful transformation of Myanmar into a democratic society. The Government has spared no effort to nurture democratic norms and practices among all its citizens. Those efforts include the promotion of the rule of law,  good governance and the protection  of human rights, and the fostering of  civil  society.  All those elements are essential for the emergence of  a democratic federal union in which the security and prosperity of all citizens are ensured. It is a supremely challenging task, particularly for a fledgling democracy. However, Myanmar is strong in its resolution to build the democratic society to which our people aspire.\nResolving the issue in Rakhine state is an important component of our democratic process. Our Government has consistently exerted all possible efforts to bring peace and development to Rakhine. Within weeks of assuming the responsibilities of governing, the Government set up the Central Committee for the Implementation of Peace, Stability and Development  in  Rakhine  state in May 2016 under the chairmanship of the State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. That was followed by the establishment of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State in September 2016, headed by the late Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, to provide recommendations for bringing peace, stability and development to Rakhine state.\nI wish at this point to pay tribute to Kofi Annan, who with his immense wisdom provided us with recommendations in his desire for us to reach our goal of peace, prosperity and security.\nBarely a month after the Advisory Commission was established, an extremist terrorist group, called Aga Mul Mujahidin \u2014 later renamed the Arakan Rohingya\nSalvation Army \u2014 launched attacks on three border police posts in northern Rakhine state. The attacks were premeditated, well organized and designed to invoke fear among the inhabitants, as well as to incite violence and attract international attention.\nThe Government, despite the attacks, continued with its efforts to seek sustainable solutions for Rakhine state. The Advisory Commission presented its final report to the Government of Myanmar in August 2017. It contains 88 recommendations towards achieving lasting peace and stability in Rakhine. We have  set  up an implementation committee, and I am happy to report that we are now implementing 81 out of the 88 recommendations made by the Commission.\nWithin hours of the release of the Advisory Commission\u2019s final report, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army terrorists carried out simultaneous attacks on 30 police outposts and one army battalion headquarters. Here, it must be stressed that the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacks of 2017 were not only against the security forces but also against various communities inhabiting Rakhine state. The attacks opened a chapter of fear and instability that led to a large outflow of refugees to Bangladesh. International attention has been focused on the outflow but has overlooked the broader picture of the various reasons \u2014 immediate as well as long-standing \u2014 that brought about the displacement of those people. Nevertheless, the Government has persisted in its sincere efforts to address as a whole the need for stability, reconciliation and the development of all communities in Rakhine.\nWe deeply sympathize with these displaced persons, especially the women  and children,  and have taken steps to effect the early repatriation of all displaced persons from Rakhine who are verified as residents of the State. To that end, we have signed three bilateral agreements with Bangladesh. In line with these bilateral agreements, the necessary preparations have been made, and we have been ready to receive verified returnees from Bangladesh since 23 January. We call on Bangladesh to fulfil its commitments in accordance with these bilateral agreements so as to allow without delay the return of verified persons under voluntary, safe and dignified conditions. A number of people have returned of their own volition, having made their own arrangements. They have been systematically registered and processed and are now with their relatives and families in their own homes. However, not even a single displaced person has been repatriated by Bangladesh as\n \npart of the implementation of the bilateral agreement. The only way to resolve the issue swiftly and peacefully is through the implementation of bilateral agreements, working together in the spirit of good-neighbourliness and refraining from activities that might be inimical to the national interests of either Myanmar or Bangladesh.\nWe recognize the crucial role of the United Nations in addressing the issue of Rakhine. Accordingly, the Government of Myanmar signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with a view to assisting the speedy and efficient resettlement and rehabilitation of returnees. The United Nations team has started this process, and we are looking forward to its feedback.\nThe Myanmar Government has expressed its serious concerns over the report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar published by the Human Rights Council on 12 September (A/HRC/39/64). Due to our Government\u2019s serious and genuine concerns about the advisability of fact-finding mission\u2019s establishment, composition and mandate, Myanmar objected to the mission\u2019s creation from the very beginning, At a time when we are working hard to build harmony on the ground, we are concerned that the release of the report, which is based on narratives and not on hard evidence \u2014 a point which I energetically emphasize \u2014 will serve only to further inflame tensions and could potentially hinder our efforts to create the much-needed social cohesion in Rakhine. In this regard, I would like to stress what accountability should mean to all of us. Accountability should mean taking responsibility for one\u2019s actions. Accountability must apply equally to all. Individuals, organizations and national Governments \u2014 as well as multilateral organizations \u2014 must be held responsible for the consequences of their words and actions.\nAs the Assembly will also be aware, the Government of Myanmar has resolutely rejected the International Criminal Court\u2019s 6 September ruling in connection with Rakhine state. Our position in this regard is clear: Myanmar is not a party to the Rome Statute, and the Court has no jurisdiction whatsoever over my country. The Court\u2019s decision was made on dubious legal grounds and applied to a situation where domestic remedies had not yet been exhausted. I speak to all delegations today when I say that we, the members of the international community, should be deeply concerned by the recent decision of the International Criminal Court and the\nvarious precedents that the Court may be setting by this ruling, as well as by the way in which it was made. Such action can only erode the moral  and  legal  authority of the Court. We are heartened that we are not  alone in having grave misgivings about the Court. I would also like to make it clear that, while the Government is unable to accept this legally dubious intervention by the International Criminal Court, we are fully committed to ensuring accountability where there is concrete evidence of human rights violations committed in Rakhine state.\nWe have recently established an independent commission of inquiry  that will investigate all violations of human rights and atrocities committed  in Rakhine state as part of our efforts to address the issues of accountability, reconciliation, peace, stability and development in our country. The Commission is chaired by Ms. Rosario Manalo, former Deputy Foreign Minister of the Philippines, and comprises Ambassador Kenzo Oshima, former Japanese Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Under- Secretary-General of the United Nations, and two Myanmar nationals, one of whom is a former Chairman of the Constitutional Tribunal and the other a former senior official of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. We hope that, alongside the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, the work of the independent commission of inquiry will become an important guiding light for the resolution of problems in Rakhine state.\nThe challenges facing Myanmar are complex and multifaceted. However, the people of Myanmar are resilient. We stand united to face all obstacles and to meet all challenges as we strive to bring peace, development and national harmony to our country, which has suffered from decades of conflict, underdevelopment and disharmony.\n"

        "file_text": "We are all proud members of this venerable institution. If this place and our membership in it stand for anything, then we stand for an international order based on rules and cooperation. That principle guides our actions, our dealings with each other, and our treatment of collective challenges as they arise before us. Australia recognizes the reality of a world in which the power of great States shapes the international system in which we seek to advance our national interests. That is the grain with which we all work.\nWe also hold true to the following simple proposition \u2014 we will be safer and more prosperous  in a world where global differences are managed and global challenges met by agreed rules rather than by the exercise of power alone. Strong global cooperation sets a tone and sets in place rules and norms for constructive diplomacy in every region of the world. That is true even in a period of rapid and accelerating change and of rising nationalism and geopolitical\n \ncompetition. Our most urgent global challenges will not be solved by countries acting alone; solutions begin with collaboration.\nIn Australia\u2019s 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, we set out an analysis of the trends that are shaping the world. Most importantly, we set out our policy response. In a very competitive and contested era, Australia is taking responsibility for its own security and prosperity. At home, we are investing in our national resilience and strength, ensuring that our economy is strong and that Australians are safe. We are sovereign and independent. In our region \u2014 the Indo- Pacific \u2014 we seek a neighbourhood in which the rights of all States are respected, and in which adherence to rules delivers lasting peace. Internationally, we are committed to promoting and protecting the rules and institutions that support stability and prosperity, and enable collective action to meet global challenges.\nAt this time of change, challenge and opportunity, we representatives of Member States have the honour of preserving and advancing international rules and order so as to deliver on the expectations of our people for a just, fair and secure world. One proof of the necessity of the United Nations is the hard fact that we cannot, with all confidence, rid the world of nuclear weapons \u2014 not today or this year.\nGiven that reality, we  must redouble our efforts  to prevent nuclear proliferation and to build the international trust and confidence necessary to move towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Our peoples expect us to continue to work towards verifiable nuclear disarmament with sound compliance, safeguards and enforcement regimes. Overwhelmingly, our peoples expect us to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons. To do that, we must  continue to  build  on the progress we have made through the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nFor that reason, Australia supports the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, as long as Iran abides by its commitments. It is in our collective interest that controls on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme remain in place. And for that reason, the world watches with anticipation the negotiations between the United States and North Korea, pursuing the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the peninsula, in accordance with United Nations resolutions.\nAustralia will also continue to fully implement our obligations under Security Council resolutions  and maintain our own autonomous sanctions, while awaiting real progress towards denuclearization. In addition, we have most recently witnessed a new pattern of indiscriminate slaughter through the  use  of chemical weapons, including the weaponization of toxic industrial chemicals such as chlorine. We have collectively agreed that the use of chemical weapons anytime, anywhere and under any circumstances is unjustifiable and unacceptable.\nAs Member States, we must defend our long- standing prohibition on the use of chemical weapons and be prepared to abide by our collective right and resolve to investigate allegations and to verify compliance with that prohibition. Australia joins those calling for Syria to cease the use of chemicals as weapons. Australia also continues to urge Russia and all nations to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons anywhere.\nAustralia, like the United Nations, is committed to improving humanitarian assistance in fragile settings. I commend the Secretary-General for establishing the United for Gender Parity initiative, and for declaring zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse. Australia is also a robust and  strong contributor to  the Organization\u2019s women and peace and security agenda, first set out in Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). Australia was one of the first Member States  to draw up a national action plan on women and peace and security, and we are continuing work on our next five-year national action plan.\nExamples of our work on that issue include a benchmark of a minimum of 15 per cent of female military members deployed on Australian peacekeeping mission teams, which I was proud to support over the past three years in my previous role as Australia\u2019s Minister for Defence. Australia also has active training programmes on women and peace and security in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Philippines, where our military is assisting partner forces to deal with counter- terrorism and counter-insurgency challenges.\nAustralia firmly believes that it is only through the inclusion of women in all aspects of peace and security initiatives, including negotiations, the design of peace processes and the management and enforcement of peace programmes, that lasting and resilient security can be achieved.\n \nMany here will remember my predecessor and friend Julie Bishop\u2019s determined and sustained work pursuing accountability for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17. Australia remains resolutely committed to that objective, and we will continue working with our Joint Investigation Team partners to pursue justice for the victims and their loved ones.\nIn expecting other Member States to abide by international rules, we must also subject ourselves to those same standards and expectations. On 6 March, here in New York,  Australia and Timor-Leste signed  a new maritime boundaries treaty.  The  treaty  was the successful result of the first-ever compulsory conciliation initiated under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It underscores Australia\u2019s commitment to  international  law  and  is a testament to the  way  in  which  international  law, in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, enables countries to resolve disputes peacefully and properly, abiding by the rules. The conciliation process created the space for compromise and negotiation on what I acknowledge was a previously intractable disagreement, and ultimately strengthened bilateral relations.\nWhen Member States work together to uphold international law and the institutions that support it, the benefits accrue to all alike \u2014 the powerful and the weak, the large and the small. That is a long-standing principle that all we share, regardless of our culture, language, religion or political system. We are all equal before the law.\nAustralia particularly welcomes the active engagement of the United Nations in our region, the Indo-Pacific. It is a dynamic region that in recent decades has experienced an economic transformation that is unprecedented in human history. The region\u2019s rising prosperity has been built on a strong foundation of stability. Australia is absolutely committed to ensuring that the fundamental principles that have enabled the region\u2019s success are maintained.\nWe are committed to a region in which the rights of all States are respected, where there is respect for international law and other norms, where disputes are resolved peacefully, and where open markets facilitate the free flow of trade, capital and ideas. In order to achieve those outcomes, Australia is strengthening its Indo-Pacific bilateral relations, because they are among our most important in their own right and because strong\nbilateral relations help us support our regional goals. Our aid programme is an important mechanism through which we support the aspirations of our neighbours. It is predominately and unashamedly focused on the Indo- Pacific region, and geared to  expand  opportunities for people, businesses and communities to promote economic growth and further reduce regional poverty.\nWe work in sectors that drive economic growth and human development, including aid for trade, infrastructure, education and health, and the empowerment of women and girls. And we work in ways that are most effective, including with United Nations resident coordinators, and through the region\u2019s political, security and economic architecture.\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) sits at the heart of our region. It is the collective voice of South-East Asia. There are good reasons why Australia is ASEAN\u2019s longest-standing dialogue partner. We are both committed to driving continued strong regional economic growth, and we share optimism for the future. At the same time, we share a conviction of the need to tackle head-on the security challenges of our region, including the fight against terrorism. As the convener for more than 50 years of the Indo-Pacific\u2019s most important diplomatic architecture, particularly the East Asia Summit, ASEAN plays a vital role in the security, stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Australia\u2019s interests are well served by ASEAN, and our commitment to its continued effectiveness and success is stronger than ever.\nThat commitment was there for all to see at the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit, held in Sydney in March. The Summit marked a new era in the strategic partnership between ASEAN and Australia. Leaders issued the Sydney Declaration, which comprehensively sets out ASEAN and Australia\u2019s shared commitment to working together towards a more secure and prosperous region.\nIn other key pieces of regional architecture, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum seeks to build upon the growing interdependence of the Asia- Pacific\u2019s 21 member economies. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  forum  meeting  in  Papua New Guinea in November will provide an important opportunity to foster cooperation and economic activity across borders to the mutual benefit of all. I commend Papua New Guinea for the significant work that it has done to host the 2018 forum, and I look forward in\n \nparticular to a very successful Leaders\u2019 Week in Port Moresby later this year.\nI also commend our Pacific neighbour, the Republic of Nauru, for its successful hosting of the 49th Pacific Islands Forum in the first week of September. With the theme of \u201cBuilding a strong Pacific: our islands, our people, our will\u201d, the member States, associate members, observers and dialogue partners of the Pacific Islands Forum continued the long tradition of amity, consultation, partnership and policy development on diverse matters such as climate change, economic reform, transport and trade.\nAustralia is committed to working with States members of the Pacific Islands Forum and United Nations resident coordinators to strengthen resilience to climate change and natural disasters in the Pacific. The United Nations Development Programme is  a vital partner in that effort. Australia recognizes that Pacific island countries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and disaster, and that that problem is a leading priority for the region. The Pacific Islands Forum Boe Declaration, released last month at the meeting by member States, takes a contemporary view of security, inclusive of human and environmental security, and emphasizes the importance of regional cooperation and collaboration in building resilience to disasters and climate change.\nIn 2018, Australia joined the Human Rights Council for the first time. In the Council Australia works for and seeks to develop a region that promotes accountability and respects international law for the benefit of all \u2014 nations and people. Australia has been a strong supporter of the Independent International Fact-finding Mission on Myanmar, and we have been deeply disturbed by its findings. We  are  working with Myanmar and with ASEAN and regional and international partners  to find  long-term  solutions  to that  complex  crisis,  including  with  Indonesia   as co-chairs of the Bali Process and through joint humanitarian efforts in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Australia will continue to work with the Myanmar Government and the international community to achieve a long-term and durable resolution of Myanmar\u2019s complex problems. After 50 years of isolation and instability, Myanmar  is at a critical stage in its democratic and economic transition, and it  is in all our interests to ensure that   it succeeds. Let us honour the late former Secretary- General, Kofi Annan, by renewing our efforts to see fully and genuinely implemented the recommendations\nof the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, which he so ably led.\nInternational institutions, and the United Nations in particular, help us to adapt collectively as our world changes around us. But as Secretary-General Guterres noted when he opened the General Assembly earlier this week:\n\u201c[t]rust in global governance is also fragile, as twenty-first-century challenges outpace twentieth- century institutions and mindsets\u201d (A/73/PV.6, p.1).\nThat is why Australia supports the Secretary- General\u2019s efforts to reform the United Nations. We need to work  together to keep pace with the needs  and aspirations of the people we serve. But in order to remain fit for our times, the United Nations must remain true to the founding principles, the universal rights and obligations that we agreed upon when we first came together as Member States. Chief among them is the sovereign equality of all States. Member States must rededicate themselves to the aspirations of the founders of the Organization and take to heart the Charter of the United Nations, so that our world can indeed be a more just, fair and secure place to live.\n"

        "file_text": "In 1999, in his message for the New Millennium, the late Kofi Annan spoke words that still ring true almost two decades later:\n\u201cMore than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.\u201d\nMr. Annan\u2019s legacy is one of international cooperation, and of fighting illiteracy, poverty, inequality and climate change as root causes of conflict and human rights violations. Above all, his is a legacy of hope, and a firm belief that progress is  the unifying theme in human history. The Millennium Development Goals proved him right, and it is up to us, the leaders of the united nations of the world, to carry this legacy forward and make the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement a reality.\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands remains firmly committed  to international  cooperation.  In   fact, we have enshrined the principle in Article 90 of our\n \nConstitution, which states that \u201cthe Government shall promote the development of the international legal order\u201d. That provision reflects our moral compass, but it also reflects our history as an open, seafaring and trading nation, and the fact that our Kingdom consists of four countries, in Europe and the Caribbean: Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, the Netherlands and Sint Maarten. We have therefore understood for many centuries the necessity and benefits of a transnational outlook.\nThat is my core message today. We need a transnational outlook to master the challenges we  face. There is no conflict between multilateralism and national interest, but rather the contrary. After all, what country does not benefit from a stable and secure international environment, free and fair world trade, peace instead of armed conflict, prosperity instead of poverty, and equality instead of inequality? And what country can achieve those goals alone?\nThose are rhetorical questions, of course, but once we acknowledge that, and we should act in consequence, which means we must embrace multilateralism. To the people of the Kingdom of the Netherlands this has only become more evident in the aftermath of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. It remains an open wound for my country, and for all  grieving nations that had nationals on board. We are grateful for the support of the international community, as expressed in Security Council resolution 2166 (2014). We hope that together we will see justice done.\nIn May, the Joint Investigation Team presented conclusive evidence about the origin of the missile launcher that was used to down the aircraft. This has only bolstered our resolve that, in the interest of the victims and their loved ones, the full truth must be revealed, justice served and responsibility accepted.  In accordance with Security Council resolution 2166 (2014), we call on all States to fully cooperate with ongoing efforts to this end.\nThere can be no doubt that the rules-based multilateral order that arose after the Second World War has brought great things to many people. That goes especially for the United Nations and the General Assembly. And yet, for many other countries and peoples, the global order has not brought the same benefits. In many parts of the world, peace, stability and prosperity cannot be taken for granted.\nThe multilateral system is therefore not perfect, and it is under pressure. The playing field is changing\nas we speak. Some countries, for a range of reasons, have begun to embrace a different approach. Sadly, more and more often, compromise is being rejected in favour of polarization and perceived self-interest. We are witnessing a worrisome trend: some countries are shifting from a constructive to a combative approach in the multilateral environment. What is more, rising repression, human rights violations and shrinking freedom worldwide are a grave concern. Accountability is often lacking. And when the multilateral system becomes paralysed, it is innocent people who suffer.\nSyria is a case in point. In  his  most recent annual report, Secretary-General Guterres wrote that \u201cworking together multilaterally is not optional; it is the only answer\u201d (A/73/1, para. 148). I fully agree. I believe in constructive multilateralism. I believe  in the power of principle, not the principle of power, to guide us towards a better future for more people. Our best \u2014 perhaps even our only \u2014 way forward is not to give in to defeatism and cynicism but to keep working to improve the system, step by step.\nIn that regard, let me emphasize once again that the Kingdom of the Netherlands firmly supports the Secretary-General\u2019s reform agenda and that we applaud its initial results. The recent agreement on United Nations reform sends a strong message of broad support for change. But, as always, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Now we have to put words into action, and by \u201cwe\u201d I mean the United Nations itself and all the Member States.\nThe United Nations system must be made fit for purpose to deliver on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, which is the ultimate prevention agenda. Take, for example, the staggering number of 3,000 separate United Nations offices around the world, which is 3,000 arguments that support those who say that multilateralism just creates fragmentation and bureaucracy. The critics are not entirely wrong: United Nations reform should bring down this number by at least a thousand, through co-location, use of shared premises and services, and stronger collaboration. That is a thousand arguments for improving multilateralism, and that is just one example of the broader effort that is required to help the Secretary-General\u2019s reform drive succeed.\nAnother important initiative is the Secretary- General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping agenda. Peacekeeping is at the heart of the United Nations, and\n \nwe need to keep that instrument up to date. Reforms within the Secretariat and in missions in the field, like the introduction of rotation schemes, will help make peacekeeping missions more effective. For their part, Member States will have to match their words with deeds and money. Supporting change is not a free lunch.\nThat is why, for example, the Kingdom of the Netherlands was the first Member State to announce funding for a reformed resident coordinator system that will raise the efficiency of the United Nations development system. It is why  today  I  transferred  the intellectual property rights of the Dutch Travel Information Portal to the United Nations. That system, which maps the travel movements of terrorists and organized crime syndicates, will now be accessible to all Member States. It is practical steps like those that improve the United Nations, our United Nations.\nWhen we look at the United Nations institutions, we must not mince our words. We must tell it like it is. Sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment committed by people working for United Nations missions and organizations is unacceptable in every case and in every place. There are no exceptions. That kind of misconduct undermines the core principles of the United Nations and \u2014 as the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out \u2014 zero tolerance is the only possible response. We must put the new policies in place without hesitation and act on them. We must make sure that victims feel heard and supported and that whistle-blowers are protected. The United Nations is meant to save and improve lives, not destroy them. Here we must draw a clear line.\nOf course, improving the multilateral system is not only about institutions and organizing principles. They are only a means to an end. Above all, it is about what we do and why we do it. Over the years, we have gradually learned that the only way to solve problems is to tackle their root causes. We have learned that systematically reducing poverty demands more than money alone, that ending an armed conflict takes more than Blue Helmets alone, that gender equality and education are essential for peace and development, and that sustainability, climate resilience and international stability go hand in hand. The Sustainable Development Goals are built on that concept of integrated thinking and action.\nThat brings me to a topic that is very important to me personally and to the Kingdom of the Netherlands: water management and adaptation to climate change.\nThe global water crisis affects us all, in the form of increasing droughts, floods or pollution. As a member of the former High-level Panel on Water, I hope that the agenda for water action we presented earlier this year will inspire others to scale up their action on water. We need to give the value of water greater weight in the economic, social, environmental and other choices we make.\nFor the Kingdom of the Netherlands, that is self- evident. Amsterdam airport is the only airport in the world that lies below sea level \u2014 over four metres below sea level, in fact. So those present can imagine that rising sea levels and the increase in extreme weather are of serious concern to us, as they are for the Caribbean parts of our Kingdom, which are especially vulnerable during the hurricane season.\nIt goes without saying that we welcome the recent announcement of the new Global Commission on Adaptation. We are proud to be hosting the launch event in my home town of The Hague on 16 October. Of course, we look forward to next year\u2019s climate summit in New York because it should provide a platform to delve deeper into the links among climate resilience, financing and security. Climate and water are, by their nature, issues that can be dealt with only multilaterally, using an integrated approach. The Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 set clear objectives. However, water cuts across all the SDGs. What we need now is international transparency, fair market mechanisms and a level playing field so that all countries can do their part in adapting to climate change.\nDuring last year\u2019s election of Netherlands United Nations youth representatives, the young candidates were asked what global issue they would address first if elected. Members of the Assembly might expect an answer like world peace, eradicating poverty or ending war. But one of them said:\n\u201cI would tackle cynicism first. We can change things, but we have to believe  we  can,  roll  up our sleeves and get  started.  Cynicism  will  get us nowhere.\u201d\nWe all should take inspiration from those words. It is easy to be cynical and criticize the multilateral system. It is harder to make improvements and reforms that will take us forward, step by step. But constructive multilateralism is the only way to make progress. That is what we are working for, and not only as a member of the Security Council until 31 December, but also\n \nafterwards and in other international forums. To that end, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will stand as a candidate for the Human Rights Council for the 2020- 2022 term. We will proceed in the spirit of Kofi Annan, who once said that we need to keep hope alive and strive to do better.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me warmly welcome everyone on behalf of the freedom- loving, ancient Kyrgyz people, with their thousands of years of history and great mountains. From this lofty rostrum of the United Nations, I would like to draw everyone\u2019s attention to the issues that the Kyrgyz Republic believes to be urgent and that require joint solutions at the national, regional and international levels. On behalf of the Kyrgyz Republic, I would like to salute all participants in the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nThe global political, economic and environmental situation is changing rapidly, and the trend towards regionalism in world politics is increasing. Rising\n \nprices, insufficient liquidity and sanctions wars in economies continue. The threat of terrorism and extremism is everywhere. The preservation of an environmental balance has become a global issue for the whole planet. Regardless of their causes, those issues affect every country, especially small ones with open economies. These processes have become sensitive issues for Kyrgyzstan. I therefore believe that today it is extremely timely to discuss in the General Assembly the relevance of the United Nations to all people, as well as the issues of global leadership and mutual responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. I would like to take this opportunity from the high tribune of the United Nations to outline the issues at the national, regional and global levels that are of relevance to our country.\nThe peaceful transfer of power in the autumn of 2017 laid a solid foundation for Kyrgyzstan\u2019s further progressive democratic development. At present, there is political and social stability in Kyrgyzstan, which provides us with the opportunity to set ambitious  goals for the medium term. Kyrgyzstan supports the development of a system of parliamentary democracy in our country, and the upcoming 2020 parliamentary elections will attest to that once again. We firmly believe that parliamentary democracy is best suited to the nature of our society\u2019s development.\nThe fight against corruption remains a  priority for the State policy of Kyrgyzstan. As of today, we are facing the issues of the political modernization and economic development that the future will require of us.\nFirst of all, we are focusing on implementing judicial and legal reforms and reorganizing our law- enforcement agencies. The sustainable  development of every region of Kyrgyzstan is key to successful development and is our most urgent issue. We  have  set ourselves the goal of improving the climate for investment and have begun building an information society with a fair and transparent public administration. Kyrgyzstan will continue to consistently strengthen democratic principles in developing the State. Our public administration is focused on the needs of all individuals and on ensuring their rights, freedoms and justice in society.\nAll of these  medium-  and long-term  reforms  are included in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s 2040 national development strategy. The long-term provisions  of our national development strategy meet all of the\nrequirements of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and in that connection, we hope for further support from the United Nations and partner countries for Kyrgyzstan\u2019s development efforts. Kyrgyzstan remains committed to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe consider strengthening  the  entire  spectrum of cooperation among the countries of Central Asia a crucial factor in ensuring the security not only of the region but of the world. We are pleased to note that  our cooperation has gained positive momentum and reached a fundamentally new level. The meetings of the Heads of State and Foreign Ministers of the countries of Central Asia have become a tradition.\nFor  the Kyrgyz Republic, the issue of  water use is extremely important. The ways that water and energy resources have been used  in  recent  decades in Central Asia show how essential it is to develop  new approaches. We believe  that  the  integrated use of water and energy resources in the region should be determined by a system of measures aimed at achieving the sustainable development of all Central Asian States. Kyrgyzstan has therefore consistently advocated for the development and implementation in Central Asia of mutually beneficial economic mechanisms in the area. Cooperation and multilateral dialogue are considered by the Kyrgyz Republic as the only way to solve existing challenges. In that context, we also see a special role and a new mission  for  regional  organizations  such as the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Eurasian Economic Union. Ending isolationist policies and developing the cooperation and partnership have become very important today.\nNo State is immune to threats related to terrorism and extremism. The members of the international community must work together more actively to combat this evil and problems such as drug trafficking, trafficking in persons and weapons, money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. That is very important to us, as we are located at a crossroads of drug- trafficking networks. Regrettably, the measures taken by the international community are still insufficient.  It is important to pay special attention to solving this general problem for the region. Kyrgyzstan reaffirms its commitment to the effective implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  and supports the Joint Action Plan. It is essential to\n \ncoordinate the efforts of the States of the region on issues related to security, improved cooperation and the exchange of operating information. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has approved a programme  for combating extremism and terrorism up to 2022. I thank the United Nations for its financial and technical assistance in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking, and we hope for further support from development partners for security-related issues.\nThe move towards sustainable development means restoring our natural ecosystems and the environment. Kyrgyzstan recognizes climate change as an existential threat to ecosystems and people. We committed to counteracting that global threat by signing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Climate change is having an ever-increasing impact on our glaciers and water resources and contributing to the increase in natural disasters in our mountainous regions. Those are the main topics of the fourth World Mountain Forum in Kyrgyzstan, held to discuss new paths to development ensuring a prosperous future for mountain regions.\nThe main environment-related issue in our region continues to be the legacy of the radioactive materials industry of the Soviet era \u2014 that is, uranium tailings. Kyrgyzstan has held a number of international conferences in an effort to find solutions to it. We  held an event at the United Nations on 27 September dedicated to the dangers of uranium mining. With the aim of reaching a new stage in action for reclaiming uranium tailings, Kyrgyzstan is taking the initiative to update resolution 68/218 on the role of the international community in averting the radiation threat in Central Asia. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our development partners for providing significant support to my country in solving this problem.\nThe issues I have noted require the  joint  efforts of all States and of global and regional institutions. There is a growing need  to  create  fundamentally new international mechanisms, adequate to modern challenges and threats. Our Organization needs changes to meet the demands of the times and current realities. Its reforms should be based on the principles of universality, broad geographical representation and the widest possible support of the States Members of the United Nations. Kyrgyzstan seeks  to  contribute its fair share of  contributions to the common cause   of the United Nations for peace, global security and sustainable development.\nIn order to draw the attention of the United Nations and the world to the problem of small States, Kyrgyzstan has put forward its candidacy for a  seat  as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period from 2027 to 2028. The support of countries that have never had a seat on the Council will increase confidence in the equality of its members and thereby raise and strengthen the authority and credibility of the Organization. Kyrgyzstan considers the United Nations to be an authoritative and universal international organization.\nIt should be emphasized that an important factor in preserving peace, stability and the development of cultural diversity and tolerance is the deepening of intercultural dialogue. That was brilliantly described in the works of our distinguished and world-renowned writer Chingiz Aitmatov. He made a significant contribution to building peace and cultural exchange among different peoples. This year, Kyrgyzstan and the whole world are celebrating the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Chingiz Aitmatov.\nThe initiative of Kyrgyzstan to hold the World Nomad Games on a regular basis has been recognized and supported by the General Assembly. The Games have shown that, despite the complexities and contradictions of the modern world, the peoples of the world strive for unity and creativity.\nOur nation considers independence to be its greatest achievement, and it has found its worthy place in the world community. Kyrgyzstan has been recognized as a sovereign State in the international arena. As Chingiz Aitmatov, the great son of the Kyrgyz people and a famous writer, philosopher and humanist said, \u201cThere is no greater wealth for man than to live together and in peace\u201d.\nOnly unity and harmony will save  the  world.  The unity of the people is the main guarantor of the sustainable development of our country. Inter-ethnic friendship in society and the responsible attitude of all citizens to their country\u2019s destiny are the foundations of success. The independence of Kyrgyzstan and the unity of its people are our future and happiness. May God grant his mercy to the people of Kyrgyzstan and let peace reign in our land. I wish every citizen of the country health, good fortune, and a happy and peaceful life. Long live our independent Kyrgyzstan.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session on her election and wish her success in her tasks. I also thank His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for his efforts during the previous session and commend Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his efforts, especially his reform project at the helm of our international Organization.\nThe theme that the President has suggested for this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, is commendable because it demonstrates that the United Nations understands that its present reality requires a serious improvement in its future role. According to its purposes and founding principles, the United Nations must be the global conscience that preserves balance, prevents aggression, achieves justice and protects peace. However, we have seen that on many occasions the Security Council has been unable to adopt just and sometimes decisive resolutions pertaining to certain peoples, due to the right of veto. Some States refuse to implement resolutions that they deem to be inappropriate, and do so with impunity, even if those resolutions are binding and of immediate effect. I will cite some examples related to the suffering of our region.\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), which called on Israel to immediately withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territories, was implemented only after 22  years, and  that was due  to  the  resistance of\nthe Lebanese people. General Assembly resolution  181 (II), of 1947, concerning the partition of Palestine, was seen as being of a binding nature although it was not, and it was implemented instantly. Meanwhile, resolution 194 (III), of 1948, which provided for the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland as soon as possible, remains unimplemented 70 years after its adoption. Evidently, the right of veto exists for many reasons; however, its use has had a negative impact on many States and peoples, especially in our region, and denied them their legitimate rights.\nConsequently, if the United Nations is to be a global leaders that is relevant to all people, it must be reformed in a way that takes into consideration the expansion of the Security  Council  and  an  increase in the number of  its members. It  must also work  in   a more transparent, democratic and balanced way. Furthermore, it is important for the General Assembly to more closely reflect the actual orientation of the international community.\nThe United Nations is also called on to enhance human rights around the world. Lebanon, which contributed significantly to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is committed to the Declaration in the preamble of its Constitution. We underscore the freedom of the individual in society, and stress that any violation of human rights in any country could lead to conflicts in the future.\nIn that regard, we would like to state that Lebanon is steadily moving forward in promoting human rights at both the legislative and the executive levels. The Lebanese Parliament has adopted a law establishing a national committee on human rights, which includes the formation of a committee to investigate allegations of torture and mistreatment. In that context, we are completing a national action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), which calls on  Member States to put  in place action plans to empower women to take part in decision-making, negotiation processes and in efforts to address conflicts. The Lebanese action plan guarantees the participation of women in the decision-making process at all levels, and activates their role in preventing conflicts, while enacting laws to prevent discrimination against women and protect them from violence and exploitation.\nIn Lebanon, we are trying to mitigate the effects of consecutive conflicts around us. At the security level, we have managed to improve our security and\n \nstability after having eradicated terrorist groups in the eastern and northern rural areas and dismantled their sleeper cells.\nIn terms of politics, Lebanon held parliamentary elections in accordance with a law of proportionality for the first time. That has led to a fairer representation of all components of Lebanese society. Today, we are in the process of forming a cabinet that is reflective of the election results.\nIn terms of the economy, we have established guidelines for an economic recovery plan that takes into consideration the outcomes of the Economic Conference for Development through Reforms with the Private Sector in order to activate the production sectors, update the infrastructure and bridge the gap between income and expenditure in our budget.\nNevertheless, we are still facing the consequences of events in Syria. Since the beginning of the war in that country, an influx of people have taken refuge in Lebanon in order to avoid the hell of  war there. We  are trying to provide a decent life for those displaced people. However, their numbers are increasing and they are affecting local Lebanese communities, as reflected, in terms of security, in an increase in the crime rate of more than 30 per cent; in terms of the economy, in a rise in unemployment to 21 per cent; and in terms of demography, in an increase in the population density from 400 to 600 people per square kilometre. That is compounded by our limited resources and a paucity of international assistance for Lebanon, which makes it impossible for us to continue to shoulder this burden, especially now that most Syrian territory is safe.\nThat is why I called for a safe return when I addressed the Assembly from this very rostrum last year (see A/72/PV.11). At that time, I distinguished between a safe return and a voluntary return. Except for a few, the Syrians who have taken refuge in Lebanon are not political refugees; the majority came to Lebanon owing to the security situation in their country or for economic reasons.\nI have with me a map that was issued in 2014 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It shows an increase in the number of registered Syrian displaced persons from 25,000 in 2012 to more than 1 million in 2014 \u2014 just two years \u2014 and shows their distribution on Lebanese territory. The map illustrates what I am trying to explain to the Assembly. In that connection, I note that the United\nNations stopped counting displaced Syrians in 2014. The Lebanese General Security Directorate, however, has continued to keep track of those statistics, which show that the number of displaced Syrians in Lebanon increased to more than 1.5 million.\nI should therefore like to reaffirm my country\u2019s position in favour of strengthening the right to a dignified, safe and sustainable return of displaced Syrians to their country without delay. Their return should not  be connected to any political settlement,  as no one knows when that will be reached. We refuse and reject any nationalization project for the displaced persons or refugees. In that context, we welcome any initiative that seeks to resolve the displacement issue, such as the Russian initiative.\nHistory has taught us that injustice leads to war, and that the absence of justice and the application of double standards fuel resentment, which causes extremism, violence and terrorism. Unfortunately, the international political approaches to the Middle East region still lack justice and apply double standards. The Palestinian question is the best example of  that, as the absence   of justice in addressing it has led to many wars in the Middle East and inspired a resistance that will end only once injustice is eliminated and rights are realized.\nThe international community recently voted in the Security Council and the General Assembly against the declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Despite the results of the voting, which reflected the will of the international community, some embassies have been moved to Jerusalem. A law on the nature of Israel as a Jewish nation State was also adopted. That unjust law rejects other people and expressly undermines all peace efforts and the two-State solution.\nFurthermore, a decision was taken to withhold financial assistance to the United Nations Agency for the Relief and Work of the Refugees of Palestine in the Near East (UNRWA), which is mandated with assisting and protecting Palestinians pending a solution to their suffering. Has their suffering ended, thereby triggering an end to the role played by UNRWA? Is the objective to strip them of their status as refugees and to integrate them into their host countries in order to eliminate the Palestinian identity and force them to be naturalized?\nThe Palestinians are a people who found themselves without an identity or a country overnight, owing to a decision taken by those who were supposed to defend weak countries. Let us imagine for a moment that a\n \nsimilar international decision was taken that stripped us of our land and identity, and that while we were trying to hold on to them we were attacked from all sides in an effort to make us surrender. That is the situation today of the Palestinian people, who are dispersed throughout the world. Would we accept that situation for ourselves and our people? Would the international conscience accept that? Is that what is stipulated in international charters and conventions? What guarantees that small nations, such as the Lebanese people, will not face the same fate?\nFurthermore, Israeli violations of resolution 1701 (2006), which now exceed 100 a month, continue by land, sea and air, despite the fact that Lebanon remains fully committed to its implementation.\nOur world today is suffering a crisis of extremism and fanaticism that manifests itself in the rejection of others who are different and of their culture, religion, ethnicity and civilization \u2014 in essence, the rejection of their very existence. This crisis is likely to deteriorate. No country is safe from this crisis and its destructive effects on societies and States, because it will implode them from within.\nThe United Nations \u2014 and before it, the League of Nations \u2014 has been unable to prevent wars, maintain peace or achieve justice, especially in  our  region. One of the main reasons for that is  because there is  no international culture of peace based on mutual understanding and coexistence. There is therefore an urgent need for dialogue among religions,  cultures and races. We need international cultural institutions that specialize in spreading the culture of dialogue  and peace.\nLebanon is a pluralistic society in which Christians and Muslims live side by side and share governance and management. We also have a Lebanese diaspora spread throughout the world that shares common ground with many civilizations and cultures,  making  Lebanon  an exemplary country in which to establish a human academy for encounter and dialogue to disseminate those values. Last year, from this rostrum, I launched an initiative to turn Lebanon into an international centre for dialogue among religions, cultures and races. We hope that this initiative will materialize and become   a  multilateral convention to establish such a  centre  in Lebanon that would be an international project for ongoing dialogue and harmonious coexistence, in line\nwith the purposes of the United Nations, including preventive diplomacy to avoid conflicts.\nHumans are the enemy of whatever and whoever they do not know. Our salvation lies in dialogue and  in coming together, rejecting violence and achieving justice. That is the only path that can lead our societies to stability, security and sustainable development.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a distinct honour for me to address the General Assembly for the very first time as President of the Republic of Sierra Leone.\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Sierra Leone, I would like to express our heartfelt condolences to the Government and the people of the Republic of Ghana and to the United Nations family on the passing of Kofi Atta Annan, former Secretary- General of the United Nations. He served humankind and the world with distinction, and in our country\u2019s hour of need he helped to steer it out of a deep abyss of seemingly intractable war. May he rest in perfect peace. He always showed us what was possible and the best in humankind.\nOur commitment to building a peaceful and  more secure world, as enshrined in  the  Charter  of the United Nations, as well as our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the ongoing reform processes of the United Nations, perfectly resonates with the theme for this session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d.  The work of the United  Nations  should  continue to be guided by the values on which it was founded, including the promotion of peace, security, human\n \nrights, the equality of all nations, social progress and better living standards.\nIn April Sierra Leoneans registered their commitment to democratic governance with yet another peaceful transfer of power from a political incumbent to the opposition. We acknowledge with humility the many messages of commendation from  various  parts  of  the world for our conduct of peaceful and credible presidential, parliamentary and local council elections, which led to my election as President of the Republic of Sierra Leone.\nOn behalf of the people of Sierra Leone, let me  say that we sincerely appreciate the international community\u2019s invaluable contributions to facilitating and monitoring our electoral process. We acknowledge the role played by the United Nations and our development partners in  supporting  the  successful  conduct  of the elections. We are a successful model of a stable democracy, one that has evolved and matured over 20 years from the chaos and lawlessness of civil conflict.\nHowever, stable democracies must also be sustainable. Sierra Leoneans voted for a change of Government and for a new direction and the right direction. My Government  is  ready  to  maximize  our country\u2019s potential for development, because we believe that development sustains emerging, successful and stable democracies like ours. The international community has invested hugely in facilitating and stabilizing Sierra Leone\u2019s democracy, and it must continue to play its role in sustaining Sierra Leone\u2019s democracy, in collaboration with the Government and the people of Sierra Leone.\nIn addition to our firm commitment to good governance and the prudent and accountable management of our nation\u2019s resources, we are ready  to foster a congenial environment that is conducive to credible gross domestic product growth. We call on our bilateral partners to help us deliver on our people\u2019s expectations through the provision of development funds and technical assistance and the cultivation of valuable trade links. We cordially invite all credible investors to an open and  congenial  investment  environment, in which all their investments are guaranteed and protected by our relevant laws. We have worked assiduously to remove barriers to investment, and I ask all such investors to help us sustain our democracy.\nThe Assembly made a historic pledge during the 2005 World Summit to strengthen the United Nations\nwith a view to enhancing its authority and effectiveness, as well as its capacity to address effectively, and in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter, the full range of the challenges of our time.  A number of gains have been made, including the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council and the adoption of resolutions on the responsibility to protect. Those are laudable gains, but the need for reform is also urgent and imperative. We should now endeavour to demonstrate the political will to redress specifically the historical injustice done to the African continent.\nThe present geopolitical realities compel us to work to comprehensively reform the Security Council in order to ensure equitable representation in every organ of the United Nations. Africa is the only continent without representation in the permanent category of the Security Council, and is also underrepresented in the non-permanent category. Africa\u2019s demand for two permanent seats with all the rights and prerogatives   of current members, including the right of veto, and for two additional non-permanent seats, is  a  matter  of common justice and the right to have an equal say in decision-making on issues that affect the African region. It is time that we addressed without further delay the long-standing injustice and imbalance that is being perpetuated in the present configuration of the Security Council.\nAfrica is committed to the ongoing reforms that will make the United Nations fit for purpose in the twenty- first century. As the Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of  State  and  Government on the reform of the  United  Nations,  we  reiterate  our concern about this body\u2019s continued inaction on adopting measures that will enable Africa to take its rightful place in the Council. Unless and until we are able to contend with the reform of the Security Council, the most critical question of the day, the Organization will remain seemingly constituted on undemocratic and discriminatory principles.\nI want to emphasize the urgent importance of comprehensive reform of the Security Council by pointing out that 1.2 billion of the world\u2019s 7.5 billion people are African. Those 1.2 billion continue to contribute their fair share to maintaining world peace and security. About 70 per cent of the decisions taken in the Security Council ultimately affect those 1.2 billion Africans. Those 1.2 billion people, who are affected by more than 70 per cent of United Nations resolutions, are\n \ntherefore asking why they should be excluded from the Security Council, where they simply want their voices to be fully represented.\nMy Government\u2019s blueprint document for moving our country forward, entitled \u201cThe New Direction\u201d, focuses on taking Sierra Leone beyond the phase of peacebuilding and consolidation to firmly establishing a stable, peaceful, open and pluralistic  democracy that is a responsible and committed member of the international community of nations. At the domestic level, my Government has established priority areas, including job creation, access to quality education, youth empowerment, the empowerment of  women  and the disabled, combating graft and corruption and fostering a culture of accountability and transparency, ensuring effective and efficient public-service delivery and strengthening civic responsibility and national cohesion.\nGuided  by  both  our   specific   situation   and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our Government\u2019s initiative and policy actions involve strengthening our democratic institutions, opening up democratic spaces, promoting democratic dialogue and creating a more just and equal society. We see those as precursors to the sustainable growth of our economy and our development as a nation.\nAmong other things, my Government\u2019s economic and development policies,  as  I  stated earlier,  create a congenial environment for credible private-sector investment and entrepreneurship. We are eager to work with and listen to the private sector. Our policies are enabling, and our investment framework is attractive. We can ensure the full legal protection of all investments, and we can ensure predictable and profitable revenue streams and returns on investments.\nSierra Leone is starting to adopt renewable energy. We now need public and private investment  for commercial and industrial uses, such as powering hotels, agriculture and small-scale manufacturing. My country is endowed with sufficient renewable energy resources in solar irradiation, coastal and offshore wind and mini-hydro and bioenergy. My Government\u2019s target of 60 per cent renewable energy capacity by 2030 is practicable, especially in terms of generating growth in rural areas.\nSierra Leone, like most developing countries, has been on the expensive and dirty liquid-fuel treadmill since its independence. My Government is seeking\ninternational technical assistance and capacity-building for migrating a percentage of the country\u2019s power generation away from heavy liquid fuel to natural gas that is trucked to site. In that regard, my Government is seeking collaboration with local companies and engineering companies from around the world.\nWe believe that investment in renewable energy sources and liquefied natural gas will help  us  to  meet SDG 7 by modernizing our energy-generation systems, which will have a multiplier effect by helping our country to meet the SDGs for poverty alleviation through job creation and increased investments in health, water delivery and cities. We are determined  to make Sierra Leone the renewable energy hub of the Economic Community of West African States region. Our vision is positive for our world\u2019s climate, for foreign and local investors and development and for our country.\nMy Government has a bold vision for science, technology and innovation. In that regard, I have established the first directorate of science, technology and innovation. We have set an ambitious and achievable target for 2025 of developing solid information and communication technologies infrastructure that will support graft-free governance and the delivery of effective, reliable, responsive and transparent services, ranging from banking and business to education, agricultural extension, revenue collection, health-care delivery, access to justice, governance, tourism, trade and the rule of law.\nWe have undertaken extensive reforms, in line with the SDG 16+ Forum, to create a peaceful, just and inclusive Sierra Leone with resilient institutions. We are engaged in judiciary and criminal justice reform and, in collaboration with civil-society and partner organizations, we continue to build on gains in the delivery of justice that take into account disparities in access to justice.\nWe have launched a focused and sustained campaign against graft, waste and the misuse of public funds. Our revenue authority has streamlined revenue collection and reduced tax evasion and theft. We have launched a free quality education programme that provides access to basic and secondary education for girls and boys of school age.\nWe are building, retooling and opening up our governance, health-care, financial and other institutions so as to empower our women and young people, the\n \naged and our elderly and disabled compatriots. We are also reviewing discriminatory laws and practices, and will engage communities in order to change traditional structures that have excluded such persons. In particular, our young people, like their counterparts all over the world, are energized and eager to make Sierra Leone a better place. Our development policies and priorities harness their vibrancy and direct it towards targeted education and skills training, entrepreneurship and strong civic participation.\nWe are working on a comprehensive biometric identification system, so that all citizens can fully participate in the economic and civic life of our nation. In particular, we acknowledge the support of the United Nations Development Programme, Kiva and the United Nations Capital Development Fund in strengthening our national digital identification system. With their assistance we are modernizing our credit reference bureau, which will radically transform our financial inclusion landscape and the ease of doing business in our country.\nWe are fully committed to promoting a  free  press, rescinding adversarial public-order laws and protecting and promoting the right of citizens to know and access information. We have instituted a national civic-education commission to further ensure the unrestricted participation of every Sierra Leonean in our stable democracy. For all of these efforts, we need a constructive yet intensive and sustained engagement with our bilateral partners and partner institutions.\nMy Government is committed to increasing equitable access to quality health care for Sierra Leoneans. We call on our bilateral partner organizations and private investors to help us invest in and develop our critical institutional, technical and human-resource capacity, as well as the infrastructure needed to ensure the delivery of quality health care for Sierra Leoneans.\nWe recall with great appreciation the magnanimity of the world as we dealt with recent deadly epidemics such as the Ebola virus disease, and the sustained interventions of our partners in helping us to battle tropical diseases, including malaria, cholera and typhoid. We need more help in all those areas and in expanding and maintaining all immunization levels at 100 per cent. My Government has increased health-care investment, but that will not be enough. We call on the international community to enhance our institutional and technical capacity for preventive health care and for\nmanaging public health and environmental sanitation issues, including waste management and storm-drain water management in urban areas.\nSierra Leone welcomes the renewed commitment of the United Nations to conflict prevention, as embodied in its Charter. The world needs a stronger United Nations more than ever before, as well as consistent and effective multilateralism that collectively evaluates and cooperatively resolves humankind\u2019s common challenges, from trade to climate change and from world security to our common humanity and our collective social and economic well-being. Our foreign policy should be driven by the golden rules of impartiality and cooperation. That is the only way that humankind can respond effectively, without hesitation, to the global challenges that we all face today.\nWe acknowledge the continued relevance of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade  in  Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light  Weapons,  which  constitute the global framework for preventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. We welcome the Secretary- General\u2019s reform agenda on sustaining peace, including the efforts to reform peacekeeping, which is one of the most effective tools available to the United Nations for peace and security.\nMy Government will bolster Sierra Leone\u2019s participation in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, as a troop- and police-contributing country, and in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations, especially with the deployment of formed units or contingents of both military and police. Sierra Leone stands ready to continue contributing to world peace and security.\nWith a strong belief in a shared vision and a common destiny, Sierra Leone stands with the world in meeting global challenges. Sierra Leoneans also look to the world for the help it can offer in helping to consolidate Sierra Leone as an economically developed, open, inclusive and pluralistic democracy. As we often say, we are a country with a faith that wisdom inspires and one with a zeal that never tires. We are optimistic, because our country stands ready, on the threshold of a new direction.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to convey my delegation\u2019s congratulations to you, Madam President, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. Your election to preside over the Assembly represents the progress we are making towards gender equality, a momentum that we need to enhance at the global level. Yet the fact that you are only the fourth woman to do so shows how far we still have to go. I also wish to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his leadership in steering the Organization during these challenging times. The theme that you have chosen for the session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable, and sustainable societies\u201d, is most appropriate.\nNow more than ever before, we need the international community to work together to build resilient societies in order to ensure  that  everyone has a fair share of the benefits of development. In order to achieve that, we need the United Nations to assume greater leadership in unifying our collective efforts. The focus should be on building communities that can withstand shocks and bounce back stronger. Recognizing that, the cornerstone of the development strategy of the Maldives is to build resilience: economic resilience, institutional resilience, environmental resilience and, indeed, political resilience.\nThe Maldives is an old nation, but a young democracy. In our journey towards the consolidation of our democracy, 23 September of this year was an extraordinary day. On that day, the Maldives held its third multi-party presidential election. The election took place peacefully and seamlessly, with a voter turnout of 89 per cent. It was a moment that made every Maldivian proud of how far we have come and the accelerated progress that the country has achieved. Following the\nelection, the Maldives is now going through the process of the transfer of power from one elected Government to the other.\nThe accelerated pace of democratization in the Maldives is moving in tandem with an even faster growth in social and economic development. From its humble beginning as one of the poorest countries in the world at its independence in 1965  to its status today  as an upper middle-income country, the Maldives is a success story by any measure. The Maldives has one of the highest human development indicators in our region, with nearly universal literacy rates, universal immunization and the lowest infant mortality and maternal mortality rates. The country has eradicated diseases such as polio, measles, malaria and lymphatic filariasis, although various types of non-communicable diseases are emerging as new challenges.\nThe progress in the social sector can be sustained and expanded only through strong economic growth. The outgoing President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, in his five years in office, focused on developing and  modernizing  critical  infrastructure in order to stimulate growth in the country\u2019s main industries. The newly expanded runway at our main international airport and the ongoing expansion of the airport terminal will significantly boost the tourism industry and create jobs and increasing wealth. Just a few weeks ago we opened a bridge that connects our capital city, Mal\u00e9, with the main international airport and a reclaimed suburb of the capital, Hulhumal\u00e9. That has transformed the physical landscape of the capital by consolidating three separate populations, thus helping to achieve economies of scale and better adaptation to climate change.\nAt the same time, we cannot create islands of progress and  prosperity  without partnering   with our friends through the kind of partnerships that are mutually beneficial, based on mutual trust and  that are envisaged in various international agendas and agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Samoa Pathway and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The national developmental efforts of small islands developing States, such as the Maldives, need support in the form of capacity-building, transfer of technology, and access to finance in order to achieve the goals set out in international development agendas.\n \nThe United Nations can assume a greater level of leadership in fostering such support. In order to be able to do that, the Secretariat also needs the support of  the Assembly, so that it can assist countries in special situations, such as small island developing States, with a more balanced allocation of resources. The United Nations is the engine room of multilateralism, and the existence of small States, especially the small island developing States, depends on multilateral norms. And yet, the principles of international law that govern friendly relations and cooperation among States are being challenged at a fundamental level. There is, therefore, a need for countries, big and small, to return to the right side of the law.\nThe State of Palestine is one place where the occupying Power challenges international law and norms on a daily basis with a sense of impunity. Today, we once again join many other  countries in calling  for a permanent end to the unlawful occupation of Palestinian lands and for allowing the Palestinian people the possibility of exercising their legitimate right to self-determination. The Maldives firmly believes that lasting peace can be achieved only with  a two-State solution in which the State of Palestine achieves its sovereignty within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Unilateral measures that go against the grain of that internationally accepted arrangement are regressive and illegal.\nThe Maldives also calls for a peaceful end to the continuing war in Syria. The humanitarian situation continues to worsen. The Security Council has not adequately addressed that conflict and its consequences. We must take more assertive action to  stop  the  tide of suffering in Syria. Humanitarian intervention is a necessity. A permanent political solution is a must.\nSimilarly, the atrocities that are being committed against Muslims in Myanmar should not be ignored. The Maldives calls on the authorities in Myanmar to bring to justice the perpetrators who have committed genocidal crimes against the Rohingya Muslims. In particular, the recommendations of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar should be implemented without delay.\nArticle 1 of the Charter describes the United Nations as the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations. The United Nations can meaningfully fulfil that function only if it  is fit for  the purposes set out  in clear terms in the Charter. The reforms that the\nSecretary-General introduced in recent months to modernize the development system of the United Nations have begun to take shape. Yet our attempts to bring broader systemic reform to the Organization, such as the reform of the Security Council, have produced many processes but virtually no success, despite more than four decades of deliberations. The United Nations needs to be an institution where every Member State should feel welcomed, where the combined power of many ideas, many solutions and many voices can thrive in addressing the challenges of climate change, ocean degradation, poverty, exclusion and discrimination.\nFor small island developing States, such as the Maldives, the United Nations will always remain the indispensable partner in building our national resilience. We see the United Nations as the key in determining our place and our voice in global discourse. Ensuring the relevance of the United Nations must mean ensuring that everyone, from the biggest to the smallest, plays their part. It must mean offering everyone a place in finding shared solutions for our shared future. It must mean sharing the responsibility to deliver a more peaceful, a more just, equitable and sustainable future for our children and their children.\n"

Cambodia is an outstanding example of a war-torn country that has succeeded in completely transforming itself in a way that it is proud of.\nOnce infamous for its killing fields in a region made unstable by armed conflicts and dangerous landmines, Cambodia, formerly an economically backward country mired in poverty and food insecurity, now enjoys full peace. It has become a popular tourist destination in South-East Asia and a food exporter. It  also  stands out for its achievements in poverty reduction and its improvements across all social indicators. Cambodia is recognized as one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, having recently successfully graduated from low-income to lower-middle-income status, owing to its high economic growth, at around 7 per cent per annum over the past two decades.\nDespite being notorious for its history of armed struggle for power and multiple changes of Government, Cambodia is now governed by the rule of law and firmly respects multiparty liberal democracy, with regular, free and fair elections that enable its people to choose their country\u2019s leadership. In Cambodia\u2019s general election for electing members of the sixth National Assembly in July, nearly 7 million Cambodians, or 83.02 per cent of registered voters, cast their votes and freely expressed their political choices without coercion, threat or violence. Twenty registered political parties ran in the election, which clearly demonstrated the legitimacy of\n \nour pluralist politics and reflected what was described by thousands of domestic and international observers in Cambodia as a stable democratic process in the form of a free, fair and credible election.\nBy their votes, Cambodians reaffirmed their desire for peace, stability and long-lasting sustainable development. Indeed, neither the free choice of the Cambodian people nor the legitimate result of the election is a subject for question or debate. In some outside circles, however, where an ambition to interfere in the domestic affairs of Cambodia has been nourished, questions about the quality and integrity of our election process have been raised in statements that attack the outcome of the election. Such actions are a serious assault on the will of the Cambodian people.\nI would like to draw the attention of all States Members of the United Nations to the vitality of the Charter of the United Nations. We must all give the proper respect to that crucial document by avoiding interference in or damage or disruption to the sovereignty of independent States. We regretfully have to highlight the fact that the issue of human rights nowadays has become the way some powerful nations strive to impose civilization on other nations, or, according to their operating standards, as a pretext for interfering in the name of protecting political rights. As a result, the imposition of unilateral sanctions has become a popular weapon that powerful nations use to manage their international politics, which are completely driven by their geopolitical agendas.\nThat is nothing more than the use of brutal force by a particular State to impose its will on other sovereign States. In a world where the eras of imperialism and colonialism are now behind us, we have to acknowledge that not all nations in the General Assembly should follow the governing model of any particular country. Large countries should not attempt to impose their administrative systems on small countries because those small countries are sovereign and have legitimate aspirations to upholding their own identities. Today, when interdependence is key, the old-style coercive mindset needs to be put to rest. Together, both large and small countries must respect one another and uphold the rules of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe world is currently facing severe instability. Threats to peace are emerging in many forms, and more intensively than anything we have witnessed in\nthe past 25 years. We all live in a world of fragility, unpredictability and complicated changes, as challenges come from various fronts, with an increase in the number of persistent conflicts and unprecedented humanitarian crises.\nWe are deeply concerned about the tensions created in diplomatic circles by a first-world super-Power and the conflicts that are happening in many places thanks to its interference. We are also deeply concerned  about the hasty decisions made by that super-Power to withdraw from major international agreements. Such unilateral actions, which threaten the legitimacy of the international legal order, have undermined State-to- State relations and caused tension in the international community. Yet what exerts the most pressure is the direct attack on multilateralism.\nUndoubtedly, in our globalized world, all things are interconnected. If we begin to endorse protectionist policies, unilateralism and trade wars, we are closing the door on trade and investment opportunities, which, for many decades, have brought prosperity to all our countries, both small and large. Eventually, we will all become poorer, our economies will decline, financial capital will shrink, and our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and address the challenges caused by climate change will be seriously affected. Those factors will make poor countries suffer prolonged poverty, making us increasingly vulnerable to the dangerous ideology of terrorism and extremism and to regional conflicts.\nAs a small economy, Cambodia believes in the value of rules-based international cooperation. We have all prospered because of globalization. We are therefore convinced that global trade should not be hindered by the imposition of unilateral tariffs. Rather, it  should be enhanced and supported through the adherence to policies conducive to trade and investment, as well as through special preferential treatment for developing countries. Stability and diversification in the financial sector need to be further encouraged to promote innovation and development.\nAll in all, we must jointly maintain and strengthen multilateralism. In fact, peace  without  development is not sustainable. In that context, the Sustainable Development Goals play a pivotal role in guiding peoples towards prosperity. Cambodia views the SDGs as an important opportunity for mobilizing efforts aimed at reducing poverty, as well as sustainable and inclusive\n \ndevelopment. The Royal Government of Cambodia will soon approve the Cambodia Sustainable Development Goals, which have been fully adapted to the local level. We will use those goals to shape our medium- and long- term policies and plans for our country.\nMoreover, conflict prevention is a  precondition for long-lasting peace. United Nations peacekeeping forces play a  vital  leading  role  in  such  efforts.  As a result, Cambodia greatly welcomes the vision of Secretary-General  Ant\u00f3nio  Guterres  with   respect to peacebuilding and peacekeeping, particularly his ongoing attention to conflict prevention. Cambodia has been a consistent supporter of the United Nations peace and security architectures. For instance, for the past 12 years, Cambodia has sent thousands of Blue Helmet forces to join peacekeeping missions under the umbrella of the United Nations. However, peacekeeping today is facing unprecedented challenges, since non-State actors are waging wars of rebellion against our peacekeeping forces. Those wars have claimed many lives and caused much injury. We are strongly indebted to the sacrifices made by the United Nations peacekeeping heroes. Indeed, their sacrifice, including the ultimate example \u2014 death \u2014 has only increased our commitment to further contributing to the great cause of peace.\nAnother severe and complicated threat to long-lasting peace is terrorism. It has torn apart communities, worsened conflicts and  undermined the stability of whole regions. Currently, the battles against terrorism have become even more complex and sophisticated, since terrorists are turning to cyberspace to launch their malevolent operations. The cross-border nature of terrorism requires that we build multilateral cooperation with concerted coordination, including countermeasures and preventive measures.\nAddressing climate change is another key element for the success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which requires the urgent and focused attention of the global community. The fundamentals for action on climate change are undoubtedly contained in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In that spirit, Cambodia will provide full support to the Secretary- General in organizing the climate summit next year so as to foster the inspiration needed to further address climate change.\nLastly, I would like to emphasize that Cambodia fully supports the global leadership of the United\nNations and commits to implementing its shared responsibility to build a peaceful and equitable society that enjoys sustainable and inclusive development."

        "file_text": "Let me take this very early opportunity to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I have no doubt that the experience she draws from her distinguished career in the service of the Republic of Ecuador will be invaluable to her as she executes her new responsibility. I also note with appreciation that her strategic priorities for the seventy-third session, namely, strengthening multilateralism, catalysing the well-being of all persons and working to bring about a sustainable planet, as well as building a stronger, more efficient multilateral system, converge with Kenya\u2019s aspirations. It is therefore my pleasure to reaffirm my Government\u2019s complete commitment to our shared vision and to supporting the President during her tenure. The seventy-third session of the General Assembly is the second session to be held during the tenure of Secretary-General Guterres, who has already spoken publicly about the financial situation of the United Nations and has even spelled out reforms that need to be executed to ensure optimal utilization of our finances. I applaud the Secretary-General for his efforts and courage to cut costs and for his commitment to ensuring that the Organization\u2019s resources are better managed. Indeed, I am convinced that part of those objectives will be achieved with the adoption of the proposals made in the context of the adoption of the global service delivery model. In that regard, it is my hope that Kenya will have the privilege to host one of the proposed three service centres. I also applaud the commitment of the United Nations staff, who are engaged daily in tackling a myriad of challenges that are greater than any one country or region can resolve on its own.\nKenya strongly supports the General Assembly\u2019s embrace of better alignment in the mandates of urbanization, human settlement and environmental governance. Its approach will enable the United Nations Human Settlements Programme  (UN-Habitat)  and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to fully deliver on their role as global focal points for human settlements and environmental matters for the entire United Nations system.\nEven as we speak of important reforms at the United Nations, we must also recognize that the need for reforms is much broader and of greater significance than previously acknowledged. In almost every part of the world, a growing lack of trust is opening a dangerous gap between citizens and their governing institutions. That situation is partly the result of the impact of a number of significant factors, key among which is the growing demand by all our citizenry for accountability, occasioned by the attendant awareness of the gap between available resources and the provision of services to populations. Such demands are also fuelled by a growing awareness of the scourge of corruption and wastage of public resources and their negative effects on the lives and hopes of people.\nDue to the benefits of accessible information, never before in human history have so many people known how public trust is undermined by acts of commission or omission by a few individuals or networks, both in the private and public sectors. Weak systems of governance are manipulated and exploited for the gain of predatory interests at the expense of the common person. Free\n \nmedia and social media are rife with news of outright fraud, cynical conflicts of interest and financial arrangements that privatize gains during prosperous times and socialize losses during economic catastrophe.\nIn addition to individual corruption, major corporations misrepresent their earnings to deny Governments revenue needed for investment in the public good. The extraction of mineral and other resources continues to be subject to corrupt dealings that not only deny communities and countries any benefit but almost routinely lead to violence and instability. Such dealings have over several decades been clothed with the garments of legality, institutionalizing the exploitation by cartels and oligopolies that are pillaging Africa and other underdeveloped regions of their natural wealth. That is the source of the popular theorizing on Africa\u2019s resource curse.\nIt has become clearer to citizens all over the world that what is  enabling the illegal and illicit conduct    of corrupt individuals and companies is a globalized financial and legal system. Its impact is worldwide but it is probably the leading cause of most of the suffering on the African continent.\nThere is increasing evidence that Africa is a net exporter of much-needed capital to the world through illicit outflows. Conservative estimates indicate that between 1980 and 2009 illicit money outflows from Africa ranged from $1.2 trillion to $1.4 trillion, roughly equal to Africa\u2019s current gross domestic product and surpassing by far the money it received from outside over the same period. Every illicit dollar that leaves Africa goes somewhere \u2014 most often to where the rest of the money from tax evaders and criminals is hidden. Africans suffer as a result, but the irony is that what is done to Africa is eventually done to the rest of the world.\nThe present system of transferring and laundering illicit capital is enabling corrupt networks all over the world to illegally acquire in one country, while being welcomed with open arms as investors in  another. The same system is used by drug cartels and even terrorist networks. Collectively, drug addiction, violent extremism, international crime and terrorist actions result in misery and hurt to millions of victims all over the world.\nThe most tragic manifestation of the destructive impact of the misery as a result of the crimes mentioned heretofore is the loss of trust in governing institutions\nat the national, regional and global levels. As people observe the impunity, they increasingly feel that the economic systems are rigged against their hopes. Therefore, the trust deficit grows.\nFrequently, institutions of Government have become desirable vehicles to capture ethnic or racial interests articulated by populists and extremists who thrive in chronic instability and  drive  it  forward  with their incitement. When networks and cartels in Government capture the State for their own selfish gain and represent themselves as champions of an ethnic or religious group, the result is all too often civil strife and civil war. In such an atmosphere, the result of a political competition can begin to seem like an existential threat to groups and their members.\nThe fragility of our world is also manifest in instability and conflicts, as in the case of both Somalia and South Sudan. In Somalia, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is a unique regional effort that has deeply degraded one of Al-Qaida\u2019s most ambitious affiliates. Kenya has been part of that journey from the start. It was in Nairobi where a transitional federal State was negotiated into existence, with the material and moral support of the Kenyan people. We have never wavered. Kenyans have lost lives and property in pursuit of peace and stability in Somalia, and we appreciate our regional and international colleagues and partners. In Somalia, a historic chapter on Africa\u2019s will to peace and security is being written. We appreciate the partners standing with the region.\nBut the job is not yet done. We must ensure military success over Al-Shabaab if other  political and economic solutions are to take firm root. So far, the troop-contributing countries continue to bear a disproportionate burden. We have consistently sought the kind of international support that is commensurate with the threat scenario, including in the form of enablers and force multipliers. These have not been forthcoming. What the international community is doing with regard to Somalia is not good enough. We understand that these are difficult times economically, but global terrorism must be faced boldly. If we have learned any real lessons in the past 20 years, we should appreciate that AMISOM needs support, and it is up to all of us to make that happen.\nIn building peace there are no silver bullets. The process of bringing stability and peace to South Sudan requires commitment. It requires us to walk closely\n \nwith the South Sudanese parties, particularly now after the signing of the revitalized peace agreement. Kenya is proud of having walked with the Sudan and South Sudan in their pursuit of peace and stability. We have always known and firmly believe that the constancy of our efforts would yield the fruit of a prosperous and free South Sudan.\nToday, we  call on  all Member States to join  us in that endeavour for peace and stability in South Sudan. I appeal to all Members, development partners, international agencies and  friends  of  South  Sudan to redouble their efforts and support  this  cause  to end the suffering of the children, women and men of South Sudan.\nAllow me to turn to the global sphere, which has also not been spared the challenges of today. Multilateralism is under severe strain, as evidenced by our global trading and economic management system. Rarely has the system of trade and security that was established following the Second World War, under the auspices  of the United Nations, been under greater strain. The populism and extremism unleashed at the national level has brought forward powerful constituencies that want a dismantling of the global order.\nI believe that the most urgent political task in the world today is to close the trust gap between people and governing institutions. Governments are not owed trust by citizens; that trust must be won and protected. It is not an exaggeration to say that the future of global stability and the continuity of many States turn on this issue.\nThere are bold solutions that  we  must  embrace in order to succeed. We have to fight impunity, seriously and without fear or favour. In Kenya, we are undertaking an aggressive campaign against fraud  and abuse of public trust. We  have  reached  out  to our partners in Switzerland and the United Kingdom to take action against transfers of illegal proceeds of corruption to their banking and  financial  systems. We will pursue more such bilateral arrangements. They must be accompanied by determined reforms that are subject to clear timelines and standards, and which combat systemic corruption in the multilateral system, money-laundering and the offshoring of illicit outflows. The single overarching aim must be to make it exceedingly difficult to transfer and launder illegally acquired wealth in any part of the world.\nIndeed, all United Nations bodies should be given the task of detecting corruption in their different  focus areas and promoting the skills and systems to combat it, in the understanding that honest, transparent and responsive Government is fundamental to the achievement of their aims. We must create a stronger understanding of the presence and impact of such deals in their different focus areas.\nThe gap in trust that we are talking about at the national level can also be found at the global level and is aimed squarely at the leadership and processes of the multilateral system, as reflected in the Security Council, the Bretton Woods institutions and other parts of the system. In the years following the Second World War, the present status quo was functional and understandable. That is no longer the case 75 years later. The global governance system must also undergo reform if it is to be relevant and effective.\nThe clearest sign that change is real will be in reforms to the membership of the Security Council. Kenya joins the demand for two permanent seats for Africa \u2014 with the rights and prerogatives of current members, including the right of veto, as well as additional non-permanent seats. As we all know, Africa is underrepresented in the non-permanent category of the Security Council, and we are not represented at all in the permanent category. That historical injustice is a clear indication of the skewed system that has perpetuated an exclusive model of governance that fuels the trust gap between nations. The governance, leadership and employment in United Nations funds, programmes and agencies must also become more noticeably inclusive of the global South, especially Africa.\nKenya is a proud host to the only United Nations global headquarters in the global South, namely, the headquarters of both UNEP and UN-Habitat, whose mandates and effectiveness we are strongly committed to supporting. We strongly believe that the multilateralism that would headquarter major organizations in Africa and the global South is what the world needs. Global decision-making needs more of Africa if the world is to respond wisely to the demographic and economic shifts that are under way.\nWithout Governments and the international system addressing the broadening deficits in fairness and inclusiveness, corruption, populism, radicalization, civil strife  and  political  instability  will   continue to destabilize and destroy. Today\u2019s problems, risks\n \nand threats are complex and call  for  more  \u2014  not  less \u2014 cooperation, more \u2014not less \u2014 observance of the rule of law, more \u2014 not less \u2014 negotiation. We need a rules-based multilateral system. We are at a decisive moment, and Kenya will play its part to be a champion for change. I welcome all delegations in a campaign for our collective benefit.\nIn conclusion, the sea is increasingly being seen  as a sustainable source of food, jobs and prosperity for the growing populations of the world. It is with that in mind that Kenya and Canada will co-host the first-ever global conference on the sustainable blue economy from 26 to 28 November this year, in Nairobi. I therefore take this opportunity to welcome all delegations to this conference and its deliberations on how we can access and harness financing, technology and skills as well as innovations and capacity-building to allow us to turn the blue economy into a driver of millions of jobs, a source of food and sustainable shared prosperity. We will be greatly honoured to host you,  Mr.  President, in Nairobi.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to express my deepest condolences on the passing away of Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations. The world will forever remember his name, which has been etched in the road to peace.\nI would like to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I hope the United Nations will be able to reach out to every corner of the globe through this session. I also hope that the United Nations  will  make  further progress in contributing to  the international  community under the excellent leadership of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\nAs I did last year (see A/72/PV.11), I stand here once again with a sense of urgency and excitement. Something miraculous has taken place on the Korean peninsula over the past year. For the first time in history, the leader of North Korea crossed the Military Demarcation Line to visit Panmunjeom. A historic summit between the United States and North Korea was held on the island of Sentosa in Singapore. Chairman Kim Jong Un and\n \nI removed the shadow of war and resolved to usher in an era of peace and prosperity. At the United States- North Korea summit, the two sides agreed to work towards achieving the complete denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, thereby ending hostile relations and establishing a permanent peace regime. President Trump and Chairman Kim took action and gave hope to those who desire peace an around the world. North Korea dismantled its nuclear test site in Punggye-ri, under the observation of the international community. The United States and the Republic of Korea suspended large-scale joint military exercises and built trust. I would like to thank and salute President Trump and Chairman Kim\u2019s courage and resolve as they usher in a new era on the Korean peninsula, as well as in United States-North Korea relations.\nLast week in Pyongyang, I met Chairman Kim for the third time and reached an agreement once again to turn the Korean peninsula into a land of peace, free from nuclear weapons and threats. Chairman Kim expressed his hope of completing denuclearization as soon as possible to focus on economic development. Moreover, Chairman Kim expressed his commitment to permanently dismantling the missile-engine test site and launch platform in Dongchang-ri, under the observation of the international community as a first step in order to expedite progress in denuclearization. Furthermore, he expressed his firm willingness to continue to take additional denuclearization measures, including the permanent dismantlement of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, as the United States takes corresponding measures in the spirit of the Sentosa agreement.\nThe Korean peninsula has remained under the Armistice for the past 65 years. Ending the Korean War is an urgent task. It is a process we must go through in order to move towards a peace regime. I look forward to seeing bold measures for denuclearization implemented among the countries concerned, thereby leading to a declaration to end the war. Regardless of the challenges that lie ahead, the leaders of the south, the north and the United States will move step by step towards peace based on mutual trust. Such a dramatic change has been possible thanks to the support and encouragement of people around the world who desire peace. The United Nations in particular gave North Korea the courage to embark upon the road to peace. I would like to express my gratitude to the United Nations for its role. However, that is just the beginning. I would like to ask for continued support and cooperation from the Member\nStates on our journey towards complete denuclearization and permanent peace. The Republic of Korea will spare no effort to encourage North Korea\u2019s participation in the international community, while adhering to the resolutions adopted by the United Nations.\nA prelude to peace on the Korean peninsula unfolded in Pyeongcheng, Gangwon province last winter. It  was the moment when the Olympic Truce resolution adopted at the General Assembly in November 2017 came to precious fruition. Secretary-General Guterres and many Heads of State extended their congratulations on the participation of North Korean athletes and officials in the Pyeongcheng Olympic Winter Games. They expressed their wishes for unity and peace on the Korean peninsula. The world was awakened to the sense of a new history of peace being written. I would like  to take this opportunity to thank the President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, for his leadership and contribution in opening the way for North Korea to participate in the Pyeongcheng Olympic Winter Games. Just over a month after the close of the Pyeongcheng Paralympic Winter Games, Chairman Kim and I met for the first time in Panmunjeom. The United Nations welcomed and actively supported the adoption of the Panmunjeom Declaration. By doing so, it provided tremendous strength to the meetings that have followed, including the second inter-Korean summit, the United States-North Korea summit and the recent inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang.\nAt the seventy-second session of the General Assembly, I expressed the hope that North Korea would choose peace of its own accord in order to establish sound and sustainable peace. That hope was shared   by the United Nations and the entire international community. North Korea responded positively to our hopes and calls. Chairman Kim changed the direction of the political situation on the Korean peninsula through his New Year\u2019s address on the first day of this year. The participation of North Korea\u2019s athletes and delegation in the Pyeongcheng Winter Olympics provided the decisive momentum to break the impasse in building peace. On 20 April, North Korea officially ended its policy of nuclear development and has since devoted all of its efforts to economic development. On 9 September, during the ceremony marking the seventieth anniversary of its founding, North Korea expressed its commitment to peace and prosperity instead of boasting about its nuclear capabilities. North Korea moved out of long- standing isolation on its own initiative and stands before\n \nthe international community once again. Now it is the international community\u2019s turn to respond positively to North Korea\u2019s new choices and efforts. We must assure Chairman Kim that he has made the right decision in committing to denuclearization. We must encourage North Korea to stay on the path that leads to permanent and solid peace.\nThe role of the United Nations is crucial. The Secretariat has continued its efforts for dialogue and engagement, including the invitation of North Korean officials to international conferences. The United Nations has announced its commitment to leave no one behind. My sincere hope is that the vision of the United Nations of sustainable development will be  realized on the Korean peninsula. I have no doubt that, if the international community paves the way, North Korea will not stall in making strides towards peace and prosperity. The Republic of Korea will spare no effort in guiding North Korea towards that path. I would like to call on the United Nations to share its experience and wisdom.\nThe process of working towards denuclearization and establishing peace on the Korean  peninsula  is one that also leads to building peace and cooperation in North-East Asia, which is home to one fifth of the world\u2019s population and accounts for a quarter of the global economy. However, regional conflicts stand in the way of pursuing broader cooperation. We will begin the work of resolving conflicts in North-East Asia starting with the Korean peninsula.\nOn 15 August, I proposed the creation of an East Asian railroad community, which would involve six North-East Asian countries and the United States.  The European Coal and Steel Community, which gave birth to the creation of the European Union, is a living example of what that kind of  initiative could achieve. I believe that the East Asian railroad community will be able  to serve as a  starting point for  the creation   of an energy and economic community in East Asia, and, going a step further, lead to a multilateral peace and security architecture in North-East Asia. The two Koreas are working to reconnect disconnected railroads and roads. Going forward, the Republic of Korea will engage in close consultations with countries in the region on concrete steps towards the East Asian railroad community. As we work to realize the United Nations spirit of multilateralism and pave the way for a future of shared prosperity, I would like to ask for the support and cooperation of the international community.\nThe Republic of Korea, together with the United Nations, has weathered the storms of modern history. The United Nations and the Republic of Korea share common values and philosophies. This month, the Government of the Republic of Korea announced its vision of an inclusive nation based on a people-centred governing philosophy. We  are  moving  towards  a  fair and just nation, as well as a society in which no one is discriminated against and everyone lives in harmony. Inclusiveness is also a philosophy embedded in international development cooperation. The Government of the Republic of Korea will steadily expand its contribution to development cooperation to create a global community that leaves no one behind.\nThe Republic of Korea is also increasing its assistance to people who are suffering from human rights violations and discrimination, in particular the most vulnerable groups, including children, youth, women and those with disabilities. We have increased our financial aid for refugees five times in the past five years. Starting from this year, Korea is providing 50,000 tons of rice every year to developing countries that are suffering from severe food crises. I believe that there needs to be a holistic approach that encompasses peace, development and human rights so as to fundamentally resolve humanitarian crises. The Government of the Republic of Korea will engage in discussions and provide support to make the United Nations relevant to all people.\nThis year marks the seventieth  anniversary  of  the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Anyone who has confronted the abuse of power to advance human rights carries in his or her heart the first clause of the Declaration \u2014 \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal\u201d. In particular, I am working to realize gender equality in tangible ways, as an important part of our administrative agenda. All forms of discrimination and violence against women are being dealt with even more sternly. Korea has suffered directly from the Japanese military\u2019s mobilization of comfort women. We will actively participate in discussions within the international community with regard to the issue of women and peace and security. We will also work together with the international community in efforts to eradicate sexual violence in conflict.\nResponding to climate change and transitioning to a low-carbon economy are challenges and tasks facing our generation. The Government of the Republic of Korea will raise its share of renewable energy in the\n \nnation\u2019s total power generation to 20 per cent by 2030. We will faithfully implement the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, in compliance with the Paris Agreement, and assist developing countries in their pursuit of sustainable development by supporting them with climate-change responses.\nFor the two Koreas, the significance of the United Nations goes beyond any international organization. On 17 September 1991, at the forty-sixth session  of  the General Assembly, the then 159  States Members of the United Nations unanimously adopted resolution 46/1 for the joint accession by South Korea and North Korea to the United Nations. Coincidentally, that day was the International Day of Peace. In their respective speeches, the representatives of South Korea and North Korea pledged that, although South Korea and North Korea had started as separate members, they would eventually become one some day through reconciliation, cooperation and peace (see A/46/PV.1). Now, 27 years later, South Korea and North Korea are realizing the pledge made on that day. We have crossed the barriers of division and are tearing down the walls in our hearts. We are proving to the international community that, when we come together, we have sufficient means to establish peace.\nWe all desire peace. Peace represents the relatives and neighbours we love and the home towns we long for. Peace means sharing what we have together. A peace we have all achieved together is a peace for all. I am confident that all members will be with us always on the path to permanent peace and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, as well as on the journey to a peaceful world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a bright and sunny Saturday morning outside. I  thank  members for sacrificing their time to participate in this debate.  I add my voice to those who congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s of Ecuador on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. I also thank my friend Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs of Slovakia, for his sterling leadership of the seventy-second session.\nThe one word that we have probably heard the most over this past week is \u201cmultilateralism\u201d. Multilateralism is at a crossroads. In fact, it is facing a significant threat. In recent years, we have witnessed a crisis of confidence in the concept of multilateralism and its institutions. Whether in trade, security or dispute resolution, questions have arisen about whether the multilateral system can continue to deliver effective solutions for the multitude  of  problems  that  we face. I stand here as a representative of a tiny, open and trade-dependent city State, and Singapore has witnessed this recent retreat from multilateralism with grave concern. That is why today I want to raise my voice in defence of multilateralism. There is perhaps no better forum for me to do so than the United Nations, the ultimate bastion of multilateralism.\nIt  is  actually  easy  to  understand  why  there  is a resurgence in isolationist, protectionist and even xenophobic sentiments in the political arena all over the world. We are living in uncertain, volatile and disruptive times. The digital revolution is increasingly disrupting the way we live, work, play, communicate, organize and mobilize our societies. Non-State actors and transboundary threats, terrorism, pandemics and climate change remain a clear and present danger. Frontier issues such as artificial intelligence and cybercrime have leapt from the pages of science fiction into our daily lives. Our social cohesion is breaking down, and all too often we operate in isolated social and political bubbles.\nAt the same time, the international order as we know\nit  is being disrupted. Since 1945,  many countries and\nregions have benefited from the open global system \u2014 a world order that was substantially underwritten by a single Power: the United States of America. But today we are transitioning to a multipolar world, where other Powers are quite rightly beginning to assume a greater role in multiple spheres. That is a transition that has to be managed carefully and delicately.\nI am not saying  that  multilateralism  is  perfect. In fact, we recognize that it has not always fulfilled  all its promises. And, quite  frankly,  sometimes  it has been oversold as a panacea. How then do  we  make multilateralism work in this rapidly shifting geostrategic context? My take is that every State has to make room to accommodate the new realities and find a new modus vivendi. Foreign policy and trade policy actually always begin at home. Politics is always local. We need to achieve a rebalancing in our domestic societies and political spheres, as well as in the global, international sphere. The global order will need to evolve. Our responsibilities will need to be rebalanced. In this perilous period of transition, we cannot and should not abandon the rules-based world order that has brought about unprecedented peace and prosperity for 70 years.\nIn fact, the scale and transboundary nature of the challenges that we face today demand more cohesion and cooperation, not less. There is a strong case to be made for doubling down on multilateralism, rather than retreating from it. We need a clear framework of rules and norms so as to ensure predictability and stability in inter-State relations and commerce. Defining those rules through a multilateral process in which all States engage with one another as equals is necessary in order to build consensus and to strengthen respect for the rule of law.\nCompliance with the agreed rules by all States is not only essential for global stability and for governing the global commons, it is especially crucial for a small city-State like Singapore. The principle that agreements should be respected and implemented is fundamental for our survival. Without the rule of international law the strong do what they will, and the weak will suffer what we must.\nFor small States like Singapore, we cannot survive in such a world. That is why Singapore has always been a staunch defender of the United Nations, international law and the multilateral system. Let us  take trade,  for example. Globalization has actually not benefited\n \neveryone equally. There remain pockets of poverty and hunger in our world. Our people are worried about jobs. Unfortunately, the conventional arguments in favour of free trade, economic integration, and cooperation between countries have gone out of fashion.\nToday, trade frictions between the United States and China have raised the spectre of a trade war. But we cannot simply blame globalization. All Governments of today have an obligation to consider long-term and sustainable solutions, instead of just raising trade barriers. For example, in order to truly address widening inequality and wage stagnation we must address the root causes. In the midst of the digital revolution, we must ensure that our people have the right skills for new emerging jobs. It is futile to fight to protect obsolete technologies and to squabble over yesterday\u2019s jobs. On the contrary, we must try to take advantage of the new opportunities of the global market to create the jobs of the future.\nIt is therefore our responsibility, as Governments, to actively put in place policies to train, retrain, retool and reskill our citizens by investing in infrastructure, training and education. That is why we in Singapore are working so hard to restructure our education system. We are putting in serious money to enable our people to continuously upgrade and learn new skills through a programme we  call SkillsFuture. The emphasis is  on the word \u201cfuture\u201d. Right now, in Singapore our focus is on restructuring our economy,  identifying and working with the private sector to transform jobs, enhance our competitiveness and elevate productivity across the board. That is fundamentally an investment in our people to make sure that all of us are ready for the future.\nUltimately, no country benefits from trade conflicts and protectionism. The negative impacts will ripple through the global supply chain and will undermine growth and prosperity in all countries. We will all be worse off. At this time of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence we need a multilateral approach and strong rules, now more than ever. Singapore will continue to be a strong and staunch supporter of the rules-based multilateral trading system. The critical importance of the World Trade  Organization cannot be overemphasized: it is the ultimate neutral arbiter of international trade disputes.\nAnother area where  we  urgently  need to promote\nthe adoption and implementation of rules and norms is\nin cyberspace. To reap the full benefits of the digital revolution, we must develop a trusted, open and inclusive cyberspace underpinned by international law and well-defined norms of responsible State behaviour. The International Telecommunication Union has ranked Singapore as  the  country  most  committed  to cybersecurity in 2017. Yet, in July this year, we discovered that one of Singapore\u2019s major health databases had been subjected to an advanced persistent threat. That was a deliberate, targeted and sophisticated cyberattack. No country is immune to such attacks. But all of us need to work together to prevent them. We need to implement norms and rules that will prohibit such attacks on critical infrastructure, particularly where lives are at stake.\nStates have always turned to the United Nations as the only universal, inclusive, multilateral forum that can develop the rules that govern the global commons. One example is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides the global legal framework for all activities in the oceans and seas, which we depend on for trade, food and resources. Just as Singapore strongly supported the UNCLOS process in the past, Singapore stands ready now to contribute to the United Nations work aimed at developing and adopting norms and rules on cybersecurity. That is simply another example of the global commons, and we cannot allow the tragedy of the commons to occur in cyberspace, in the sea or in the area of climate change.\nTo that end, we support the reconvening of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security and the continuation of its work in developing the norms for States\u2019 behaviour in cyberspace. Cybersecurity has been a priority  under Singapore\u2019s chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the third ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity, which was held in Singapore just last week, all 10 ASEAN member States agreed to subscribe in principle to the 11 norms contained in the 2015 report of the GGE (A/70/174).\nSingapore is also committed to capacity-building, which we feel  is  essential for  States in their efforts  to effectively implement rules and norms of State behaviour. Singapore will launch an ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence in 2019. We have also partnered with the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs on a United Nations-Singapore\n \nCyber Programme, which will raise awareness and build capacity in our region.\nOur work in ASEAN  is  rooted  in  our  belief  that regional organizations can demonstrate how multilateralism continues to be relevant and beneficial for people all over the world. As the Chair of ASEAN this year, Singapore will continue to work with all our member States and our external partners to ensure that the regional architecture remains open, inclusive and rules-based. We are working  with  our  partners to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. When that is concluded, the Partnership will be the world\u2019s largest  trading bloc,  accounting for up to a third of the world\u2019s GDP.  But our interest  is not just in big  trade figures. We  also want to send  a powerful message that  ASEAN  member  States  and our six partners \u2014 India, China, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand \u2014 stand for and are committed to free trade, regional integration and international cooperation.\nASEAN Member States are also working together to leverage the digital revolution for our peoples\u2019 benefit. We established the ASEAN Smart Cities Network at the thirty-second ASEAN Summit in April. The Smart Cities Network focuses on ensuring interoperability and the integration of services, and allows cities in our region to share experiences and exchange solutions and lessons learned. We have just concluded an ASEAN agreement on streamlining e-commerce within South- East Asia so that our businesses can market and sell their products easily, conveniently and seamlessly across South-East Asia.\nASEAN member States are also committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes, and to doing so through a multilateral process. In that connection let me now address my friends in Myanmar, and particularly the situation in Rakhine state, which is a matter of grave concern for the region and beyond. The crisis is a complex and deep-rooted intercommunal conflict, the roots of which go back centuries. More recently, we have read harrowing accounts of brutal and shocking atrocities. We have to condemn all human rights violations, threats, loss of life and the violence inflicted on defenceless people.\nWe expect the Independent Commission of Inquiry established by the Government of Myanmar to carry out impartial investigations expeditiously and to hold those responsible fully accountable. We also hope that\nthe voluntary return of refugees to Myanmar in a safe, secure and dignified manner will commence soon without undue delay.\nHowever, ultimately,  a  political  solution  needs to be found \u2014 a solution and process that involves reconciliation, fairness, justice and better prospects for all communities. Only then can we achieve a durable solution to that complex, long-standing problem. All members of ASEAN stand ready to support and assist Myanmar in that very challenging and difficult situation.\nWe have also been  watching  the  developments on the Korean peninsula, which is not far from our region. This year, Singapore was able to make a small contribution towards easing tensions by hosting the summit between the United States and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea leaders in June. That summit, as well as the three inter-Korean dialogues that have been held this year, are important steps towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Singapore hopes that dialogue and the associated efforts and the reservoir of trust that has been built up will bring peace ultimately to that troubled part of Asia.\nLet me conclude by saying that there is no doubt that multilateralism needs to be defended and that the United Nations itself needs to be strengthened. That  is the only way we can deal with the complex global challenges of the future. As States Members of the United Nations, each of us has a responsibility to work together and to improve and adapt the multilateral systems that we have built painstakingly over the past seven decades. We need to find solutions and build consensus, so that our people can lead better, more secure and more peaceful lives. Ultimately, a rules- based multilateral system is absolutely indispensable to our efforts to secure peace and prosperity for our people at home on this one planet that we call Earth.\n"

        "file_text": "This year we celebrate the centenary of the end of the First World War. The League of Nations was supposed to safeguard peace, but it failed. The United Nations rose from the ashes of  the Second World  War  to address  a world that had been destroyed by fascism, Nazism, racism and colonialism. By adopting the Charter of  the United Nations, a brave generation of leaders gave\n \nhope to the unprivileged, the oppressed and the denied that they would be able to exercise their right to self- determination.\nSeventy years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights represented another glimmer of hope for humankind, and thanks to the work of the United Nations and its numerous programmes, that hope became realistic. Through peacekeeping missions, arms control, non-proliferation treaties and the fight against terrorism and international organized crime, we built a safer world. The Sustainable Development Goals have helped us to focus our energy on reducing poverty, eradicating illness, enabling access to education, clean water and sanitation and creating opportunities for young people. With the Paris Agreement on Climate Change we are fighting climate change and trying to build communities and nations that are resilient where threats of disaster are concerned. As a result, millions of  people today are living better lives than they did    a decade ago. All of those achievements would be unimaginable had we not united our efforts through the United Nations.\nAs President of the Republic of Macedonia, I can rightly say that the Macedonian people participated in the creation of the post-Second World War order. We were on the right side of history, because, even back  in 1941, we had started to fight the evils of fascism and Nazism.  The  Macedonian   State   participated in the creation of the United Nations. In 1945, the Federal People\u2019s Republic of Yugoslavia was one of the founders of the Organization. As a constitutive Republic with a right to self-determination and secession, Macedonia was therefore a de facto founder of the United Nations. As a State within the Federal People\u2019s Republic of Yugoslavia, we participated in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international pacts on civil and political, economic, social and cultural rights that guarantee human dignity, the right to self-determination as well as the right of States to sovereign equality. On 8 September 1991, exercising our sovereign right to self-determination and secession, we peacefully left the collapsing Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and proclaimed an independent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia.\nIn all of that, a great injustice has been done, and this is what it is all about. To date, we have not been allowed to fully enjoy the privileges of  membership  in the Organization or of the documents in whose creation we once participated. We have been denied the\nsovereign right to call ourselves by our name, as if a mere administrative region in Greece of the same name could have greater rights in international relations than a sovereign State such as the Republic of Macedonia.\nTwenty-five years ago, on 8 April 1993, the Republic of Macedonia became a State  Member  of the United Nations. And yet in this community of equals before the law, the Republic of Macedonia was admitted as less equal, with a derogated legal status and a violated right to self-determination. Today, 25 years later, the talks within the United Nations on this matter may end with the adoption of the so-called Prespa final agreement, which, according to some, should put an end to the name dispute with Greece and open the way to membership for the Republic of Macedonia in the European Union (EU) and NATO. The settlement begins with a grand preamble that would make even the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights envious. Ironically, the Prespa agreement violates the same universal principles and standards that it refers to in its preamble, including the right to human dignity.\nWith regard to the rights that have been violated, I want to draw the General Assembly\u2019s attention to one, the right to self-determination. Its meaning is that only a nation itself has the right to determine its destiny, and that no one has the right to forcibly interfere in the life of the nation, destroy its schools and other institutions, violate its traditions and customs, repress its language or curtail its rights. The right to self-determination means that a nation may organize its life in the way it wishes, specifically on the basis of autonomy. It has the right to complete secession. Nations are sovereign and all nations have equal rights.\nThe right to self-determination is what empowers a people to choose their own name and the name of the State that they create. The right to choose a name is  an inalienable part of the right to self-determination. Only by respecting the right  to  self-determination can the United Nations be relevant for  all people. As  a people, we have borne the name \u201cMacedonians\u201d for centuries and, as a State for 74 years, before the United Nations even existed. Our attachment to that name was confirmed 27 years ago, when we exercised our right to self-determination and proclaimed an independent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia.\nStill, through the Prespa agreement, Greece is imposing a new name on us and is asking for an erga omnes implementation for both international and\n \ndomestic use. It assumes that we will change our Constitution, meaning  that  Greece  would  become an ultimate authority whose approval is required for other States\u2019 constitutional amendments. Through this settlement Greece would be permitted to permanently monitor not only what we call ourselves but also how all States Members of the United Nations address us. It would be authorized to rename our institutions, censor the content of our children\u2019s schoolbooks and prevent citizens from expressing their Macedonian identity, including by regulating what we call our Macedonian language. A very important part of our way of life would therefore depend on Greek will. That would represent censorship of the world and require the Macedonian people to censor themselves. It does violence to our collective historical memory.\nThere are hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and testimonies in the United Nations archives detailing what  the  Greek State used to  do  to Macedonians in Greece. Now, through the Prespa agreement, the Greek State is trying to do the exact same things to Macedonians in the Republic of Macedonia. Its aim is to limit the use of the name \u201cMacedonians\u201d to the smallest possible space, that is, the space between our ears, while requiring us to keep our mouths shut. It is a flagrant violation of the right to self-determination.\nThe Prespa agreement is the bitter fruit of a tree that was poisoned long ago. It is a reflection of a hurtful compromise flowing from the 1995 Interim Accord. At a time when we were internationally isolated, the Interim Accord, achieved under the auspices of the United Nations, was supposed to guarantee that Greece would not block our integration into international organizations.  However,  it  was  seriously flawed. No one can transfer more rights to another than they actually possess. And yet under article 5 of the 1995 Interim Accord and the United Nations-led process, Greece was allowed to negotiate with the Republic of Macedonia on its name, in a violation of the right to self-determination.\nThe Interim Accord itself was not created out of thin air, as it originated in Security Council resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993). Although the Security Council noted that the Republic of Macedonia fulfilled the criteria for United Nations membership set out in Article 4 of the Charter, it nevertheless concluded that there was a dispute over the name of the State, making the Republic of Macedonia\u2019s membership subject to the condition of accepting the provisional name of \u201cthe\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d and imposing the obligation to discuss the naming issue. That formulation is nothing but a euphemism for violating the right to self-determination, which is how we arrived at the root of the problem.\nThe right to self-determination  was  violated when the Republic of Macedonia was admitted to the United Nations. The Interim Accord and the Prespa agreement were adopted to justify that violation. The Assembly should know that the text of the so-called Prespa agreement was prepared without my knowledge or consent as President of the Republic of Macedonia. Moreover, the agreement violates a clause in our domestic law that is of fundamental importance. In other words, the knot that began to form with resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993) and the Interim Accord has now, with the Prespa agreement, taken the shape of a hangman\u2019s noose. The Republic of Macedonia is now being asked to commit legal and historical suicide so that the legal abolition of the Macedonian people can then be interpreted as the country\u2019s own wilful decision. What does that say about global leadership and shared responsibility in the context of the United Nations?\nGreece insists on an erga omnes implementation of the imposed name, which also makes the violation of the right to self-determination erga omnes. However, the International Court of Justice stated in its judgment in East Timor (Portugal v. Australia) of 30 June 1995 that the right to self-determination does indeed have an erga omnes effect. However, that very important decision was overlooked in the preparation of the Interim Accord three months later.\nIt has been said that the Macedonian case is unique in the United Nations. However, the United Nations archives contain an almost identical case in which a Member State argues for denying an applicant country\u2019s right to membership because of its name. I say \u201calmost identical\u201d because the United Nations ignored the Member State\u2019s request to block the other country\u2019s entry. And all of that happened  after the  precedent we set. I ask the Assembly why the United Nations is unable to do the same in the case of the Republic of Macedonia. Are all States not equally sovereign? Is the United Nations more relevant for some peoples and less relevant for others?\nWe are once again seeing an unprincipled Athens victorious over a peace-loving Melos, showing that the stronger do what they can and the weaker do what they\n \nmust. The Prespa agreement puts us in a situation of fait accompli, in which we are told that we are smaller and weaker and must therefore accept the ultimatum of Athens. Instead of being rewarded for our peace-loving nature, we have been punished for it. It seems to have been forgotten that the United Nations was created by visionaries who wanted an order in which even the smallest and weakest of peoples would be protected, because respecting the rights of small peoples and States is a barometer of the observance of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nAristotle claimed that whoever is not part of the polis is either a beast or a god. What the individual used to be to the ancient cities is, in a way, what the State is to the international community today. Greece is acting as if it is not bound by the rules of the international order. With such an attitude, I wonder in which category Aristotle would classify the cradle of democracy in 2018. If the United Nations is incapable of giving force to a just law, then it only legitimizes improper force. An international order cannot be preserved by violating international law.\nFor a long time, we were persuaded  that  there was no other way. But through its fruit we recognized the tree. Through the Prespa agreement we have seen that we were misled into searching for a solution that would mean eroding the right to self-determination. How should we undo this complicated knot, this noose around our neck? The unravelling should begin where everything else began, with the violation of the right to self-determination.\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states very clearly that every agreement contrary to jus cogens standard is null and void. According to Article 1, paragraph 2, and Article 55 of the United Nations Charter, one of the rights that falls under the jus cogens standard is the right to self-determination. Article 5 of the 1995 Interim Accord specifies negotiations on the right to self-determination, which makes it contrary to the jus cogens standard, which means that the entire 1995 Interim Accord is null and void, as is the Prespa agreement that flows from it.\nNo one has the right to call into question the decision of a people to choose their names or the name of the country they create, which is a decision derived from the right to self-determination, which has been established as an absolute right of all peoples. Only the right to self-determination, and not its violation, can have an erga omnes effect.\nAs I am speaking in this Hall, in my country, the Republic of Macedonia, my fellow citizens are counting down the last hours to the holding of a referendum on the Prespa agreement, on which they have been asked to express themselves. In the past few weeks, many high-profile foreign representatives have visited the Republic of Macedonia. I know that many of them sincerely wish to help the Republic of Macedonia become part of the European Union and NATO, and I thank them for their good intentions from the bottom of my heart. However, I am afraid that they too have been misled. Their message is that if the referendum fails and the Prespa agreement is not accepted, we cannot hope for membership in NATO or the European Union. I say to them that if they take away our hope, what will we be left with? They must help us by unblocking the way for the Republic of Macedonia to accede to EU and NATO membership without violating the right to self- determination in the process.\nMany of those representatives have  been trying to persuade Macedonian citizens to accept the Greek proposal. I would like to ask them if they  would accept a derogation of the right to self-determination of their own peoples and countries. Would they accept interference in their internal affairs, or any other breach of their sovereignty and political independence? Why then are we being asked to accept something that no one else in the world would? They must stop trying to persuade us to eat this poisoned fruit. It is high time for the poisoned tree to be uprooted and its fruit discarded.\nIn the last few hours before the silence of the referendum, I therefore want to convey a message to my fellow citizens in the Republic of Macedonia. Voting on a referendum is their right, and it is not an obligation. In accordance with article 7, item 3 of our referendum law, no one shall be held responsible for voting or not voting in a referendum. Every citizen has the right to decide how to act with regard to the referendum, whether by going out and voting or staying at home and boycotting.\nJust as the referendum on 8 September 1991  led  to sovereignty and independence, the referendum on\n30 September may lead  to  a  state  of  subordination to another country and dependence on it,. If the referendum succeeds, then in accordance with the law not only will the country\u2019s existing name be changed,\n \na new, semi-sovereign country will be created, with a new name and a new internal and international legal identity. We will be a State only in name and not in substance, because others will have succeeded in regulating our way of life.\nHowever, if the referendum fails, a new possibility arises for discussing and exploring new options for resolving the issue, in accordance with international law and with respect for our fundamental right to self-determination. There will be an opportunity to renew the national consensus that  we  achieved  at  the beginning of our independence. It does not take courage to capitulate. It takes courage to persist in the realization of a country\u2019s right to self-determination and to preserving its sovereignty and independence. It takes courage to tell the truth.\nThis 30 September will be decisive for our future. And at the same time, for centuries, 30 September has traditionally been the day when we celebrate the faith, hope and love that arise from wisdom. I ask citizens not to lose faith in themselves, because the future of the Republic of Macedonia depends on them. They must not lose their hope and patriotic love for the Republic of Macedonia, because only as a sovereign and independent country can it be a guardian of their freedom and human dignity. As a citizen, I have made my decision. On 30 September, I will not go out to vote. I believe that my fellow citizens will make a  wise decision.\nI also want to address the representatives of States Members of the United Nations. This irrational dispute has had detrimental consequences  for  the  Republic of Macedonia and its citizens. Thanks to Greek blockades, we have been denied our right to prosperity. Unfortunately, all of that has had an impact on the sustainability of a multi-ethnic, multireligious and multilingual Macedonian society, a society that has actively contributed to peace, stability and security in the region and in Europe for the past 27 years.\nThe position of the authorities in Athens is contrary not only to international law and the decisions of Macedonian citizens, but also to the will of the almost 140 Member States  of  the  United  Nations that have recognized the Republic of Macedonia\u2019s fundamental right to self-determination of and to use its constitutional name. As President of the Republic of Macedonia, I urge all States that have already recognized the Republic of Macedonia and established\ndiplomatic relations under its constitutional name not to change their decision. They must demonstrate their sovereignty by remaining faithful to the principled decisions they have made, without any kind of pressure. They must help us by being the guardians of our right to self-determination, thereby safeguarding their own right to self-determination.\nModern history has shown that the Balkans is a birthplace of precedents. If we are subject to damaging precedents that limit our sovereignty and political independence, it is only a matter of time before such precedents are applied in other States. What does that say about the relevance of the United Nations for all people, about leadership and shared responsibility?\nI have always advocated and actively contributed to the building of a true and lasting partnership between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece, as well as friendship and trust between the Macedonian and Greek societies. However, if the only way to accommodate the irrational demands of the Greek side is through measures imposed on the Macedonian side, what we get are relations without trust. The agreement does not bring Macedonians and Greeks together but rather sets them apart.\nThe Greek and Macedonian societies should learn how to live together despite their deep differences. To reach a real, sustainable and lasting agreement, we need dialogue rather than monologue, arguments rather than ideas imposed by force and mutual respect rather than denial. Only by supporting that just  approach will the United Nations be relevant in our case and demonstrate leadership and shared responsibility. The United Nations can be relevant only if it respects its own principles.\nIt is possible that even as I speak statements are being written condemning my speech. Most often the first reaction to truth is hatred. Truth uncovers lies, unfulfilled promises and guilty consciences. And there are a lot of guilty consciences involved in the case of Macedonia. However, truth also liberates and enables us to accept guilt, to correct mistakes and heal the wounds from the violation  of  our fundamental right to self-determination and human dignity. The simple truth is that we are Macedonians and our country is the Republic of Macedonia. By respecting this simple truth of our identity, members of this organ respect our human dignity, which is enshrined in the foundations of freedom, justice and peace in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "In delivering my statement to the General Assembly at its seventy-third  session,  I  would  like to express my gratitude for the support of the United Nations to the  national political  dialogue under way in Honduras, undertaken at the initiative of several opposition leaders as well as my Government. Various political forces and civil society organizations are taking part in the national dialogue, which remains open to anyone wishing to participate. One of the main goals of the dialogue is to propose electoral reforms with a view to building a new model. Only yesterday, by 110 out of 128 votes, the National Congress of Honduras appointed a committee for modernizing and updating the national identification system from which the voter registry is established. As well,  the idea is to set  up  a new, modern and transparent technical system for authentic identification, all with a view to development.\nAs we meet at this great world forum and express our most sincere desire to work together as a team in order to build peace and find solutions, I also cannot avoid expressing my frustration at the lack of will and courage to make possible many of the ideas voiced here, despite the enormous size and amount of resources managed by the United Nations. Since the creation of the United Nations, it has been well established that respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of every State must be a priority for world peace. The principle of sovereign equality is crucial for the stability of the world. If we want to live in a harmonious system, we must comply with the pillars of the Organization, as reflected in the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe see international forces and actors constantly looking out for their own interests and interfering in our internal affairs, among other things, thereby affecting our democracy, which is a fundamental element for the development of nations that we are willing to defend. I say this today and I will say it tomorrow and always: it is necessary to protect the rule of law in our homeland. We live in new times with new realities and new challenges. The world demands great transformations and profound reforms. It is up to our current generation of leaders to live up to the demands of our peoples. That is an unavoidable responsibility.\nI should now like to speak about the reality in my country, Honduras. We have been one of the countries most impacted by extreme weather events over the past 20 years, ranking first in the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index. Despite being one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries, Honduran society as a whole has been working to combat the effects of climate change. Excessive bureaucracy has prevented access to financing from the vaunted green funds; were we to have access, it would allow us to undertake action and contribute to reforestation, conservation and mitigation. I am convinced that it is the obligation of\n \nthe United Nations and of each and every one of us to review and resolve as soon as possible the way those funds are used, rather than keeping them locked up in the vaults of the banks of the world. Every minute that those funds remain in bank vaults, the banking system gets richer and causes suffering to humankind.\nMigration is a human right. Human beings have been on the move and migrating for centuries, thereby contributing to the social and economic development of the countries that welcomed them as they sought better opportunities. Honduras and the Central American region are no exception. Unfortunately, in recent times the entire world has witnessed the cruelty with which migrants, including my compatriots, have been treated. We have all seen the subhuman conditions in which they are held in detention centres, which trample on the dignity inherent to the human person. That undignified treatment is in addition to the daily abuse that thousands of migrants receive along the route of terror from South America through Central America to the United States, where they are victims of all kinds of violations by criminal networks, whether they be called coyotes, human traffickers, drug traffickers, maras or gangs.\nI reaffirm that the principle of the dignity of the human person is a fundamental part of the Charter of the United Nations. We must act against the circumstances in which the most sacred institution of humankind, the family, is trampled upon and destroyed. With much pain, to date we continue to await the reunification of 120 separated children, who are being deprived of a right so basic and, at the same time, so fundamental for their development as is the family unit. The members of the Assembly  can  never  forget  the  commitment to universal and effective respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, in which the overriding interests of children must prevail. That is where we need diligence from senior United Nations officials and every Government of the world.\nEconomic integration in Central America has been a major dream that we have longed for  since 1951. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador took the initiative today to take a step towards fulfilling that goal by creating the first customs union in the Americas. Our region enjoys a privileged location, with maritime borders on both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, thereby acting as a link connecting the rest of the world to the Americas. Our objective is the establishment of a Central American common market, which entails the creation of a free trade zone and a common external tariff that establish the foundation for setting up a Central American customs union. That is one of those instances where the United Nations must become more aggressively involved.\nWe are working on integrating into that system the other countries of Central America, thereby enhancing a zone that holds great potential and enormous resources to be developed. Once fully established in Central America, that effort will make us the seventh-largest economy in Latin America. This model represents an opportunity to promote an American customs union that ensures the economic integration of the entire continent. Today, from this rostrum, I invite delegations, on the basis of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, and with the support of the Organization of American States, to turn the region into an area of peace, prosperity and free trade, like the one Moraz\u00e1n and Bol\u00edvar imagined.\nA customs union seeks to facilitate trade, but trade in which justice and fairness prevail. Today, the item at the top of the agenda of the United Nations is the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which in essence constitute a frontal attack on poverty. In the context of the commitments it has undertaken under the SDGs, my Government has  already  approved  the establishment of a national commission for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Still, the SDGs have sadly been interpreted as setting forth double standards, as millions of coffee producers \u2014 mainly the smallest ones, who are today receiving a price below their costs, which undoubtedly leads them in to extreme poverty \u2014 have witnessed. That is the case with approximately 90,000 coffee-producing families in my country, Honduras \u2014 and when I speak of my country, Honduras, in terms of coffee production, I am not talking about just any country, because we are the fifth- largest coffee producer in the world, the third-largest in America and the largest in Central America.\nI would like to ask members of delegations a question. How many of them have a cup of coffee in the morning or during the day? We know that there is a very high possibility that, without knowing it, they have participated in an enormous injustice. Since we are all promoters of the Sustainable Development Goals, we must not turn a deaf ear to the fact that generates\n \nextreme poverty. A cup of coffee in New York City can cost $5, or 500 cents. Do members of delegations know how much the small coffee producers in my country receive after working hard under the sun and rain, harvesting every single grain of coffee by hand? I want to tell them \u2014 these producers do not get even two cents for every cup of coffee, and it costs $5, or 500 cents, yielding barely two cents for the producer. Is this or is this not an injustice?\nI know that those who applaud recognize that it is an injustice. That cannot be. We cannot close our eyes, stop listening or cease allowing something to stir in our conscience and wake us up. That is why we are here.\nWe have been talking about the Sustainable Development Goals for a long time. However, I must ask, does it make sense to ignore the crisis that millions of small coffee producers are living through? In my country, there are only approximately 90,000, but in the Americas all together there are more than 14 million producers and in the world 25 million producer families, and millions more indirectly dependent on coffee production. We must act now \u2014 today.\nWhile the United Nations is taking action on this issue \u2014 I say this because I am convinced that it is going to take action on the issue \u2014 I call on all the Presidents of the coffee-producing countries and the coffee producers of the world to organize themselves, because it is clear that no one is in fact looking out for the interests of the world\u2019s poor small coffee producers.\nThe first time I had the honour of addressing the General Assembly, I said that the greatest tragedy that Honduras has suffered in the history of the Republic has been the wave of violence resulting from drug trafficking (see A/69/PV.7). Our country is a transit zone for drugs produced in the southern part of the continent and consumed in the north. In addition to the scourge of drug trafficking, gangs, youth gangs and criminal groups have in the past literally supplanted States themselves in several regions, countries and circumstances. In my country, there are armed non-State groups that, when affirmatively confronted by good Hondurans who desire to live in peace, and are the object of the Government\u2019s efforts to restore peace and security, go so far as to threaten electoral processes, democracy and the rule of law. It is my firm conviction that in Honduras these non-State actors are violating fundamental rights \u2014 the human rights \u2014 of thousands of  their compatriots. More  alarming is  the\nfact that I have repeatedly made this denunciation in other United Nations bodies and in the Organization of American States, and until today we have not received any answers.\nThat is why I wanted to clearly draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the issue. This situation should trigger alarms for States and specifically for the United Nations in the defence of the rule of law and representative democracy. I emphasize that it is a question of such fundamental rights as the right to life, freedom and the enjoyment of participatory democracy. Therefore, I take this opportunity to ask that delegations draft a resolution that recognizes that gangs, youth gangs and other criminal groups should be considered non-State entities that violate human rights and threaten the stability of States.\nAt a high cost and at great risk, we in Honduras decided to face this monstrous multiheaded challenge, and like very few countries in the region we have made progress, increasingly entrenching a climate of greater security and peace each day. But I can acknowledge that not enough has been done yet. That is why there can be no State Member of the United Nations that considers itself a supporter of democracy, pacifist or full of respect for life and does not heed our call, which is also the call of other peoples who have suffered under the same circumstances.\nWe must honour that generation that had the vision to create the General Assembly and ensure respect for the sovereignty of nations and the self-determination of peoples. I represent a country that, like every country, has problems and faces great challenges. I represent a country that is small in the size of its territory but great in dignity. I emphatically wish to say that I could not forgive myself coming to the General Assembly and not making an appeal to the conscience of world leaders to adopt a transcendent attitude, demanding that we pass from words to concrete actions that change the lives of the peoples of the world for the better.\nI call for the protection of our democracies and human rights from attacks by armed non-State actors, gangs, youth gangs and criminal groups. I call for respect for the principle of the best interests of the child and the family as the holiest institution of humankind. I call for leading by example when it comes to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, protecting the world\u2019s small coffee producers so that they receive what they deserve through a truly fair\n \ntrade, since this fair trade implies not only obligations for producers but also that their rights are respected, which is what access to a fair profit would be.\nIn Honduras, we are ready to move from words and promises on paper to action. In Honduras, we are ready to act through actions that bring results.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her auspicious election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session and wish her, on behalf of the President of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, every success in the implementation of the priorities of her mandate. Our congratulations also go to her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for the quality of the work accomplished during his term of office. Allow me also to pay special tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for his tireless efforts and strong determination to consolidate the important role of the United Nations.\nOur session opens in an international context marked by many challenges and uncertainties that are gradually eroding our ability to respond collectively and adequately to threats to international peace and security. In addition, there are challenges relating to humanitarian and health crises, extreme poverty, and violations of human rights and democratic values. The Organization we share and the world today seem to be losing their vocation to protect the most vulnerable, to promote a more just and inclusive global governance, and to build a true community of destiny among nations.\nThis observation justifies and makes essential the existence of the United Nations and reminds us that changes in the international scene and the successive shifts in international actors should not be to the detriment of  the  Organization. There  is  therefore an\nurgent need to speed up the modernization of our Organization and to consolidate the foundations of the Charter of the United Nations. Based on that important action, we welcome the aptly chosen theme of the general debate for this session of the General Assembly, namely, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d.\nLittle progress is being made, unfortunately, in the struggle against world hunger and extreme poverty, the increasing number of crises and human tragedies, and the flow of displaced persons and refugees, all of which continue to be significant sources of concern for the international community. The theme of this session is therefore relevant and constitutes a call to reinvent the action of the United Nations and the modes of collaboration among its Member States.\nThe challenges and uncertainties facing our world today must lead Member States to embrace a shared vision of the central role and value of the United Nations in shaping our collective responses. Member States must therefore be resolute in taking back the ownership of our universal Organization so that it remains an organization for all peoples, in accordance with the ideals of the founding fathers. In order to accomplish that, one of the priorities is to restore full moral authority to the United Nations, so that it can act and enforce its resolutions with the support of its Member States in all the wide-ranging fields of collective action at the service of all peoples.\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads and must meet various expectations that will shape its future and effectiveness. In that regard, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire believes, as President Alassane Ouattara has often said, that now is the time to reform the Security Council so that it can be more effective and more representative of today\u2019s world. Only a truly united Council can enable our Organization to effectively address major security issues such as the fight against nuclear proliferation, terrorism, mass crimes and crimes against humanity. At the same time, we must agree that the fight against global warming will be successful only if we fully accept that global warming is a threat to world peace and international security.\nThe solidarity that we ardently call for in the settlement of conflicts must not be selective or be limited to mere declarations of intent. We must in all circumstances reach a minimum moral and political\n \nconsensus, allowing our Organization not to remain unmoved by the sight of the faces ravaged by the devastating effects of conflicts, wars and endemic diseases that we see daily on our television screens. Such a consensus must also enable the Organization to play an important role in promoting conflict prevention and strengthening democratic institutions as the only means of combating  rivalries  between  neighbours, as well as political, ethnic and religious tensions and border conflicts.\nThe responsibility of the United Nations for a new commitment to action should continue to expand based on the principle of the responsibility to protect, which became a standard of public international law when it was adopted by all Member States at the 2005 World Summit. I would  like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to our late former Secretary- General Kofi Annan, who  died  on  18  August,  for his commitment to the success of that Summit. My delegation celebrates the memory of that worthy son of Africa, who was one of the most remarkable figures in the history of the United Nations.  His  vast  and rich experience of international issues contributed, through his numerous initiatives and actions, to the strengthening of international peace and security.\nWe must keep in mind that no collective security system can be viable unless we seek to eradicate the main causes of the sociopolitical unrest apparent in many States, in particular extreme poverty. While there is no doubt that the United Nations is focusing more and more on economic issues, it is imperative that we step up action on the social level, which is essential. Humankind should be more at the heart of our concerns, as has been reflected in the focus of the major questions that have been the subject of the conferences organized on major issues, such as the protection of children, the protection of women, population and development, and human rights. Unfortunately, however, those meetings yielded few concrete results.\nThat is why C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire invites the international community to implement the relevant resolutions adopted during this cycle of  thematic  conferences that recognize the need to reject widespread poverty and combat illiteracy and endemic diseases, famine, malnutrition and other disparities. Otherwise, it is feared that some States facing large disparities will become breeding grounds or sanctuaries for terrorist groups, money-laundering centres or hubs for the illegal international transit and trafficking of drugs.\nThe human dimension embraced by the Ivorian Government in drawing up its  development  policy has consisted of taking measures to ensure a better distribution of the benefits of strong economic growth and a more effective struggle against poverty. The significant investments devoted to infrastructure and the social sectors have made it possible to improve access to education, water, electricity and health care, leading to a significant reduction in the rate of poverty. In order to enhance and accelerate that momentum, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has given itself the means through its second national development plan for 2016-2020, to mobilize the necessary resources to the tune of $60 billion. We have also adopted important security measures in the fight against the global threats that face all countries in the region.\nThe challenges posed by unregulated migratory flows concern all of us, and we call for the concerted management of that significant issue, which affects mainly young people from Africa. The stance taken by C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on that matter, which is shared by most countries in our region, has always been that the problem must be tackled principally from the development point of view. Only the work and development opportunities that are offered to our young people so that they can forge a future on their native soil can resolve the issue in a sustainable way.\nThat stance is bolstered by the fact that 26 per cent of those living in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are foreign nationals, as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire receives a significant share of regional migration flows. There is no  denying  that the management of the migration crisis requires a commitment from the countries of origin,  transit  and arrival. That is the only way  in which  we  will  be able to effectively fight against human trafficking and find appropriate solutions to irregular migration, as advocated by the African Union-European Union Summit held in 2017 in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nIt is through the accelerated implementation  of the major reforms set out in Agenda 2063 that Africa can become the new frontier for development. Finally, in seeking solutions to the challenges we face, our collective intelligence dictates that we cooperate  in the framework of a more cohesive, democratic and efficient Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me join previous speakers in conveying our congratulations to the President for her election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nEvery year, this forum provides a suitable platform for Member States to broach critical issues of international peace and security and their ramifications for national and human development. In that spirit, I would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to key matters of paramount importance to my country and our region as a whole.\nAs those present are all aware, Eritrea and Ethiopia recently signed a historic peace agreement ending a dark two-decade chapter of war, constant tension and strife. This historic achievement, even if it is almost  16 years late, will enable both countries to funnel their resources, potential and positive energy exclusively towards much-needed development. It has already given the peoples of both countries hope and optimism. The positive dividend for regional peace and security that it has generated is so clear that it does not need emphasis. It is clearly attested to by the new frameworks of all- around cooperation that have been set in motion in the past two months or are in the offing at the regional level. Eritrea would like to express its gratitude to the several countries that contributed in various ways and demonstrated their political goodwill in support of the success of the historical process under way.\nLet me now turn to a perplexing injustice that has afflicted my country for almost a decade. I am referring to the unwarranted sanctions that were imposed on Eritrea in 2009 and 2011. With the positive winds of peace blowing in our region, several Security Council members are now calling for the immediate lifting of those deplorable sanctions. However, the diplomatic discourse is not completely coherent. As it happens, some countries are coming up with procedural and other pretexts and preconditions with the apparent aim of moving the goalposts and maintaining the illegal sanctions on Eritrea. As an aggrieved party that has been on the receiving end of a miscarriage of justice\n \nfor nine long years, Eritrea cannot and will not plead for clemency or magnanimity. The people and the Government of Eritrea will continue to stand up for their rights until justice is achieved and the wrongs done to them have been redressed.\nThe transgressions against Eritrea are in many ways symptomatic of the hubris and perverse power games that have largely governed international relations in recent times. The spiralling crises, instability, wars and conflicts that have raged, and continue to do so, in various parts of the world are the inevitable consequences of an absence of justice. They are the attendant outcomes of an international power imbalance. When the rule of law is suppressed and supplanted by the logic of force, and when the global power balance is compromised, the inevitable outcomes are intractable crises and escalating wars.\nIt was against that disconcerting global backdrop that Eritrea was first victimized and targeted by unlawful and unfair sanctions, on 23 December 2009. I will not burden the Assembly with the details of the incontrovertible facts of how and why the sanctions were imposed, since all the relevant information, including confidential communications, WikiLeaks and all, has long since been in the public domain and available for scrutiny. However, to sum up, the interplay of forces and factors that resulted in the sanctions was this.\nFirst, the principal architects of the sanctions  were United States Administrations that felt that they could use their unassailable power and raw coercion to ram punitive measures against  a  small  country and people through  the  Security  Council  in  order  to advance their misguided regional agenda. In that context, is worth remembering that  certain officials in those Administrations had considered imposing similar sanctions on Eritrea in 1999 and 2000, at the height of the border war with Ethiopia, in order to impose asymmetrical arrangements by coercive means. The fabricated charges peddled in 2009 were in fact improvised attempts at implementing an overall agenda.\nThe second reason for the imposition of sanctions was the inability of the United Nations system to prevent such wrongs from happening, in particular systemic flaws and political horse-trading in the operations of the Security Council. In that context, too, one must remember that the Council failed to take any meaningful action against Ethiopia, despite the fact  that  previous  Ethiopian  regimes  had flagrantly\nviolated the Charter of the United Nations and the Algiers Agreement guaranteed by the same Security Council when they refused to abide by the final and binding decisions of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission of 13 April 2002.\nA third factor that drove the imposition of sanctions was the fact that the Governments in place at that time served the agenda of the major Powers. In the case of Eritrea, the principal architects of the sanctions against it resorted to regional Trojan horses designed to mask their resolutions with an African face.\nThe sanctions imposed on Eritrea for the past nine years have resulted in considerable economic damage to the country and unnecessary hardships for our people. The related smear and defamation campaigns have done immeasurable damage to the country\u2019s reputation and to the prospects and potential of investment. Perhaps the most significant damage is the regional instability and insecurity that this state of affairs has bred and exacerbated. The actual costs incurred and the opportunities forfeited, at both the national and regional levels, are therefore huge.\nIn the light of the widely acclaimed peace and cooperation that have been brokered in the region, the fact that certain countries are choosing to ignore the stark truth and prolong the sanctions regime in Eritrea is astounding. Over the past six decades, the Eritrean people have waged a long and difficult struggle to advance the cause of justice and foster a climate that  is conducive to mutual security and stability in the region. Those robust convictions and that legacy have enabled them to withstand all the wrongs and scars imposed on them by the unfair sanctions. Through their characteristic resilience and hard toil, they have now vanquished the injustices inflicted on them.\nIn conclusion, as I stressed earlier, the people of Eritrea have not committed any crime or transgression that impels them to seek clemency. As such, they are not only calling for the immediate rescinding of the sanctions but they are also asking, and deserve, amends for the damages incurred and opportunities forfeited.\n"

        "file_text": "It is impossible to stand here speaking from this rostrum on behalf of Cuba and not recall historic moments before the General Assembly that are among our most cherished memories. Fidel Castro, Ernesto Guevara, Ra\u00fal Castro Ruz and the Chancellor of Dignity, Ra\u00fal Roa, to mention only the most illustrious, here raised their voices on behalf not only of our people but also of other non-aligned peoples of Latin America and Caribbean, Africa and Asia,  together  with  whom  we have fought for more than half  a  century for  a  fair international order, that is still far from having been achieved.\nThat failure is absurd but consistent with the irrationality of a world in which the richest 0.7 per cent of the population can claim 46 per cent of all wealth, while the poorest 70 per cent of the population has access to only 2.7 per cent of that wealth, 3.46 billion people survive in poverty, 821 million live in hunger, 758 million are illiterate and 844 million lack basic services, such as drinking water. All these  figures are, of course, prepared and  regularly  manipulated by global organizations, but it seems that they have failed to raise sufficient awareness among the so-called international community.\nThese facts are not the result  of  socialism,  as  the President of the United States said in this Hall\n \nyesterday (see A/73/PV.6). They are consequences of capitalism, especially imperialism and neoliberalism, of the egoism and exclusion inherent to that system, and of an economic, political, social and cultural paradigm that concentrates wealth in the hands of a minority as a significant majority pay the price through exploitation and poverty.\nCapitalism financed colonialism; gave rise to fascism, terrorism and apartheid; and  spread  war and conflict, violations of the sovereignty or self- determination of peoples, and the repression of workers, minorities, refugees and migrants. Capitalism runs counter to solidarity and democratic participation. The patterns of production and consumption characteristic of capitalism promote plundering and militarism, threaten peace, lead to violations of human rights; and pose the greatest danger to the ecological balance of the planet and the survival of the human race.\nNo one should mistakenly believe that humankind lacks the material, financial or technological resources to eradicate poverty, hunger, preventable diseases and other scourges. What is missing is political will among the industrialized countries, which have the moral duty, the historical responsibility and abundant resources to solve the most pressing global problems. The truth is that while funding shortfalls are cited as justification for failing to attain the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development or address the increasing impacts of climate change, $1.74 trillion was wasted on military expenditure in 2017 \u2014 the highest figure since the end of the Cold War.\nClimate change is another unavoidable reality and a question of survival for the human race, especially for small island developing States. Some of its effects are already irreversible. Scientific evidence shows that the average temperature has increased by 1.1\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels, and that nine out of 10 people living in urban areas breathe polluted air. However, the United States, one of the major polluters, both historically and today, refuses to join the international community in implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In so doing, it endangers the very lives of future generations and the survival of all species, including humans.\nFurthermore, as if there were not enough threats to humankind and its dazzling creations, it is a fact that military and nuclear hegemony not only continues but is extending its reach, dashing the hopes of the majority\nof peoples for general and complete disarmament. Cuba shares this ideal and, as evidence of its commitment to that aim, on 31 January became the fifth State to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nIt is impossible for the Organization, born of the desire to overcome through dialogue among nations the destruction wrought by an horrific war, to remain silent about the dangers that threaten us all with the exacerbation of local conflicts, wars of aggression disguised as humanitarian intervention, the forceful overthrow  of  sovereign  Governments,   so-called soft coups and interference in other States\u2019 internal affairs \u2014 all of which are established behaviours on the part of certain Powers, under a wild range of pretexts.\nInternational cooperation to promote and protect human rights for all is imperative, but it is manipulated in a discriminatory and selective way in an attempt to dominate, violating the rights of peoples to peace, self- determination and development.\nCuba rejects the militarization of outer space and cyberspace, as well as the covert and illegal use of information and communication technologies to attack other States.\nMultilateralism and full respect for the norms and principles of international law to advance towards a democratic, equitable multipolar world are necessary to ensure peaceful coexistence, maintain international peace and security and find lasting solutions to systemic problems.\nRunning counter to  this  vision,  threats  or  use of force, unilateralism, pressure, retaliation and sanctions \u2014 which increasingly characterize the behaviour and rhetoric of the United States Government and its abusive use of the veto power in the Security Council to impose its political agenda \u2014 represent immense challenges that threaten the very institution of the United Nations. Why do we not simply implement the promised strengthening of the General Assembly as the principal deliberative, decision-making and most representative organ? Security Council reform must not be delayed or sidelined; it must be updated to reflect the times and democratize its membership and working methods.\nWe reiterate today what Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban revoluation Fidel Castro Ruz said on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. His\n \nsentiments reflect the most noble aspirations of the majority of humankind:\n\u201cWe lay claim to a world without hegemonism, without nuclear weapons, without interventionism, without racism, without national or religious hatred, without outrageous acts against the sovereignty of any country, a world with respect for the independence and self-determination of peoples, a world without universal models that totally disregard the traditions and culture of all the components of mankind.\n\u201cWe lay claim to a world without ruthless blockades that cause the death of men, women  and children, young and old, like noiseless atom bombs.\u201d (A/50/PV.35, pp. 19-20)\nMore than 20 years have passed since that  demand was made, and none of those ills has been cured; on the contrary, they have got worse. We  have  every right to ask why and the duty to insist on effective and fair solutions.\nOur Americas are today the scene of persistent threats that are incompatible with the proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace, signed in Havana in 2014 by the Heads of State and Government at the second Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. The current United States Administration has proclaimed the validity of the Monroe Doctrine and, in a new deployment of its imperial policy in the region, is attacking Venezuela with particular cruelty.\nIn this menacing climate, we reiterate our absolute support for the Bolivarian and Chavista  revolution, the civic-military union of the Venezuelan  people  and its legitimate democratic Government, led by Constitutional President  Nicol\u00e1s  Maduros  Moros. We reject the interventionist intent of the sanctions against Venezuela, aimed at economic strangulation and damaging Venezuelan families. We reject calls to isolate that sovereign nation, which is doing no harm to anyone.\nWe likewise reject the attempts to destabilize the Government of Nicaragua, a peaceful country that has made remarkable social and economic progress and improved security for its citizens.\nWe denounce the political imprisonment of former\nPresident  Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula  da Silva  and  the decision\nto prevent the people from voting for Brazil\u2019s most popular leader and electing him to the presidency.\nWe stand in solidarity with the Caribbean nations demanding legitimate reparations for the horrific legacy of slavery as well as the fair, special and differential treatment they deserve.\nWe reaffirm our long-standing support for the self-determination and independence of the brotherly people of Puerto Rico.\nWe support Argentina\u2019s legitimate claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands.\nWe reiterate our full support for a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the establishment of two States, permitting the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination in a sovereign independent State based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We reject the unilateral action of the United States in establishing its diplomatic representation in the city of Jerusalem, which has further heightened tensions in the region. We condemn the barbarous acts committed by the Israeli forces against the civilian population in Gaza.\nWe reaffirm our steadfast solidarity with the Sahrawi people and support the questfor a definitive solution to the question of Western Sahara that allows them to exercise their right to self-determination and to live in peace in their territory.\nWe support the search for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the situation imposed on Syria, without foreign interference and in full respect for the country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We reject any direct or indirect intervention executed without the agreement of the legitimate authorities of that country.\nThe  continued  expansion  of  NATO  towards  the Russian border is provoking significant danger, aggravated further still by the imposition of arbitrary sanctions, which we reject.\nWe demand that the nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran be implemented.\nWe welcome the process of inter-Korean rapprochement   and   dialogue,   which   represents the path towards lasting peace, reconciliation and stability on the Korean peninsula. At the same time, we strongly condemn the imposition of unilateral\n \nand unjust sanctions against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and foreign interference in Korean internal affairs.\nThe violation of international trade rules, and the imposition of sanctions against China, the European Union and other countries will result in harmful effects, in particular for developing countries.\nWe favour dialogue and cooperation, thanks to which we can report today that the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Cuba has provisionally entered into force, representing a strong foundation on which to build beneficial ties between the parties.\nThe Government of the United States maintains its aggressive rhetoric towards Cuba and a policy aimed at subverting the political, social, economic and cultural system of my country. Contrary to the interests  of both peoples and giving in to pressure from minority interests, the United States Government has engaged in fabricating pretexts to stoke false tensions and hostilities that benefit no one. This is in stark contrast with the fact that we maintain  formal  diplomatic  relations and participate in mutually beneficial cooperation programmes in a limited number of areas. Our peoples share increasingly close historical and cultural bonds, as expressed through the arts, sports, science and the environment, among other areas. The potential for a healthy commercial relationship is well recognized, and a genuine relationship of respect would benefit the interests of the entire region.\nHowever, the defining core component of the bilateral relationship remains the embargo, which is intended to strangle the Cuban economy, generate poverty and disrupt constitutional order. It is a cruel policy that punishes Cuban families and the entire nation. It is the most comprehensive and long-standing system of economic sanctions ever implemented against any country. It has been and remains a major obstacle to the country\u2019s development  and to the realization   of the aspirations for progress and well-being of several generations of Cubans. As reiterated from this very rostrum for many years, through its aggressive extraterritorial implementation the embargo seriously damages the sovereignty and interests of all countries.\nOn behalf of the Cuban people, I thank the General Assembly for its near-unanimous rejection of the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against my country. However,\nthat Government\u2019s actions against my country go even further, to include public and covert programmes of gross interference in Cuba\u2019s internal affairs, using tens of millions of dollars officially allocated in the budget to that purpose, in violation of the norms and principles upon which this Organization is based and, in particular, of Cuba\u2019s sovereignty as an independent nation.\nCuba stands ready to foster respectful and civilized relations with the United States Government, based on sovereign equality and mutual respect. That is the will of the Cuban people and an aspiration that we know to be shared by the majority of the citizens of the United States, especially the Cubans living there.\nWe will continue tirelessly demanding the end of the cruel economic, commercial and financial embargo, the return of the territory illegally occupied by the United States Naval Base in Guant\u00e1namo and adequate compensation to our people for the thousands of deaths and injuries and the economic and property damage caused by this aggression over so many years.\nCuba will always remain willing to engage in dialogue and cooperation based on respect and equal treatment. We will never make concessions that affect our national sovereignty and independence. We will not barter our principles or accept conditions. In spite of the embargo, the hostility and actions of the United States to impose regime change on Cuba, the Cuban revolution remains alive and strong, steadfast and faithful to its principles.\nThe enemies of the revolution should not be deluded by the generational change in our Government. We represent continuity, not any sort of rupture. Cuba has continued taking steps to improve its model of economic and social development with a view to building a sovereign, independent, socialist, democratic, prosperous and sustainable nation. That is the path that our people havefreely chosen. The Cuban people will never return to the disgraces of the past, from which it freed itself by the greatest of sacrifices over 150 years of struggle for independence and dignity. In accordance with the will of the overwhelming majority of Cuban women and men, we shall press forward in the work that began almost 60 years ago.\nIn this conviction, we have initiated a process of constitutional reform \u2014 a truly participatory democratic exercise with public discussion of the draft text which will later be submitted for approval by referendum. I am certain that there will be no changes in our strategic\n \nobjectives and that the irrevocable nature of socialism will be reaffirmed. The principles of our foreign policy will remain unchanged. As the First Secretary of our Party, Mr. Ra\u00fal Castro Ruz, said, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations:\n\u201cThe international community can always depend on Cuba to raise its honest voice against injustice,\tinequality,\tunderdevelopment, discrimination and manipulation and for the establishment of a more equitable and fair international order that really focuses on the human being, his dignity and well-being.\u201d (A/70/ PV.14, p.6)\nThe Cuba on behalf of which I speak today is proud to carry the torch of that independent sovereign policy, which is bound by links of brotherhood and solidarity to the world\u2019s poor, who produce all the world\u2019s wealth but are condemned to live in poverty by an unjust world order under the cover of words like \u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201chuman rights\u201d \u2014 words which those in power have, in fact, emptied of all meaning.\nI am moved to be speaking from the same rostrum from which Fidel spoke the truth so powerfully 58 years ago that it still resonates with the representatives of more than 190 nations who, rejecting extortion and pressure, year on year turn the voting screen a dignified green with lights approving our demand for  an end  to the embargo. I close with the hope that the noble aspirations shared by the majority of humankind may be realized before yet further generations take to this rostrum to demand the very same things we demand today and our historic predecessors did before us.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great privilege for me to stand before the General Assembly today in New York. We are gathered here because of\n \nthose who believed, following the tragedy of the Second World War, that an international order based on rules and dialogue, rather than on relationships of power, would lead us to peace and prosperity. They were right. Given the considerable challenges and transformations we must face in the world today, no person or country has the capacity to stand alone. By that I mean globalization, inequality, war and internal conflict, as well as extremism, migration flows and climate change, and even health crises and the digital revolution. It is our shared responsibility \u2014 the responsibility of each and every State Member of the United Nations \u2014 to ensure that international institutions and organizations are up to the task of supporting us in this endeavour. Unfortunately, there seems to be a tendency at the moment to seek the answers to these problems in nationalist isolation and in increasing mistrust with regard to cooperation between States.\nWe are seeing a new international order take shape, with new actors and a new middle class. According to the World Bank, between 1990 and 2015 \u2014 in a single generation \u2014 the number of people affected by extreme poverty fell from 2 billion to 700  million,  a  result that can be described as exceptional. What is of great concern to us today, however, is that these changes have gone hand in hand with the erosion of the international system founded on the rule of law. I believe that we  are witnessing a real crisis in multilateralism, perhaps paradoxically at the very moment when we are trying to forge the main pillars of the global governance of the future. As a country that is interconnected and open  to the world, Switzerland understands the value of a working international legal order based on exchange and multi-stakeholder dialogue, which guarantees stability and is consistent with Swiss values as they are set out in our Constitution.\nThere are crises currently ongoing in many parts of the world, some of which have been there for  a  very long time, particularly the Middle East, where re-engaging in dialogue is the only option. Switzerland is working for a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians in accordance with international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions, based on a negotiated two-State solution.\nThe conflict in Syria has entered its eighth year, with no real end in sight. The basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law and human rights are not being respected. In recent months the conflict has intensified further on various fronts. More than\n13 million men, women and children in Syria are dependent on humanitarian aid. It is essential that we step up our efforts to find a political solution to the conflict. Only a negotiated solution that includes all sectors of Syrian society can guarantee lasting peace and sustainable reconstruction in Syria and the region as a whole.\nIn Yemen, too, the conflict has been going on for years. The armed conflict has deprived millions of people of water, food and medical care. Switzerland calls on all parties to cease hostilities and come  to the negotiating table to seek solutions to end this humanitarian crisis. In that regard, Switzerland remains ready and willing to play its part \u2014 for example, by hosting peace talks in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations.\nLarge-scale health crises accompany all of those conflicts. The spread of disease, especially in war zones and refugee camps, is a major burden on weakened or ruined health systems. In that regard, it is vital to protect health-care facilities and personnel in order to maintain working health systems and access to medical care.\nThe United Nations is truly the cornerstone of peaceful coexistence between all States, in accordance with the rules we have established together. It is indispensable and, above all, ideally placed to tackle contemporary challenges, especially the fight against inequality. To fulfil that role, the United Nations must be strong. If it is to make the maximum impact with the means at its disposal, it must adapt to an ever-changing environment and constantly re-examine its working methods. Switzerland is therefore an active supporter of the reform programmes launched by Secretary- General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Those reforms, in the areas of peace and security, development and management, aim to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of the United Nations in the face of current global challenges. We are engaged on multiple fronts. Today  I  would like to address the following points. I shall begin by addressing the Sustainable Development Goals.\nSwitzerland is working  actively  to implement the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable  Development  and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We have been working to put a robust monitoring mechanism in place to provide for voluntary national reviews and report  on progress made towards achieving the Goals. More specifically, we have contributed, with other countries, to providing better statistical data. We are also engaging\n \nwith innovative projects in areas such as health care, education, energy and innovation. Nonetheless, we are all aware that there is still work to be done to combat global warming and the negative environmental impacts of economic development.\nI want to take this opportunity to stress the essential contribution of culture and cultural diversity to building a sustainable and successful society. Without a policy of culture, there is no economic, social or environmental sustainability. Culture must therefore occupy a central place in development policies. In January, more than 30 countries reaffirmed culture\u2019s essential contribution to our lives, as well as the importance of culture overall, in the Davos declaration.\nSecondly, with regard to the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court, respect for human dignity and fundamental rights is not optional but rather an obvious necessity for stable and sustainable development. Switzerland strongly supports the work of the Human Rights Council and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, both based in Geneva, with a view to enabling them  to fulfil their duty to promote, strengthen and protect human rights in the world. International cooperation is also essential in preventing conflict and establishing a framework for lasting peace. I would like to mention in particular the fight against impunity. Switzerland worked for the adoption of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the International Criminal Court, exactly 20 years ago. We will continue to support that unique international cooperative effort at the service of the victims of the most serious crimes.\nThirdly, I would like to speak about Geneva and the good offices of Switzerland. We intend to continue to build bridges, support negotiations and mediation and use our diplomacy and good offices to help countries and international and regional organizations find solutions to conflicts and create space for new reflections and new topics. In Geneva, Switzerland makes all of the preparations needed so that discreet peace talks, of  the kind undertaken by the parties to  the  conflicts  in Syria and Yemen, can take place. Geneva is also home to several United Nations agencies \u2014 the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization \u2014 in addition to numerous international organizations. Geneva can therefore serve as a platform for dialogue on new challenges at the interface between politics,  society,  innovation,  science  and  economy. I would mention in particular of the areas of Internet\ngovernance and digitalization. Those topics develop and increasingly require synergies and dialogue between the traditional arenas of international action. However, Switzerland\u2019s role is not limited to Geneva. For example, we have actively contributed to the process of negotiating the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and we are grateful for the trust placed in Switzerland in that regard. The management of migration flows at the global level is an enormous undertaking that necessitates the participation of all the relevant stakeholders. Policies relying on trade protectionism and selfish interests are enjoying a certain popularity at present. They would like us to believe that the world is a zero- sum game and that there are no winners without losers. However, today, as in the past, withdrawal, protectionism, threats and violence will not provide answers to the dysfunctions and disparities of the world in which we live. Worse still, such policies can lead only to a drop in trade and, ultimately, a decline in prosperity. They nurture mistrust and isolation, which obstruct   knowledge-sharing,   competition and innovation. Our world will become all the more impoverished, both spiritually and culturally, and we will set off alone in search of solutions for problems that can only be solved together.\nThe current malaise serves as a warning that we must do everything we can to prevent a world in which we look out only for ourselves, and to encourage a world of cooperation between States, in which we strive for the common good, for causes such as peace, sustainable development and environmental protection. We can overcome the challenges and causes of growing inequality, demographic change or migration only if we approach them with a spirit of mutual trust. All States are winners if we see others as potential partners instead of competitors. All States are stronger if the international situation is more stable. The world is not a zero-sum game. To the contrary, it is a positive-sum game.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my privilege and honour once again to address the General\n \nAssembly on behalf of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. At the outset, allow me to congratulate the President on her election to lead this body at this most significant time and as the first woman to assume the post from the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. I assure her of my country\u2019s fullest support during her tenure.\nDuring the opening days of this session of the General Assembly we paid tribute to the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, whom we remember dearly, and what he said about the United Nations, namely, that it was critical in the international community\u2019s efforts to solve the wide range of global problems. Multilateralism, with the United Nations system at its fulcrum, has long informed our global engagements. The United Nations has been, is and will continue to be critical to global peace, progress and prosperity. That is why there is a need to move urgently to reform the United Nations, making it more responsive to the needs and concerns of all, in particular small island developing States (SIDS).\nThe United Nations has become too preoccupied with summitry, that is, with specialized high-level meetings and declarations, and less focused on delivery. The lack of cooperation among Member States stymies the  forward  march  of  humankind.  A reformed United Nations must become a body of greater action and fewer words. We need urgent action on climate change, non-communicable diseases, global cooperation, peace, prosperity and the reordering of the international financial system. Guided by this year\u2019s theme, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, my delegation is of the view that those ideas can enable us to address the unfairness and inequity of the international development order, and we urge a new and more inclusive paradigm of equitable and sustainable development.\nAlthough it is the smallest country in the western hemisphere, my country has always had  its  own goals, since long before the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals were announced. More than a week ago, we celebrated 35 years of independence. We have made significant progress towards alleviating poverty, providing free primary and secondary education, ensuring access to affordable health care and enhancing the standard of living for our citizens and residents.\nAll those gains could be erased by the phenomenon of climate change. The damage  sustained  last  year by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States subregion as a result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria was unimaginable. The high-level pledging conference in the aftermath of  those hurricanes was an attempt  to chart the way forward towards creating resilience and better recovery. We ask that Member States with commitments still outstanding  fulfil  them  as  soon as practicable. We applaud those countries that have redeemed their pledges. There is still a great deal  to be done to restore affected Member States, but that requires strong, meaningful and enduring international partnerships.\nWe continue to highlight, on the one hand, our inherent  vulnerabilities  to natural   disasters  and, on the other hand, an unflinching determination to maintain a sustainable society. Our responsibility is clear. Individually and collectively, we must commit  to reducing the amount  of  harmful  materials  that we emit into the environment. It is a matter of great concern that nations such as my own continue to pay dearly for a problem that we did not create. Our people see the impact of climate change on their lives and livelihoods. Climate change is largely the consequence of the actions of the more developed countries, their carbon emissions and harmful lifestyles, yet SIDS pay an unfair price \u2014 a price so high that, for many of us, climate change presents an existential threat.\nIn that connection, how will the United Nations assist our region with the growing prevalence of the\n \nsargassum seaweed that has adversely impacted the Caribbean area and is thought to be a noxious side effect of global warming? Sargassum affects our marine environment, in particular our coastal fisheries, and has affected the revenues of the fisherfolk in the region. Hotels, beaches and other tourism-related activities have  also  been  severely  impacted.  It  is my fervent hope that my plea today for international intervention will bring some relief to the people of our region. We must hold countries accountable for the environmental degradation that they cause not  only  in their own jurisdictions but also in other States. The United Nations system presents the best vehicle to do that.\nWe welcome the funding mechanisms established to assist countries, particularly highly vulnerable SIDS. However, the process must be transparent, easily accessible and, most importantly,  the  commitments of donor countries must bear fruit. That said, the international community cannot on the one  hand claim to be helping SIDS, while at the same time classifying us as middle- and high-income countries based on archaic financial models that ultimately deny access to critical developmental assistance and hinder investment financing. We reiterate our calls for the international community to address with urgency the sterile measure of per capita income now employed. It is equally important to address the issues of disaster-risk insurance and recognition of the unique vulnerabilities of small States. My country remains  committed  to the Sustainable Development Goals and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway.\nThe developmental efforts of small States are also being thwarted by an unfair financial architecture, which includes the threat of  de-risking and the loss   of correspondent banking  relationships. That is compounded by the very discriminatory and irrational blacklisting of countries that are forced to divert scarce resources to address the onerous and arbitrary demands of the European Union\u2019s Code of Conduct Group for business taxation and other entities created by large, highly developed countries. It is completely unfair to subject some countries to such evaluation and ever- fluctuating standards, while others are exempt.\nThe threats to the survival of small States  are real. I therefore call on this body to bring the plight of small States like Saint Kitts and Nevis to the forefront of international discourse and to bring an end to the discriminatory policies that I have mentioned. At great\ncost, my  country and other small States seek to rise  to the challenges posed by the unfair international financial architecture. However, the frequency and arbitrariness of those unilateral demands derail essential development efforts in small States. I submit to this body that we deserve and have a right to expect fairness, transparency and consistency in the treatment of all States. A clear, rules-based financial system that applies to all States must be our collective goal.\nMy Government is mindful that without peace, there can be no shared prosperity. We have aggressively confronted the problem of crime and violence on several fronts. We condemn all acts of violence and support efforts to maintain peace. My Government will use every resource available to achieve a stable, peaceful and equitable society, which is what our people expect and certainly deserve. Saint Kitts and Nevis supports the calls for diplomacy aimed at addressing the conflicts around the world and is particularly heartened by the welcome dialogue on the Korean peninsula. The Caribbean is a zone of peace, and our clear philosophy is to promote peace, friendship and dialogue while avoiding conflict with other territories. In that regard, a denuclearized world is a most desirable objective for all humankind.\nThroughout the Caribbean, we suffer from an increase in crime connected to the trade in small arms, light weapons and drugs. Those weapons flow into the Caribbean, where they are not manufactured, and are linked to an insatiable drug appetite in the West. It is beyond our power to unilaterally control the flow of guns into the region or the addiction that drives the dangerous global drug trade. We seek the assistance  of the international community as we work tirelessly to address that scourge. My country remains fully committed to the Arms Trade Treaty. Our increasing internal budget allocations are an indication of our commitment to the maintenance of safety and security.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is  delighted  that  this week, this body joined in committing to scaling up multi-stakeholder and multisectoral responses aimed at the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our region remains encumbered by the unfortunate burden that the NCDs have placed on our society and economy. The statistics are stark and startling. Eight of every 10 deaths in the Caribbean are attributable to NCDs, 40 per cent of which are premature and 70 per cent of that number are\n \npreventable. Hypertension is our leading risk factor for death. The Caribbean region\u2019s diabetes rate is double the global rate. We are facing an NCD crisis in our region. In that regard, we applaud the launch earlier this week of the Defeat-NCD Partnership, and the Caribbean Community and the Caribbean Public Health Agency will provide the fullest support to that new partnership.\nWe endorse a holistic approach to health, and I am happy to report that we have moved into high gear to make universal health coverage, which is an essential component of global health, a reality for  all citizens  in Saint Kitts and Nevis. However, I must remind the Assembly that NCDs and climate change are two sides of the same coin. They are symptoms of the failure of the current development paradigm.\nMy Government believes in making an equitable society a reality for all citizens in Saint Kitts and Nevis. In keeping with our commitment to transform our world through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we have endeavoured to create an equitable pathway by improving the standard of living of the most vulnerable so that they can become self-sufficient and productive citizens and residents.\nI cannot address this great body without recognizing our dear friend, Taiwan. My Government views the United Nations as an organization for all people, including the people of Taiwan. We strongly believe that Taiwan has an important and continuing role to play in international development strategies, as it has achieved great success in technology, agriculture, health and renewable energy. We advocate that Taiwan be given space to add to the dialogue, progress and well-being of the global community. We also continue to voice our support for our Caribbean sister, Cuba, and call for the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States of America in order to alleviate the real suffering caused to the Cuban people by the policy of exclusion. My country is conscious of the current difficulties in Venezuela. Venezuela has been a very good friend to the Caribbean, and Saint Kitts and Nevis continues to call for peaceful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues in that country, with due regard to the rule of law and the democratic ideals that we hold dear.\nAs I conclude, I must remind the Assembly that our people want action. They want results. We need to see all global leaders come together to create and maintain stability, equality and peace in our countries so that\nour collective contributions can prevent and avoid war and violence, end the proliferation of nuclear weapons, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a level playing field, enabling small States to thrive. May we be always mindful and proactive so as to ensure that no country is left behind in the pursuit and achievement of the 2030 Agenda.\nIt is our shared responsibility to create the best opportunities and fulfil the expectations of our current and future generations. I am convinced that if we continue to work steadfastly, while always remaining vigilant and focused on the overarching goals, we will contribute to a more relevant, fair, productive and meaningful United Nations and, by extension, a better world for all our peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "It is  an  honour  for  Vanuatu  to  join  other  speakers  in congratulating you, Madam President, on your accession to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, and we assure you of our full support. I would also like to express my gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his excellent leadership. Allow me also to commend Secretary-General Guterres and reiterate to him my Government\u2019s confidence in his ability to carry out his functions as chief administrator.\nI also want to pay tribute to His Excellency the late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who passed away last month. Mr. Annan will long be remembered for his advocacy for United Nations reform and his commitment to resolving major issues peacefully, given his faith in mediation and dialogue.\nThe United Nations was founded on the vision that nations can together play an important preventive role in saving successive generations from the scourge of war and restoring confidence in basic human rights. The founders also envisioned an organization that would be a pillar of the world order, in which international peace and security would be guaranteed by international law. Moreover, they envisaged international mechanisms for strengthening social progress and the living conditions of humankind. During these weeks of debate we have an opportunity to assess the progress that has been made over the past seven decades and to discuss areas in which we must do more. The theme of the seventy- third session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, is more fitting than ever as we deliberate on ways to build a stronger, fairer and more transparent United Nations that meets its goals.\nThe United Nations has made great strides in the past few decades. Extreme poverty has been halved. More girls are enrolled in school than ever before. More women, especially in rural areas, are playing roles with increased responsibility and contributing to the global economy. Similarly, the health of mothers and children has improved significantly. However, those advances are overshadowed by gaps in the Organization, including its continued inability to address the growing list of problems facing humankind, including preventing\n \ncrises. The Security Council\u2019s inability to take decisive action on the Syrian issue is one of many examples. The Government of Vanuatu joins other Governments in recalling that membership in the Security Council is not only a mark of prestige but also entails knowing how to demonstrate strong leadership and assume shared responsibilities to safeguard peace and security in the world.\nMy Government welcomes the reforms that Secretary-General Guterres is undertaking, prioritizing prevention and the maintenance of peace while making the Organization more coherent and effective through a comprehensive approach. We welcome the efforts to reform the United Nations development system, which require specific changes within the system in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. My Government asks that the United Nations system be flexible and provide opportunities to review and adapt the configuration, role and development services of the many United Nations country teams so as to ensure the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. With reference to an important part of the United Nations reform agenda under way, I would like to draw attention to the pillar of human rights. Without an effective and resilient United Nations-led human rights system within every State, it will be difficult to employ preventive diplomacy. United Nations reform should consider the entire system by aligning peace and security more closely with the pillars of development and human rights.\nThe Pacific region is committed to strengthening climate resilience as quickly as possible so as to build a strong region. That emerged from the Pacific Islands Forum leaders summit held in Nauru earlier this month. Nature continues to warn us of the imminent dangers to our planet as it approaches a point of no return beyond which our climate systems will no longer be able to cope. Summer heatwaves, huge forest fires, extreme drought and the increasing frequency and scale of weather events have brought the debate on global warming to an indisputable level of importance. I sincerely hope that those warnings will provoke concerted climate action.\nAs the world\u2019s most at-risk country in terms of exposure to natural hazards, according to the World Risk Index of the United Nations University, for Vanuatu climate change continues to be the biggest threat to attaining the national targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and it is currently our worst problem, putting the lives of tens of thousands at risk. If\nthe level of greenhouse-gas emissions continues to rise relentlessly, we will witness an escalation of the costs associated with the effects of climate change, costs that vulnerable countries such as Vanuatu cannot afford. That will cost us dearly in the future if the international community does not act now.\nThe Governments of  industrialized  countries have pledged $100 billion annually by 2020 to finance climate-change mitigation measures in vulnerable countries. But how to attain that goal remains unclear. We call for prioritizing those commitments and putting in place a specific road map for mobilizing and accumulating the promised funds as soon as possible, because climate change is upon us. We also call for more flexible access to climate funding by simplifying validation procedures, so that vulnerable countries can take action and repair the damage caused by climate change.\nThe Pacific region cannot afford to see the Paris Agreement on Climate Change relegated to the archives of the United Nations. We therefore call for the Paris Agreement\u2019s work programme to be completed and made operational at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland. Climate change threatens the sustainability of the environment, sustainable development and people\u2019s inalienable  rights,  both now and in the future. It represents a real danger to the survival of future generations and to low-lying countries in the Pacific. The current pledges being made through nationally determined contributions are simply not enough to reverse climate change. The parties to the Paris Agreement must intensify their ambitions to reach the agreed target limit of no more than 1.5\u00b0 C. For vulnerable countries, especially in our region, a failure to do so would mean even greater exposure to more frequent natural disasters.\nAs the largest oceanic continent in the world, the Pacific islands region is a vital source of food and income for our population. It is therefore important to implement sustainable policies for the sound management and conservation of the oceans that can ensure a future for our peoples. We welcome opportunities to support our regional efforts to protect our oceans. Vanuatu, like other countries, has unresolved issues regarding the delimitation of its maritime boundaries, which is a very\n \nimportant step in our independence process, and we are determined to resolve those issues. We are committed to and are encouraged by the decision of the Pacific leaders, under the auspices of the Pacific Islands Forum, to bring the negotiations forward with a view to finishing and reporting in 2019.\nVanuatu welcomes the mobilization of the Pacific Islands Forum to establish a new implementation agreement on the conservation  and  sustainable  use of biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, which represents an important opportunity for the Pacific region.\nVanuatu maintains its position on denuclearization. Pacific island countries, including our brothers and sisters in the Federated States of Micronesia, continue to be exposed to ongoing threats from radioactive contaminants, including remnants from the Second World War and unexploded ordnance. We therefore call on Member States to join us in ratifying the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nSince the inception of the United Nations, some 750 million people from more than 80 former colonies have gained political independence. However, the situation still remains desperate for millions of others aspiring to achieve self-determination. Vanuatu attaches great importance to the work of the Special Committee on Decolonization. The elimination of all forms of colonialism must remain a top priority on the United Nations agenda, in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. New Caledonia is on a path to deciding its political destiny through a referendum to be held on 4 November. We appeal to the international community to support the right of the people of New Caledonia to fully participate in that referendum and, above all, to ensure that it takes place in a free and fair manner.\nThe international community is witnessing violence and human rights abuses against West Papua nationals. We urge the Human Rights Council to investigate those abuses. We also call on our leading counterparts around the world to pay more attention to those  inhumane acts and, together with Indonesia, to stop all forms of violence and find common ground with nationalists so as to facilitate the establishment of a process that will allow them to freely express their choice.\nAccording to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, we all have an obligation to work together to lift the economic, trade and financial embargoes imposed on the Republic of Cuba, and\nlifting those bans will, among other things, allow the Cuban people to benefit and enjoy their human rights.\nMy Government\u2019s top priority is to ensure national sustainable development for our population by 2030, and we aim to leave no one behind. Our national sustainable development goals are people-oriented, transformative and indivisible in order to strike a balance to the three dimensions of sustainable development. We recognize that the eradication of poverty in all its forms and aspects is an essential condition for sustainable development.\nHowever, my Government cannot bear the immense responsibility of achieving sustainable development in our country alone, a responsibility that is all the more difficult given that we are exposed to increasingly fierce natural disasters. Most recently, my Government had to evacuate some 11,000 people from Ambae Island owing to increased volcanic activity. That poses a financial challenge in the context of an already limited national budget. In that regard, I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the development partners who have assisted the Government and the people of Vanuatu in these difficult times and are helping to fund activities that improve the living conditions of our people.\nMy Government welcomes the opportunity to present Vanuatu\u2019s national voluntary review in 2019, and we count on the support and comments of delegations as we share our progress, shortcomings and challenges. In implementing Vanuatu\u2019s sustainable development plan, we believe it is essential to create sincere and sustainable partnerships across all sectors and with multiple stakeholders.  Vanuatu  will  emerge  from its status as a least-developed country by December 2020. We hope to be able to count on our development partners to assist us with support measures that will enable us to attain developed country status with improved conditions.\nI would like to conclude by reiterating that Vanuatu believes and trusts in multilateralism. The United Nations has made this world a better place compared to what it was 70 years ago. While much progress has been made since then, there is still much work ahead of us if we want to maintain the relevance of the United Nations. International problems require appropriate solutions. We need to find ways to act collectively and inclusively in order to solve those problems. We must continually strive to reform the Organization in order to make it more effective so that it meets our expectations today and in the years to come.\n"

        "file_text": "When I spoke here three years ago (see A/70/PV.22), Israel stood alone among the nations. Of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this Hall, only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran. We opposed it because it threatens our future, even our very survival. We opposed it because the deal paved Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear arsenal. By lifting the sanctions, it has fuelled Iran\u2019s campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the Middle East. We opposed it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie, that Iran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons.\nIsrael exposed that lie earlier this year. In February 2018, Israel conducted a daring raid on Iran\u2019s secret atomic archive. We obtained more than 100,000 documents and videos that had been stashed in vaults in an innocent-looking building in the heart of Tehran. In May, I presented a short summary of what we obtained to the international media. I provided hard evidence of Iran\u2019s plans to build nuclear weapons and its plans to deceive the international community. Israel shared that information and even more damning evidence that we found with members of the five plus one group and with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nMonths have passed, and the IAEA has still not taken any action. It has not posed a single question to Iran. It has not demanded to inspect a single new site discovered in that secret archive. Given that inaction,  I have decided, therefore, to reveal today something else that we have shared with the IAEA and with a few intelligence agencies. What I am about to say has not been shared publicly before. Today I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran\u2019s secret nuclear-weapon programme.\nIn May, we exposed the site of Iran\u2019s secret atomic archive. It is in the Shorabad district of Tehran. Today I am revealing the site of a second facility, Iran\u2019s secret atomic warehouse, which is located in the Torquzabad district of Tehran, just three miles away from the archive. Let me show exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like. From this image, it looks just like the atomic archive, another innocent-looking compound. For listeners at home using Google Earth, this no-longer-secret atomic warehouse is on Mehr Alley. The coordinates are on the image. Anyone can try to get there. And for those who try to get there, it  is a hundred meters from the Kalishoi, a rug-cleaning operation. By the way, I hear they do a fantastic job of cleaning rugs there. But by now they may be radioactive rags. That is the second secret site.\nNow countries with satellite capabilities may notice some increased activity on Mehr Alley in the days and weeks ahead. The people they will see scurrying back and forth are Iranian officials desperately trying to finish the job of cleaning up that site. Since we raided the atomic archive, they have been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. Just last month, they removed 15 kilogrammes of radioactive materiel. What did they do with it? They had to get those 15 kilogrammes of radioactive materiel out of the site, so they took it out and spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence. The residents of Tehran, now endangered, may want to know that they can get a Geiger counter on Amazon for only $29.99. At today\u2019s exchange rate, that is just 4 million Iranian rials. But we will get to that later. I will talk about the Iranian economy in a minute.\nThey took that radioactive material and spread it around Tehran. The Iranian officials cleaning out the site still have a lot of work to do, because they had at least 15 gigantic ship containers full of nuclear-related equipment  and  materiel  stored  there.  Since  each of\n \nthose containers can hold 20 tons of materiel, the site must have contained as much as 300 tons of nuclear- related equipment and materiel, all in that very place.\nWe now have to ask ourselves a question. Why did Iran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic warehouse? After all, when South Africa and Libya gave up their nuclear programmes, the first thing they did was to destroy both the archives and the materiel and equipment. The answer to the question is simple. The reason Iran did not destroy its atomic archive and its atomic warehouse is because it has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons. In fact, it planned to use both of those sites in a few years when the time was right to break out the atom bomb. Delegations may rest assured that that will not happen. It will not happen because what Iran hides Israel will find.\nI have a message for  the  Head  of  the  IAEA,  Mr. Yukiya Amano. I believe he is a good man. I believe he wants to do the right thing. I therefore ask him to do the right thing now. The IAEA should inspect that atomic warehouse immediately, before the Iranians finish clearing it out. Do delegations remember the time when we were promised that inspections could take place anytime, anywhere? Well, how about inspections of Mehr Alley right now? And while Mr. Amano is at it, he should inspect the other sites that we told him about. Once and for all, he should tell the world the truth about Iran.\nI also have a message today for the tyrants of Tehran. Israel knows what they are doing, and Israel knows where they are doing it. Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction develop nuclear weapons \u2014 not now, not in 10 years, not ever. And Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran\u2019s aggression. We will continue to act against it in Syria. We will act against it in Lebanon. We will act against it in Iraq. We will act against it whenever and wherever we must. We must act to defend our State and to defend our people.\nThree years ago, a few weeks after the nuclear deal was completed, I asked this question from this very podium: does anyone seriously believe that flooding Iran\u2019s radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression? But many of the deal\u2019s supporters believed just that. They believed that Iran\u2019s regime would become more moderate, more peaceful. They believed that Iran would use the billions of dollars it received in sanctions relief to improve the lives of\nits people \u2014 solving the water problem, the trucking problem, the electricity problem and improving hospitals and schools. That is what they believed. Perhaps some people here today also believed that.\nWell, it did not happen. Instead, Iran used the money to fuel its vast war machine. Just this past year, Iran has attacked Kurds in Iraq, slaughtered Sunnis in Syria, armed Hizbullah in Lebanon, financed Hamas in Gaza, fired missiles into Saudi Arabia and threatened the freedom of navigation in the Strait  of  Hormuz and the Strait of Bab El-Mandeb. That is some peace, some moderation.\nIf people think that Iran\u2019s aggression has been confined to the Middle East, they need to  think again. Last month, two Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks here in the United States, and several weeks ago, Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks in the heart of Europe. Yet while the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions, Europe and others are appeasing Iran by trying to help it bypass those new sanctions.\nNow, I have just used a tough word,  a  very  strong word: appeasement. I use it reluctantly. But unfortunately that is exactly what we are seeing again in Europe. We need to think about that. The same week that Iran was caught red-handed trying to murder European citizens, European leaders were rolling out the red carpet for President Rouhani, promising to give Iran even more money. As the son of a historian, I have to ask \u2014 and I ask it not merely as a historian\u2019s son, but as a Jew, a citizen of the world and someone who has lived through the twentieth century \u2014 have these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?\nWe in Israel do not need a wake-up call, because Iran threatens us every day. Despite the  best  of  hopes \u2014 and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal \u2014 that deal did not push war further away. It brought it ever closer to our borders. In Syria, Iran  is trying to establish permanent military bases against us and has already launched missiles and drones into our territory. In Gaza, Iran is arming terror groups to launch rocket attacks on our cities and terror attacks on our civilians. In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hizbullah in the building of secret sites for converting inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles that can hit targets deep inside Israel with an accuracy of within 10 metres.\n \nThe Assembly needs to listen to this. Hizbullah is deliberately using the innocent people of Beirut as human shields. It has placed three of these missile-conversion sites alongside Beirut\u2019s international airport. I can show a picture that is worth a thousand missiles. In it, we can see Beirut\u2019s international airport, the first missile site, which is in the Ouzai neighbourhood, on the water\u2019s edge, a few blocks away from the runway. There is also a second site, which is underneath a soccer stadium, two blocks away, and a third site, which is adjacent to the airport itself, right next to it.\nI therefore have a message for Hizbullah today. Israel also knows what it is doing. Israel knows where it is doing it. And Israel will not let it get away with it. Just as supporters of the nuclear deal were wrong about what would happen when sanctions were removed, they were dead wrong about what would happen when sanctions were restored. They argued that United States sanctions alone would have little economic impact on Iran. That is what they said. It is hard to believe.\nLet us take a look at what  has  happened  to  Iran\u2019s economy now that President Trump has forced companies to choose between doing business with Iran and doing business with the United States, whose gross domestic product is 50 times the size of Iran\u2019s gross domestic product. A year ago, Iran\u2019s economy was booming. Now it is collapsing. Iran\u2019s currency is plummeting. Inflation and unemployment are soaring. British airlines, German banks, French oil companies, Japanese oil importers and many others are scrambling to get out. If that is little economic impact, we can imagine what will happen with the next batch of United States sanctions, which will be imposed in November.\nThe deal\u2019s supporters were also wrong when they argued \u2014 and it is hard to believe that they argued this, despite the fact that I have had many arguments with them \u2014 that restoring sanctions would rally the Iranian people around the regime. While they are definitely rallying, their rallying is definitely not around the regime. They are rallying against the regime. They are not chanting \u201cDeath to America\u201d. They are chanting \u201cDeath to the dictator\u201d. They are not chanting \u201cExport the Islamic Revolution\u201d. They are chanting \u201cLeave Syria\u201d, \u201cLeave Lebanon\u201d, \u201cLeave Gaza\u201d, and \u201cTake care of us in Iran\u201d.\nI listen to those protests. I talk to Iranian people. I show videos and get so many responses \u2014 from Iranians. At first, I thought they were Iranian exiles \u2014 in the\nsafety of London or Paris or Los Angeles. No, these are Iranians from Iran, embracing Israel, criticizing their regime \u2014 that is an understatement \u2014 with their names. Shortly after the protests broke out, I asked my intelligence people, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d\nThose protests are an indicator of something extraordinary that has been taking  place there. Through those protests, the Iranian people are showing unbelievable courage. The protests are now embracing the whole of Iran \u2014 from the urban centres to distant villages, from the striking merchants in the bazaars to the young women  uncovering their hair.  The people of Iran are bravely standing up to a regime that has brutally repressed them for four decades and that has squandered \u2014 and still squanders \u2014 their money in bloody wars across the Middle East.\nThis is what I say to Europe\u2019s leaders and to others. Instead of coddling Iran\u2019s dictators, join the United States and Israel and most of  the Arab world  in supporting new sanctions against a regime that endangers all of us across the world.\nIsrael is deeply grateful to President Trump for his bold decision to withdraw from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. A great many of our Arab neighbours are also grateful. And everyone who cares about the peace and security of the world should also be grateful.\nBut I have an important confession to make. It  may be surprising, but I have to admit that the Iran deal has had one positive consequence, an unintended but positive consequence. By empowering Iran, it has brought Israel and many Arab States closer than they have ever been before, in an intimacy and friendship that I have not seen in my lifetime and that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.\nWhen friendships are formed around a threat or a challenge, opportunities are quickly seen, not just for security but for how to bring a better life to our peoples, which is what Israel can and wants to contribute to. Israel deeply values those new friendships, and I hope the day will soon arrive when Israel will be able to expand peace, a formal peace, beyond Egypt and Jordan to other Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians. I look forward to working with President Trump and his peace team to achieve that goal.\nI also want to take the opportunity now, here at the United Nations, a place I know something about because many years ago I served here as Ambassador\n \nfor many years, to express Israel\u2019s appreciation to President Trump and Ambassador Haley for the unwavering support they have provided to Israel at  the United Nations. They have unequivocally backed Israel\u2019s right to defend itself.  They rightly pulled out of a history-denying UNESCO and a morally bankrupt Human Rights Council. I think that more resolutions about Israel than about the rest of the world combined have been introduced in those bodies, and tenfold the number of resolutions on Iran, Syria or any other State. It is not even fair to say \u201ctenfold\u201d, because there are no multiples of zero.\nPresident Trump and Ambassador Haley also stopped funding an unreformed United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, an organization that perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it. Day after day, the Trump Administration has stood up to what has long been a specialty here at the United Nations, slandering Israel. Even though the shameful resolution 3379\n(XXX) comparing Zionism to racism was repealed 25 years ago, I am sorry to say that its foul stench still clings to these halls.\nIsrael airlifted Ethiopian Jews to freedom and a new life in Israel, in the Jewish State. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is absurdly accused of racism. Israel\u2019s Arab citizens vote in our elections, serve in our Parliament, preside over our courts and have exactly the same individual rights as all other Israeli citizens. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is shamefully accused of apartheid. Today there are at least five times as many Palestinians as there were in 1948, the year of Israel\u2019s founding. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing. Do those here know what that is? It is the same old anti-Semitism with a brand-new face. That is all it is.\nOnce it was the Jewish people who were slandered and held to a different standard; today it is the Jewish State that is slandered and held to a different standard. Here is an example. Take the outlandish attacks that have been levelled against Israel after our Knesset, our Parliament, recently adopted a law declaring Israel the nation-State of the Jewish people. Nevertheless, Israel is a free country. People can oppose that law, and people have done so. People can call for different wording in this or that clause, or add or delete a clause. People can do that.\nBut when Israel is called racist for making  Hebrew its official language and the Star of  David  its national flag, when Israel is labelled an apartheid State for declaring itself the nation-State of the Jewish people \u2014 that is downright preposterous. And does the Assembly know why? Because represented in the Hall today are more than 100 countries that have only one official language, even though many other languages are commonly spoken within those countries. There are more than 50 countries here that have crosses or crescents on their flags, even though they have many non-Muslims and non-Christians living in  their  midst. And there are dozens of countries that define themselves as nation-States of a particular people, even though there are many ethnic and national minorities within their borders. None of those countries have been denigrated or libelled for celebrating their unique national identity. Only Israel is denigrated. Only Israel is libelled. What is unique about the Jewish people is not that we have a nation-State. What is unique is that many still oppose our having a nation-State.\nMoments ago, President Abbas outrageously said that Israel\u2019s nation-State law proves that Israel is a racist, apartheid State. President Abbas should know better. He wrote a dissertation denying the Holocaust. His Palestinian National Authority imposes death sentences on Palestinians for selling land to Jews. Let me repeat that. If a Jew buys an apartment or a piece of land anywhere in the Palestinian territories, the Palestinian who sold  him that land is executed. That  is what the law says. President Abbas proudly pays Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews. In fact, the more they slay, the more he pays. That is in their law too. Then how can he condemn Israel\u2019s morality and call Israel racist?\nThat is not the way to peace. That is not the way  to achieve the peace that we all want and need and to which Israel remains committed. This body should not be applauding the Head of a regime that pays terrorists. The United Nations should condemn such a despicable policy. And the United Nations, which brokered an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire in 2014, should demand that Hamas release our fallen soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin. The latter was kidnapped when Hamas violated that very ceasefire. Hamas should also release the two Israeli citizens whom it holds captive, Avera Mengistu and Hisham Al-Sayed.\nEvery time I stand here I  feel  as  I  do  today.  I am privileged to stand here as the Prime Minister\n \nof the State of Israel, a Jewish and democratic State. Some believe that Israel cannot be both Jewish and democratic. That is false. Israel is both, and Israel will always remain both. Ever since Abraham and Sarah made their journey to the promised land, nearly 4,000 years ago, the land of  Israel has been our homeland. It is the place where Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob, Leah and Rachel carried out their eternal covenant with God. It is where Joshua made us a sovereign nation, where David ruled and Isaiah preached, where the Maccabees fought and where Masada fell. It is the place from which we were exiled and to which we returned, rebuilding our ancient and eternal capital, Jerusalem. The nation-State of Israel is the only place where the Jewish people proudly exercise our collective right of self-determination. That right was recognized nearly a century ago by the League of Nations, and more than 70 years ago by the United Nations when it supported the establishment of a Jewish State. That is what resolution 181 (II) said, \u201ca Jewish State\u201d.\nAt the same time, Israel is a vibrant democracy, where all its citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, enjoy equal individual rights, and those rights are guaranteed by law. In Israel, whether a person is a Jew or an  Arab, a Christian or a Muslim, a Druze or a Bedouin or anything else, that person\u2019s individual rights are exactly the same and will always  remain the same.  In the Middle East that is not obvious. Now that is an understatement. In the Middle East, where women are often treated as property, minorities are persecuted and gays are hanged, Israel stands out as a shining example of freedom and progress.\nI could not be more proud to represent my country, Israel. I am proud that we have made Israel a global technological Power of breathtaking creativity in information technology and precision agriculture. Is the Assembly aware that we target the fertilizer and the water down to the individual plant \u2014 not to a field,  not to part of a field, but down to the plant? I am proud of those geniuses that have brought those unbelievable developments in water management, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, digital health, medical devices and so many other fields that are improving the lives of billions of people around the world. I am proud of Israel\u2019s brilliant scholars, innovative entrepreneurs, talented artists, devoted teachers and compassionate doctors, and of our search-and-rescue teams who save lives from Haiti to Mexico, from Nepal to the Philippines. I am also proud of Israel\u2019s courageous soldiers, the men\nand women who bravely defend our homeland while upholding the highest values. Most of all, I am proud of the people of Israel, who draw extraordinary strength from the deep wellsprings of our heritage, who possess an unbreakable spirit and who are as determined as ever to build a secure and magnificent future for the one and only Jewish State."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour to address the General Assembly in my native tongue, Georgian, one of the most ancient languages of world civilization and an integral part of it.\nToday is 27 September, an extremely troubling and painful date in my country\u2019s history. Twenty-five years ago today, the occupation of a historical part of Georgia started, turning into an extremely severe challenge for Georgia\u2019s newly established statehood. Ten years ago, the Russian Federation launched yet another large-scale military aggression against my country, which resulted in the full-scale occupation of Georgia\u2019s two historic and integral regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali.\nTen years after that military aggression, our territories remain occupied. As a result of ethnic cleansing, 10 per cent of our population is still forcefully displaced, while the rights of hundreds of thousands  of  our citizens are being disregarded. The situation   in Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali regions is dire and alarming. The situation in the occupied territories is a humanitarian disaster of the worst kind. The growing militarization of those regions is in full swing, and depopulation is increasing by the minute. Because of the grave humanitarian, socioeconomic and human rights situation, the population in the occupied regions has dropped by a factor of four or five since the occupation began. Razor wire and other artificial barriers split families and violate fundamental human rights. Those who live along the occupation lines are even prevented from visiting houses of prayer and the graves of their ancestors. Our citizens are forbidden to educate their children in their native language. Abductions, torture and murder continue. Archil Tatunashvili, Giga Otkhozoria and 18-year-old Davit Basharuli are recent victims of such atrocities. Because of those and many other cruel offences, the Otkhozoria-Tatunashvili list\nwas created in order to record the names of those who have committed such egregious crimes. We believe that those on the list must be held accountable through applicable international law.\nThe occupation and blatant disregard of the rule of law has created serious challenges to the stability and security of Georgia and the wider region. Owing to the existing conflicts in the South Caucasus, even a minor incident may escalate into uncontainable unrest with subsequent serious consequences. The international community\u2019s firm support for the peaceful resolution of the Russia-Georgia conflict is critically important. The international community must  stand  together and strong in support of the principle of the sovereign equality of States and the inviolability of their internationally recognized borders, because only by observing the fundamental norms of international law and protecting human rights can we ensure peace and security throughout the world.\nRussia has yet to fulfil its international obligations and respect the 2008 ceasefire agreement reached through the mediation of the European Union (EU). We, on the other hand, have fulfilled that agreement down to the smallest detail and have assumed the legally binding obligation not to use force. That affirms our irreversible policy of seeking an exclusively peaceful resolution of the conflict. I therefore urge the Russian Federation to fulfil the international obligations that  it has signed and withdraw its occupation forces from Georgia\u2019s territory.\nWe are actively trying to use the format of the Geneva international discussions,  but  our  attempts at the negotiation table have met with unfounded and absolutely unacceptable resistance from Russia. I would like to reiterate that we attach special importance to the role of the United Nations in the Geneva talks, which the United Nations co-chairs along with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the EU.\nIn the twenty-first century, as people, nations and cultures strive for greater integration and development, the installation of artificial barriers and barbed wire are absolutely unacceptable. We want to break the deadlock in the relations between Russia and Georgia, but that can be accomplished only through respect for Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty and the principles of international law. Despite the injustice that we have suffered, our only response to these challenges has been to continue our quest for peace and Georgia\u2019s\n \ndevelopment. We have proposed a new peace initiative designed to overcome the humanitarian disaster in the occupied territories and create new opportunities for our citizens there. With that initiative, we are fighting to stop the process of depopulation in the occupied territories and ensure respect for people\u2019s fundamental human rights. We call that initiative \u201cA Step to a Better Future\u201d, and it seeks precisely to provide the populations in the occupied territories with access to health care and educational services and to create opportunities for income-generating activities for them so that they can feed their families and ensure their physical survival.\nToday, from this rostrum, I would like to address our Abkhaz and Ossetian compatriots. Georgia\u2019s every success is their success. We share a common historical past, which must pave the way for our future, which I am convinced will bring us peace and prosperity. It is the Georgian authorities\u2019 duty to protect and guarantee the rights of every citizen, and we are irreversibly committed to fulfilling that duty. They should enjoy all the benefits put in place by Georgia, whether regarding human rights, education, health care or visa-free travel to Europe. I would particularly like to address young people there. Together, through joint efforts and pursuing opportunities, we can achieve success and prosperity. I want the youth to know that it is only in unity with them that we see our future. And I would once again like to urge Russia not to undermine or compromise our peace initiatives and to make it possible for the citizens in the occupied territories to lead a decent life.\nWith its rich culture and ancient history, Georgia has always stood with the world\u2019s civilized nations and contributed to the development of European and global civilizations. Accordingly, we remain engaged in the fight against the challenges facing humankind. Today, unfortunately, that list is quite long. It includes conflicts, terrorism, migration and forced displacement, climate change, poverty and grave human rights violations. Addressing those issues requires enormous efforts and strong political will on the part of the United Nations and each Member State. Each and every one of us must confront those challenges in order to make the world   a better place. We strongly believe that the pursuit of national interests in the modern world should be based on mutual respect and should in no way be  carried out at  the expense of  others. It  is  in that context that I would like to echo the theme of this year\u2019s  session  of the General Assembly and reaffirm that we are committed to making our contribution to our shared\ngoal of peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, and to strengthening the role of the United Nations by helping it to make progress in achieving its goals.\nIn establishing a democratic republic, a century ago, Georgia made its civilizational choice to define the future of our nation. We belong in the common European family. That choice remains unchanged and is yet another strong argument confirming our European identity. Georgia, with its values and contributions, has always been an organic part of Europe, as shown by its successful cooperation with the EU.\nWhen Georgia declared independence, a century ago, its Constitution was built on the very values and principles that remain relevant and progressive even today. Suffice it to say that a century ago the multiparty Georgian Parliament included five women, an achievement rarely found even among the established democracies of that time. This year my country is celebrating the 100th anniversary of that event, the declaration of our democratic republic. Georgia regained its independence 27 years ago and embarked on a path to building a modern democratic State. It may not seem like a long time in historical terms, but our young democracy has faced numerous trials and tribulations over that period. Today\u2019s Georgia is the heir and successor to the values enshrined a century ago.\nGeorgia\u2019s progress in recent years in terms of democratic consolidation, respect for human rights and strengthening the rule of law is the unequivocal result of its fundamental reforms. Our strong Parliament, non-partisan President, independent judiciary and effective Government are the outcome of our successful constitutional reform, and the country is therefore switching to a European parliamentary model of governance. For us, the country\u2019s development fully focuses on free human beings and on human capital created by those free human beings. Our ambitious education reforms and modernization of the education system will be yet another breakthrough on the  path to overcoming the challenges that we face today. Only educated, motivated, confident young people can bring about progress, eliminate poverty and ensure that Georgia joins the developed and innovative economies. A small, flexible and effective Government is counterbalanced by strong public and institutional mechanisms of control and civil society, which perfectly reflects our commitments under Sustainable Development Goal 16.\n \nGeorgia\u2019s election last year as Chair of the Open Government Partnership was a recognition of our country\u2019s achievements, bearing witness to the effectiveness of the efforts that have brought our society concrete results. Protecting fundamental human rights and dignity is our top priority. In that regard, Georgia has emerged as the region\u2019s leading reformer in recent years. Especially noteworthy is the fact that we have overcome a major challenge in the penitentiary system that we inherited. Most notably, we have made visible progress with regard to the respect for human rights  in prisons. We have implemented important judicial reforms, which we intend to continue by launching the next wave of reforms. One of the main achievements of our political action has been to establish media freedom and media pluralism. In 2018, Georgia further improved its position in the World Press Freedom Index, and we have exceptional achievements in the area of Internet freedom.\nCivil society plays a definitive role in the process of building democracy. Without  a  strong  civil society, especially in a young democracy, a country\u2019s harmonious development is unimaginable. We want an independent, strong, and active civil society to develop in our country. Under our sustainable development policy, we have prioritized green policies and a green economy. At the same time, we are developing  a digital economy poised to advance the country to a qualitatively new level. Our economic strategy relies on inclusive economic development and economic growth, which are being reflected in the well-being of each citizen. We have been successfully implementing that strategy, aimed at transforming Georgia into the region\u2019s economic, tourism, logistics and educational hub, as evidenced by our leading positions in reputable international rankings.\nOur country\u2019s unique geography and strategic location between Europe and Asia have positioned Georgia for centuries as an attractive meeting place for civilizations and cultural dialogue. We continue to fulfil that function, and we are implementing ambitious and crucial new projects to that end.  A  few  years ago, we addressed the world from this rostrum and offered to host the Silk Road Forum in Georgia. We have not only made the Forum a reality but have also reclaimed Georgia\u2019s historical role in the wider Silk Road region. Today, however, I would like to propose a new initiative and offer to facilitate the Tbilisi Forum, focusing on transforming the Black Sea region and the\nCaucasus, which are currently areas of confrontation and challenges, into a space for peace, cooperation, and development.\nGeorgia\u2019s every achievement, its democratic and economic development and leading regional position in various areas are the result specifically of our European and Euro-Atlantic choice, which is enshrined in the Constitution and the relevant parliamentary resolutions. NATO-Georgia relations have become very dynamic and comprehensive. Georgia is a NATO-aspirant country and an enhanced opportunities partner, as well as the largest per capita contributor of troops to the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan, thereby contributing to the architecture of global security.\nEveryone here is aware of the disturbing threat posed by transnational terrorism, which is much larger and more overwhelming today than ever before. Terrorism is the twenty-first century\u2019s common enemy. In the fight against that shared threat, Georgia has always stood, and will continue to stand, shoulder to shoulder with the international community. Unfortunately, many valiant Georgian soldiers have fallen in the global fight. We all agree that combating terrorism, along with preventing and responding adequately to that scourge, is possible only through joint efforts and shared responsibilities. I am convinced that we will defeat it.\nGeorgia\u2019s pain is not a problem facing one country alone. In 2008, the world perceived the aggression against Georgia as a problem in the relations between just two countries. The way things continued to unfold, however, showed that at the time the  world was unprepared to adequately assess and respond to that aggression. Unfortunately, the United Nations proved ineffective in the face of that challenge. Today, the global security system is eroding before our very eyes. Today\u2019s world needs a stronger United Nations, and the international community needs institutions capable of properly evaluating and responding to today\u2019s challenges and preventing the risks that are undermining global security.\nAs Members know, the debates on reforming the United Nations began in the 1990s, although we must admit that we cannot see any serious success in that direction so far. That is why the issue of  reforming  the United Nations remains relevant, and  I  believe that it requires immediate action. As the world faces the challenges of a  new  era  with  problems  yet  to  be identified, we all have the task of reacting to and\n \njointly overcoming global challenges in order to ensure a peaceful and better world for future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "All praise is due to the Almighty Allah for granting us the favour of gathering in the Assembly once again to discuss and advance our common global agenda. Please allow me to begin by sincerely thanking His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for the excellent manner in which he presided over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. By the same token, I congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at  its seventy-third session.  I assure her that as one of her Vice-Presidents, the Gambia pledges its full support and cooperation during her tenure of office.\nThe theme of the seventy-third session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d, is indeed very relevant to today\u2019s global affairs. By implication, the pursuit of the mission of the United Nations for peace, development and human rights also remains as relevant today as it was in 1945, when it was adopted in response to the horrific experiences and destruction during that tragic era. Amid the complex multilateral challenges that continue to confront us globally, no country can thrive or solve all of the challenges it faces in isolation. As human beings, our salvation lies in strengthening our multilateral institutions and fostering greater\ninternational cooperation in order to collectively address global challenges. The United Nations provides a unique opportunity to achieve that goal.\nIt is apparent that in order to make real progress, effective global leadership is imperative. As leaders, we must therefore all shoulder our responsibilities as best we can. That should compel us to support and invest more in the United Nations, instead of withdrawing our participation or cutting back our financial support. It is ironic that at a time when multiple global challenges are emerging and mounting, support for the work of the United Nations is being undermined through inadequate funding. Those of us who value the United Nations, as well as those who have benefited immensely from its work, should be at the forefront in calling on all Member States to step up support for the Organization. Indeed, the United Nations must play a lead role in solving global challenges, and our task is to ensure that it has the required capacity, influence and effectiveness.\nDecisions and actions rooted in a rules-based international system that is underpinned by multilateral agreements and processes form the basis for the successful conduct of relations between and among nations. Let us therefore restore faith in our rules- based international order, so as to  remain  relevant and collectively make progress on our global agenda, ranging from tackling the menaces of climate change and terrorism to addressing disarmament, trade, development and other issues of concern to humankind. I am confident that it is only through effective global leadership and international cooperation that the well- being of all of the world\u2019s citizens can be achieved. As leaders, we have  the shared responsibility to promote a world order that prioritizes peace over insecurity, eliminates the growing inequalities around the world and brings us sustainable development.\nWith reference to the Gambia and following a difficult political impasse in December 2016, Gambians have managed, with the support of our partners, to restore democracy and the rule of law in our country. We have completed our national electoral process in full, after successfully conducting both legislative and local Government elections. We are also resolutely pursuing institutional and constitutional reforms. Such reforms have commenced, with the hope of putting the Gambia on a solid path to becoming a shining champion of democracy and human rights in the world.\n \nWhen Gambians voted for change in 2016, they were yearning to be in charge of their destiny. They wanted significant, not cosmetic, improvements in their lives. It is for  that reason that my  Government  is now implementing a comprehensive national development plan for the period 2018-2021. The plan seeks to transform the Gambia through key priorities, such as infrastructure development, agricultural transformation, macroeconomic stability, job creation and employment. The plan also seeks to consolidate our democratic gains through good governance, the rule of law and respect for human and people\u2019s rights. In all, our goal is to deliver a fully transformed Gambia that has a future, a country that is energy secure, food-self- sufficient and investment-friendly. We have also begun to exploit and harness the  benefits  of  information and communication technology as a catalyst for modernization and youth empowerment.\nOur  national  development  plan  was presented to a successful donor conference in Brussels, where significant pledges were made to help us meet our funding targets. I want to once again express our profound thanks to our bilateral and multilateral partners, including the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank and many others, for their interest and support. We  are  indeed  truly  grateful, as we look forward to their continued collaboration and support for our efforts to attain our development objectives. The national development plan will continue to be implemented through the partnerships and solidarity built at the Brussels meeting. Quite deliberately, the plan is consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063.\nIn our pursuit of a fully transformed Gambia, we recognize the importance of meaningful engagement with the Gambian diaspora, fondly referred to as the eighth region of the Gambia. Our diaspora strategy seeks to explore and utilize the skills, talents and resources of Gambians everywhere for the successful implementation of our national development plan.\nThe Gambia\u2019s experience demonstrates that democracy yields amazing dividends. Remarkably, we have noticed a decrease in the number of young people attempting to undertake dangerous journeys  across the Mediterranean to Europe. The average Gambian is willing to stay in the country and contribute to national development. Despite those positive developments, I strongly urge that interventions to curb youth migration\nbe supported through incentives to young people to stay in their country. In that regard, we look forward to the high-level conference in Marrakech in December aimed at adopting the new global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration. Better educational and job opportunities must be harnessed for young people in order to inspire them and give  them hope  in life.  In that regard, my Government stands ready to work collaboratively with the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States and other regional blocs to devise and implement suitable strategies and interventions.\nAs a member of the Sahel region, the  Gambia fully supports the implementation of the new United Nations Support Plan for the Sahel, anchored in the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel. We are optimistic that it will contribute significantly to addressing the challenges of development in the Sahel, as well as to fostering peace, security and cross- border relations. We are particularly excited that the new strategy views the Sahel as a land of opportunity and not of hopelessness. Given that fact, we envisage that it will yield important dividends for Africa, especially with regard to the maintenance of peace and security and the elimination of terrorism in the region. Strategically, we must disrupt all criminal networks and the financing of criminal sales of organs and body parts, using better information-sharing and cross- border security initiatives.\nAs we battle those negative forces and try to fulfil our aspirations of silencing the guns on the African continent by 2020, we are worried about the state of United Nations peacekeeping missions in some of our trouble spots, especially in view of the drastic cuts to the peacekeeping budget. The lack of the critical resources needed to support peacekeeping is quite worrisome. The Gambia supports the introduction of appropriate reforms to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations for both peacebuilding and peacekeeping, and they should be reconsidered and maintained as important priorities on the Organization\u2019s agenda. My Government proposes that we do a better job of protecting the lives not only of innocent civilians but  also  of  the  men and women who constitute the peacekeepers. At this juncture, I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the gallant peacekeepers who have fallen. We call on our partners to rise to the challenge and stop the prolongation of conflicts, and we therefore support the Secretary-General\u2019s agenda for reform.\n \nAs Africans, we must assume leadership for maintaining peace and security in our continent. In that respect, I commend the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea for the extraordinary efforts they have made to bring lasting peace to the Horn of Africa, setting an example for the  rest  of  the  continent  to  emulate.  Similarly, I applaud the leaders  of  South  Sudan  for  agreeing to restore peace and work towards developing their country. We call on the leaders of Libya and the Central African Republic to intensify their efforts through political dialogue for national reconciliation and peace.\nMy  Government  reaffirms  its  strong  support for a two-State solution to establish peace between  the Palestinians and their neighbours. We also unconditionally recognize the One China policy. Similarly, we recognize the support provided by the Government and the people of Bangladesh to address the plight of the Rohingya Muslims. As the upcoming Chair of the next summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Gambia has undertaken, through a resolution, to champion an accountability mechanism that would ensure that perpetrators of the terrible crimes against the Rohingya Muslims are brought to book.\nWhile it is our strong desire to see reform that enables the Secretary-General to  operate effectively, it is equally expected that the reforms also facilitate the successful implementation of the  2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development. Reform of the Security Council is long overdue. I want to remind the Assembly that the process truly reflects all interests and positions represented in the intergovernmental negotiations.  We are convinced that Africa\u2019s voice should be fully represented on the Security Council.\nMy delegation looks forward to a successful seventy-third session, and we hope that the President\u2019s election will strengthen efforts aimed at highlighting the plight of rural women and girls.\nBefore I conclude, let me express our sincere condolences to the family of the late former Secretary- General Kofi Annan. Mr. Annan was a formidable voice on everything, including reform of the United Nations. He stood for a just world and was a passionate advocate of good governance and fundamental freedoms. Kofi Annan will surely be greatly missed.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, our Latin American sister, on her election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I also want to pay tribute to Kofi Annan, whose commendable work at the helm of the United Nations left us a great legacy in the defence of peace and a fairer international economic order. And I would like to express the condolences of El Salvador on the recent death of the President of the Republic of Viet Nam, Tran Dai Quang. We also want to express our solidarity with the Government and the people of the United States for the effects of Hurricane Florence and those in the Philippines and China who have been affected by the devastating climate events in their countries.\nThis year brings us together under the theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. It is our responsibility to reach out to all, without discrimination of any kind, with intelligent and effective public policies and tools that meet the needs and aspirations of our people. That has been a priority for El Salvador during my Administration. The social protection programmes we have promoted were decisive in lifting more than 400,000 people out of poverty between 2015 and 2017. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has become a crucial reference point for the implementation\n \nof our national policies. We were among the earliest countries to adapt the 2030 Agenda to its purpose of mitigating the consequences of decades of serious social inequality and repairing the State\u2019s historical lack of interest in the needs and demands of the people.\nEl Salvador joins the call of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres regarding the urgent need to close the gaps in the financing of the Sustainable Development Goals. To that end, we have allocated nearly 50 per cent of the national budget to social development, an unprecedented investment for my country. But even with all of our efforts, our  national  financing  will not be sufficient. The international community must also honour its commitments in this regard. Those contributions must respond to a comprehensive, long- term perspective in order to ensure inclusive economic growth and end poverty for the millions of people who are suffering the worst consequences of climate change and the unfair distribution of wealth. In the case of middle-income countries such as El Salvador, the key lies in supporting and supplementing our financing capacities, particularly from public sources.\nOur country is dealing with multiple vulnerabilities. We  recently  suffered  one  of  the  longest  droughts in our history, a reality that climate change has inflicted on us. That obliges us to invest additional resources in order to guarantee families food security and keep food prices stable. If we are to tackle that situation, it is crucial to ensure that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change continues to be implemented and the current Green Climate Fund crisis is resolved. As a country that hardly pollutes globally but suffers the effects of climate change caused by others, El Salvador urgently needs access to financing for climate-change mitigation and adaptation action that will improve its population\u2019s security and resilience. Our adoption in Bonn of a global initiative at the twenty-third Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has enabled us to move forward with the large-scale restoration of our ecosystems and to become an example of a small country with limited financial resources capable of protecting its environment. I am deeply  grateful to Mr. Erik Solheim, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, for supporting our proposal to declare 2021-2030 a United Nations decade of ecosystem restoration. We invite the General Assembly to consider this initiative aimed at coordinating our efforts to counter the accelerated loss of forests and\nthe degradation of soils and ecosystems, which have a negative effect on the well-being of 3.2 billion people.\nAs one of the Heads of State who in 2015 adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at a memorable and historic General Assembly meeting (see A/70/PV.4), today I can affirm that we have made great progress in combating poverty and reducing inequalities. My Government has given priority to social protection programmes through development strategies that enabled us to reduce poverty by 10 per cent between 2009 and 2017. Through our critical national literacy programme we have declared 100 municipalities free of illiteracy, including San Salvador, which became the third Central American capital to record that educational achievement. That effort continues with our firm commitment to achieving a literate country,  a noble task in which we have  the  generous support of more than 50,000 young volunteers, advocates and other sectors of society. The support of the people and Government of our sister Republic of Cuba has been essential to that success. Its Yo S\u00ed Puedo campaign is a model for the eradication of illiteracy to Latin America and the world.\nAs part of our defence of women\u2019s rights,  we  have developed a strategy for the prevention of the killing of women and sexual violence  that involves  all Government institutions in empowering women and ensuring that they can live free of violence. The strategy, which has been strengthened by the Spotlight Initiative with support from the European Union and the United Nations, seeks to eradicate social and institutional practices that are damaging to women\u2019s dignity. We have also strengthened the internationally recognized Ciudad Mujer programme, which has been implemented in several countries and has provided care to more than 1.8 million women through health services, defence of women\u2019s rights, skills training and financing for economic projects. On the health front, the implementation of our national strategic plan for the reduction of maternal mortality stands out, as well as our national health surveillance plan. Both have helped El Salvador reduce its maternal mortality rate, which in 2017 dropped to 31 per 100,000 live births.\nIn our pursuit of those  urgent  efforts  we  have the spiritual guidance, the message of peace and the promotion of social justice of blessed Archbishop \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero, who on 14 October will be canonized by Pope Francis, a historic event that our people are celebrating with profound joy and hope.\n \nA topic of special relevance at the global and regional levels is migration. My country looks forward to welcoming the prompt adoption of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and the global compact on refugees as clear examples of the leading role of the United Nations in the search for a new global consensus. We must approach migration from a human rights perspective in order to  realize  its benefits and address the challenges it represents. This year many migrant families, mainly from the northern-triangle countries of Central America, have been dealing with the difficult and painful situation of separation, which has caused irreparable psychological and emotional damage to the children and adolescents involved. We believe that the best interests of children and their families  should  be  respected,  regardless  of their immigration status. I reiterate El Salvador\u2019s request to the United States authorities to speed up   the reunification process for minors entering their country at its southern border, whether or not they were accompanied by their families.\nIn recent years, El Salvador has worked to create better living conditions through the promotion of investment, the development of human capital, security, the prevention of violence and the fight against criminal trafficking networks and drug trafficking, among other initiatives, actions that have enabled  us to reduce irregular migratory flows of Salvadorans to the United States by 60 per cent. El Salvador rejects the criminalization of  migrants,  since  experience has shown that their industriousness contributes  to the economic, social and cultural development of destination societies. Our compatriots protected by the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programmes, who for years have contributed to progress in the United States, are a clear example of that. As a Government we are working to make sure that the competent United States authorities guarantee the legal instruments required  to provide the population in the United States under TPS and DACA with greater migratory stability and permanent residence.\nAs a founding State of the United Nations and a country respectful of international law, El Salvador recognizes the importance of multilateralism in addressing such global challenges as peace, a more just economic order, climate change, migration and sustainable development. In that context,  we  stress the need for constructive dialogue, concerted action\nand cooperation and the strengthening of integration mechanisms and regional alliances. In the face of crises and conflicts affecting the world, it is important to give priority to dialogue and political solutions. That was our approach on 30 June in Santo Domingo, at the Meeting of Presidents of the Central American Integration System countries, where we stated our  position  on the situation in our sister republic of Nicaragua. We reiterate the call for dialogue and consensus as the necessary paths for the construction and maintenance of peace, with respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.\nIn order for the international community to make steady progress towards development,  we  must  put an end to unilateral measures such as the unjust and anachronistic economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the  United  States.  That coercive measure must end because it causes incalculable harm to the Cuban people. The same goes for the economic siege against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which affects its international payments and its ability to obtain goods and services, as well as its people\u2019s living conditions. We stand for respect for the self-determination and sovereignty of the Venezuelan people and condemn any external interference or threats of military intervention.\nI thank the United Nations system and Secretary- General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for the valuable support they provide to our development programmes for the well- being and tranquillity of Salvadoran families. We are also grateful for their assistance in and support for a national dialogue process towards  the  development of new national agreements, a continuation of the peace accords that we signed in January 1992. I reaffirm El Salvador\u2019s commitment to helping make the work of the United Nations relevant to all people and to global leadership, with a view to advancing humankind\u2019s aspiration to achieve peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. My Government continues to work tirelessly to that end. We are confident that with the commitments we have undertaken to fulfil the 2030 Agenda, we are moving forward with the building of a united, prosperous and peaceful El Salvador.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the Government and the people of Tuvalu, to address the General Assembly and to congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. Tuvalu has full confidence in her leadership, which will, together with the Secretary- General\u2019s support, further advance our work in the United Nations.\nTuvalu also reaffirms its commitment to the noble values and principles of the United Nations, of which Tuvalu has great pride in being a Member since it joined in 2000. We also want to acknowledge with sincere affection the passing of the late Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General, and his outstanding contributions to the work of this body while leading us from the dusk of the previous century into the dawn of the twenty- first century, which included the considered admission of my country to this great Organization.\nWe welcome the critical theme of the current general debate, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant for all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for  peaceful,  equitable  and sustainable  societies\u201d.  It rightly reminds us that we now need responsible global leadership more than ever \u2014 leadership that values multilateralism and trust and takes  seriously the moral responsibility to help those who need help. That is the leadership that the world needs in order to succeed against the defining global challenges facing the United Nations, in particular in connection with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the role of that Agenda in combating climate change and environmental degradation.\nThis year was characterized by the fear of a potential nuclear war, as if we had not learned from the wrongs of our past. Now we have nuclear weapons that are much more powerful than those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Numerous nuclear tests in our Pacific region have caused unimaginable damage to the environment and the health of our people. Some of our islands continue to cope with the effects of nuclear radiation decades after those tests. The recent Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting in Nauru reaffirmed our commitment to peace and security in the Pacific region. In the Boe Declaration on Regional Security for the Pacific region we called for  urgent  actions with regard to not only military, but also human security issues. In that spirit, two days ago, Tuvalu signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which provides the international community with an opportunity to ban such weapons. We urge all to take concrete actions to make our world safe.\n \nNon-communicable diseases and tuberculosis hit the poor and vulnerable particularly hard and drive them deeper into poverty. We commend the successful outcomes of the high-level meetings of the General Assembly on those issues, but rhetoric alone is not enough. It must be followed by meaningful action on the ground to promote healthy lifestyles and diets, supported by adequate financing and monitoring modalities so as to ensure integrated progress. Addressing that issue urgently is critical, and to that end we in Tuvalu have introduced healthy lifestyles with our initiative of afternoon sweat-breaks every Friday provided to all workers in places of work and villages to encourage a more active and healthier lifestyle. We need practical support, however, in the form of funding and resources from the United Nations, as well as the international community.\nFor small island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries, the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals depends entirely on how we address issues of climate change. The current global warming trend spells a very bleak and miserable future for small island developing States, especially for low-lying atolls such as Tuvalu \u2014 a future that demands huge investments in mitigation and adaptation that are simply beyond our capabilities. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change offers us a lifeline.\nBut the current commitments contained in the Paris Agreement constitute only a third of what is required in order to avoid the catastrophic consequences of climate change, which poses a direct threat to our existence and survival. As already established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), unless the global community steps up its actions to significantly lower greenhouse-gas emissions, SIDS like Tuvalu will disappear completely within the next 30 to 50 years \u2014 disappear completely. I repeat once again what I said at the twenty-first Conference of Parties in Paris: \u201cJust imagine if you were in my shoes, how you would feel. And what would you do?\u201d\nClimate change is a weapon of  mass destruction. It is slaughtering fellow human beings throughout the world. The United Nations cannot and must not allow the biggest greenhouse-gas emitters to turn away from their moral duty and responsibility to urgently reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to save SIDS like Tuvalu by providing the appropriate adaptation support and resources. It would be shameful if all of humankind allowed Tuvalu to disappear. Every single year wasted\nwith no action taken on climate change draws Tuvalu a year closer to its total demise on Earth.\nBut Tuvalu will never give up. We will fight to protect and save our islands, our people, our culture and our future. We appeal to this noble Assembly not to allow such consequences to happen. Tuvalu, whose islands and lagoons were used by the American forces in the Second World War to conquer the enemy in the Pacific, urges President Trump and the United States of America to rejoin the Paris Agreement so that we can all paddle together to save the world against our single most threatening enemy, namely, climate change. Failing that, Tuvalu proposes that we, the signatories of the Paris Agreement, quickly return to Paris to critically and urgently reassess our mitigation pledges and dramatically increase our efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas pollution. We cannot allow one country to desert the process and derail our collective efforts.\nThe next Conference of Parties in Poland is a critically important milestone for climate-change action. We must ensure that the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement are concluded. We must also ensure that the Talanoa Dialogue process leads to a strong political declaration and decision that respond adequately to the IPCC 1.5\u00b0C  report and  set a pathway for enhanced climate-change action. In that regard, we seek a commitment from every nation to enhance its efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions as a matter of urgency. We in Tuvalu are fully committed to shifting to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020 despite our negligible greenhouse-gas emissions.\nI extend our deep appreciation to the Governments of India and France for their initiative on solar-energy development as part of the International Solar Alliance and to the European Union, New Zealand, Taiwan, Italy, Austria, Japan and the World Bank for their support for energy efficiency and solar-energy development in my country, Tuvalu. I wish to acknowledge the efforts of notable members of the Security Council in bringing climate change to the fore of its peace and security agenda. That represents a genuine commitment to addressing the most important challenges  of  our time and the greatest single threat to humankind. It    is our humble hope that the entire Security Council membership can agree to include climate change as a permanent agenda item.\nWe believe that the nexus between climate change and security is fundamental. For a nation like Tuvalu,\n \nsecurity and the future are contingent upon urgent action to address climate change. We therefore reiterate our call for the appointment of a special representative of the Secretary-General on climate change and security. We also call on the Security Council to appoint a special rapporteur to produce a regular review of global, regional and national security threats caused by climate change.\nWe welcome the successful conclusion of the intergovernmental negotiation on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and commend the spirit of responsible leadership and multilateral cooperation extended to efforts to support the ever- increasing populations that are being affected by conflicts and environmental crises, We believe, however, that all human rights of  people displaced as a result of climate change should be protected under an international legal agreement. We therefore reiterate Tuvalu\u2019s proposal for a United Nations resolution on the establishment of a legal process to protect the human rights of people displaced by climate change.\nThis year, Tuvalu proposed that it remain a least developed country, because its ability to achieve sustainable development is being severely compromised by its vulnerability to climate change. We noted with appreciation the support that we have received from development partners and friends to advance that proposal. However, it is our earnest belief that the unique and extreme vulnerabilities of small island developing States must be considered as a fundamental criterion for graduation.\nThe particular concerns of highly vulnerable SIDS, like Tuvalu, cannot be ignored. In our national strategy for sustainable development \u2014 Te Kakeega \u2014 our unique vulnerability is recognized as enemy number one hampering our efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In that regard, we call on the Economic and Social Council to create a special category for SIDS so that we can be afforded special considerations in a similar fashion to those  received by the least developed countries. We note the recently released report of the Secretary-General on the assessment resulting from the evolving mandates of the small island developing States units of the Secretariat (A/73/345). The expanded responsibilities  of  the SIDS unit in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the Office  of  the  High  Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing\nStates should be matched with expanded resources. We also welcome the review of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and hope  that that review will truly reflect and respond to the unique circumstances affecting SIDS and their unique economic, environmental and social vulnerability. In the South Pacific region,  we  are taking small steps  to address that vulnerability. We are in the process of developing a Pacific Island climate-change insurance facility. We seek support from the United Nations-wide system to assist us in developing that facility.\nOur small-island economy is inextricably linked to the oceans. The oceans are what we are, our culture, our life and our survival, but global warming, acidification, coral bleaching, solid wastes and plastic pollution and diminishing inshore and offshore stocks of fisheries, on which national economies depend, are gravely affecting the oceans. The United Nations must provide the strongest possible leadership to drive genuine partnerships to address those issues.\nThe exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations system has denied its 23 million people the enjoyment of their fundamental rights to participate in and benefit from the United Nations. Taiwan is already a responsible and able partner with Tuvalu and many other countries in many regions of the world, and could do even more if it were allowed to assume its rightful place and role in our global efforts to achieve sustainable development. Tuvalu believes that the United Nations has to make the arrangements necessary to enable Taiwan to participate in meetings, activities and mechanisms within the framework of United Nations processes, including those of the relevant United Nations  specialized agencies. In a similar vein, we believe that the long-standing unilateral economic embargo on trade with Cuba directly constrains the development aspirations of the people of that country. It neglects the human rights and the spirit of cooperation espoused by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Likewise, we believe that the United Nations must also engage with the people of West Papua to find lasting solutions to their struggles.\nIn August 2019, Tuvalu will host the fiftieth Pacific Islands Forum of leaders. I extend our humble invitation to all Pacific Island Forum leaders, our friends and especially our bilateral and multilateral development partners to join us in Tuvalu. It will still be there, I hope. We want to put on record our deepest appreciation to the Government of Taiwan for their generous support in helping us prepare for that important and large-scale\n \nregional event. Similarly, I want to acknowledge similar support from the Governments of India, Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea in helping us host the next year\u2019s Forum.\nOn 1 October, next Monday, Tuvalu will celebrate its fortieth anniversary of independence. While holding high our national pride as an independent nation, we fully acknowledge that Tuvalu could never have achieved such status without the due consideration of Members of this body, to whom, on behalf of the people of Tuvalu, I now offer our sincere gratitude. In our striding forward, we acknowledge with deep appreciation, the generosity of all our development partners, particularly our traditional partners: the Republic of China, Taiwan, India, the Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and many others. As we paddle our canoe forward for the next 40 years, we seek the continuing goodwill of the United Nations family to further advance our achievements based on genuine and durable partnerships.\nIn conclusion, Tuvalu strongly believes that its collective effort to achieve the aspirations of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to secure global peace, security and prosperity will be severely compromised unless we all paddle together, as a family, to urgently address climate change and save Tuvalu and the world. God bless Tuvalu. God bless the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "This year, as we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of one of the greatest sons of humankind, the late Nelson Mandela, I would like to begin my statement with a quote of his: \u201cIt is so easy to break down and destroy. The heroes are those who make peace and build\u201d.\nWe have approached the seventy-third session of the General Assembly with an increased number of problems compared with last year, including a lack of trust and mutual respect. We find ourselves in a state of profound worldwide crisis that touches every aspect of the life of each and every person in our interconnected and rapidly accelerating world. Millions  of  people live under the shadow of dreadful wars, such as in Syria, Yemen and many other corners of the globe. Kazakhstan believes that war can never be a lasting solution to any problem.\nBased on that conviction and sharing the belief that the only viable solution to the current crisis in Syria is an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, we launched\n \nthe Astana process to strengthen confidence-building measures among the conflicting parties in Syria.\nOur far-reaching commitment is  embodied  in  the 2016 anti-war manifesto,  entitled  The  World. 21st Century, by Kazakhstan\u2019s President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stated in that treatise that the main tool for resolving all  disputes between States should be peaceful dialogue and constructive negotiations on the basis of equal responsibility for peace and security, mutual respect and non-interference in domestic affairs. It is a road map for peace, and it calls for the effective use of all tools available \u2014 from early warning, conflict prevention, diplomacy and mediation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding to sustainable development.\nAt a time of crisis, we believe that it is of the utmost importance for the United Nations to stay close to the people around the world and to ensure that no one is left behind. We have to overcome differences and reaffirm our shared commitments to the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nMy country has become a net contributor to peace, security and stability, as well as to economic and social development, not only in our region but far beyond. We have carefully preserved peace and harmony in our multi-ethnic and multireligious society by stressing and enforcing the equality and dignity of every citizen. We have achieved that while also creating an effective economic model \u2014 our economy has grown more than 20 times from the day that my country emerged as an independent State.\nLooking forward, Kazakhstan has a clear vision for its future development. By 2050, we seek to become one of the top 30 most advanced economies in the world, meeting the highest global standards in terms of economic performance and transparent governance, especially the demanding standards of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nAs a new model of economic growth, President Nazarbayev announced his plan in his annual address earlier this year, called \u201cNew development opportunities under the fourth  industrial  revolution\u201d.  It  outlines the path for our country to follow in order to achieve those ambitious goals. That new  road  map  focuses on industrialization, the further development of our resource potential, the use of smart technologies, which provide a chance for a breakthrough in the development of our agricultural industry, increasing the efficiency of transport and logistics infrastructure, relaunching\nthe financial sector, and strengthening human capital as the basis of modernization.\nAt the global level President Nazarbayev has put forward the G-Global initiative, an information and technology (ICT) platform aimed at ensuring wide and inclusive dialogue on the need to find common solutions for global economic and financial shortcomings. The platform unites prominent international scientists, entrepreneurs and politicians.\nIn the regional context, we are committed to further extending our partnership with Central Asian countries and to enhancing our common capability to withstand threats and challenges. Today in Central Asia a new reality has been formed. We consider the political, economic and cultural potential of the region to be a common resource, the most rational and effective use of which is achievable only in a collective format.\nOur shared goal is to create a model for a zone of peace, security, trust, development and cooperation in our region of Central Asia and beyond. Several features of such a zone are already in place, as exemplified by the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States, the International Fund for Saving the  Aral Sea  and the latest Summit of that Fund, which demonstrated strong political collaboration among regional leaders on subjects including the establishment of a nuclear- weapon-free zone in Central Asia and other mechanisms.\nBeing the first country from the region to be represented on the Security Council, we have deepened our focus on the situation in Afghanistan with its full implications and threats in the broader regional context. Moreover, Kazakhstan has for many years contributed significantly to peace in and the rehabilitation of that country. We believe that the revival of that country as a prosperous and peaceful neighbour will have a positive impact on overall security in our region. A special role in that process should be played by Afghan women.\nIn order to increase international awareness and support for the needs of  Afghan  women  and  girls, we hosted the Regional Conference on Empowering Women in Afghanistan in September in Astana.  It was attended by female politicians, parliamentarians, entrepreneurs and civil-society members from Afghanistan and the Eurasian region. The event gave great impetus to strengthening the  role  of  women, not only in Afghanistan but in the whole region of Central Asia, thereby helping to improve their lives and influence their futures.\n \nNew globalization trends have revealed cross-border threats and challenges, which requires a new paradigm to address them. Those transnational challenges are specific, but common to particular regions, especially conflict-prone ones, and they necessitate a transition from a country-specific to a regional strategy to tackle them. A regional strategy becomes effective with the whole-of-system coordination of the activities of United Nations structures region-wide.\nAs a  pilot  case,  we  offer  the  establishment  of  a United Nations regional hub for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Almaty, our southern capital. The city already hosts more than a dozen United Nations offices with regional, subregional and multi-country mandates. That solid United Nations field presence has successfully promoted the SDGs in our region for years, and I am happy to announce that, as a host country, we will provide those offices with a state-of-the-art, fully equipped and furnished building, specifically designated and designed as per United Nations and international requirements, by the end of the year.\nAs an example of regional cooperation, I would also like to outline the results of the Caspian Summit held a month ago in the city of Aktau, in western Kazakhstan. We all are extremely satisfied and proud that the long-awaited legal status of the Caspian Sea has been agreed on and determined by the five littoral countries. The treaty creates a solid legal basis for further comprehensive interaction among all the Caspian States, strengthening regional security and stability, as well as the efficient use of sea resources. I would like to emphasize that the Caspian Sea has become an area of peace, harmony, good-neighbourliness and enhanced international cooperation.\nToday, the ability of countries to show global leadership and responsibility is being challenged by numerous threats \u2014 from the spread of both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), terrorism, extremism, organized crime and all forms of trafficking, to food, water, energy and health insecurity the violation of human rights, particularly the rights of women, youth and children, which degrades human dignity, and the lack of respect and justice for all.\nKazakhstan is trying its best to stay in the vanguard of efforts to tackle those international challenges and to seek innovative solutions to them. We fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to implement his\nreforms of the peace and security architecture and the United Nations development system and management. We will contribute to improving shared responsibility for, transparency and the overall coordination of all United Nations bodies with a view to achieving those goals. We are engaged in reforming the methods of work of the Security Council so as to enhance its relevance, transparency, accountability and effective capacity to respond speedily to varying crises.\nKazakhstan remains committed to strengthening peacekeeping by ensuring clear and achievable mandates, highly qualified personnel and adequate resources. We will increase our contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations through innovative forms of partnerships, including co-deployment. We will deploy a unit and additional officers to United Nations peacekeeping missions during this seventy- third session and expand their number in future.\nBeing fully supportive of the concept of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention and confidence-building, the President of Kazakhstan initiated the creation of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, as well as the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia, which comprises 27 countries, spanning from the Middle to the Far East and South-East Asia.\nMy country has proved itself to be a moral leader in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, after having renounced the world\u2019s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal and the world\u2019s largest nuclear test site, in Semipalatinsk. We call upon all other countries to follow our example, as nuclear weapons do not ensure either real power or true protection. Protection comes from trust in the international community.\nKazakhstan signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons on 2 March, following its engaged participation in the elaboration and adoption of the Treaty. We are now processing its ratification. The early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty remains a key goal for us. Our country, one of the most impacted by the harmful consequences of nuclear tests, is making great efforts to bring the world to global zero. We therefore sponsored resolution 64/35, which established the International Day against Nuclear Tests. Three weeks ago, the States Members of the United Nations commemorated the ninth observance of the Day, with the General Assembly firmly supporting an urgent and complete end to all nuclear testing.\n \nThe creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones remains one of the most  effective  measures  for  combating the spread of WMDs. With that in mind, President Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed strengthening cooperation among nuclear-weapon-free zones and convening inter-zone conferences on a regular basis. Astana proposes hosting the first such meeting.\nWe have also steadfastly advocated for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and call on all the parties involved to agree on mutually acceptable conditions to sustain the negotiation  process.  We also support preserving and ensuring the proper implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran, as well as a thorough investigation of chemical-weapons crimes in Syria and the prevention of chemical terrorism.\nCountering terrorism is of special  significance for my country. Kazakhstan has ratified 16 of the 19 United Nations instruments on combating terrorism, with measures taken for the early accession to the remaining three treaties. Stronger global leadership in fighting terrorism remains crucial. We must do more to address the roots of radicalization, using best practices and relevant United Nations instruments.\nWe are actively working under the Joint Plan of Action for the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia. Having contributed $300,000, Kazakhstan has become the first donor to its third phase, and we thank other donors too.\nIn his address to the General Assembly in 2015  (see A/70/PV.13), President Nazarbayev put forward several counter-terrorism initiatives: the creation of a global counter-terrorism coalition or network and the adoption of a comprehensive United Nations document on combating terrorism. In that context, our country has offered the Code of  Conduct towards Achieving   a World Free of Terrorism and invites all countries to closely coordinate in the fight against that evil. We commend all our partners for their support. The Code signing ceremony was held earlier this afternoon at a special high-level event, with more than 70 Member States having endorsed the document, for which we are very grateful. The Code remains open for signature by other States, and we invite them all to manifest their goodwill in fighting that disastrous phenomenon.\nOur strong conviction is that comprehensive success in the area of hard security is impossible without\nsuccess in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We have launched a number of initiatives to implement the SDGs: the renowned international Expo 2017 exhibition on the theme of future energy; the Post-Expo International Centre for Green Technologies and Investment Projects; the Astana International Financial Centre; the annual Astana Economic Forum; the KazAlD development agency; the Regional Hub of the Civil Service; the Regional Centre for Disaster Risk Reduction; and the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Centre for combating illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors. All those and many other projects have many promising prospects for the future.\nKazakhstan is the world\u2019s largest landlocked country, and it is also a part of the biggest landlocked region of Central Asia and Afghanistan, and the farthest away from any ocean. It has made many strides in achieving connectivity and in turning what can be termed \u201clandlockedness\u201d into \u201clandlinkedness\u201d.\nBased on the outcomes of the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action and working together to fulfil the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action for the landlocked least developed countries (LLDCs), we are working to further expand communications, enhance infrastructure, boost trade and transit, counter climate change and improve energy security. Recently, we hosted the LLDCs\u2019 Ministerial Meeting on Trade and Trade Facilitation in Astana.\nWe are ready to share our experiences in promoting the goals of our large-scale third modernization programme, geared towards joining the top 30 most developed nations, and we offer our assistance to developing countries. In that context, South-South cooperation is gaining importance for us. Together with the United Nations system and other partners we will continue to extend assistance to African countries. We will work under the Africa-Kazakhstan partnership for the SDGs, and we will continue to work with small island developing States.\nThe recent establishment of the Islamic Organization for Food Security in Astana will contribute to humanitarian assistance efforts through the creation of food reserves. Also, a  new  initiative  of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in  the  area of science and technology will serve the purpose of narrowing the digital and ICT gap between the developed and the developing countries.\n \nMr.  Ten-Pow  (Guyana),  Vice-President,   took the Chair.\nKazakhstan\u2019s hallmarks, among many others, are pluralism and interfaith accord. They are promoted through an unprecedented dialogue platform, namely, the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions in Astana. The sixth Congress of that kind will take place next month in Astana. Its added value is that it brings together religious and political leaders, international organizations and civil society and turns the paradigm of conflict and clashes of cultures and religions into a unique model of tolerance and harmony. President Nazarbayev has unveiled a new programme of spiritual modernization of Kazakh society called \u201cspiritual enlightenment\u201d, which blends traditional with contemporary elements. I can convey the essence of the initiative by recalling his words that in dreaming of our great future, we should not forget about our worthy past.\nBefore I conclude, I reiterate that it is only through our collective will and solidarity that we can turn this world in crisis into a world of hope and promise. The United Nations should stay open and relevant to all people, since it is our common responsibility to leave  a strengthened and well-used heritage to move towards peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies where no one is left behind.\nIn conclusion I  want to refer again to the words of Nelson  Mandela, namely,  that it  is  in our hands  to create a better world for all who  live  in  it.  We need to turn our goodwill and good words into good actions. That is what we desperately need today. The President of Kazakhstan, His Excellency Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, clearly stated that the time to look ahead is now; the time for action is now; the time to show our will is now; and the time to make a difference is now.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to start by paying tribute to Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his vision in leading the United Nations. Finland wholeheartedly supports him in his important task.\nMy country has always been a strong advocate of multilateral cooperation. For Finland, the rules-based international order is of fundamental importance. At home, being able to rely on commonly agreed rules is a cornerstone of our own national security and welfare. At the global level, common solutions and rules are needed to address the most pressing challenges of our time.\nUnfortunately, for those of us who believe in the benefits of multilateralism, there is  now  reason  to  be worried. The international system that we have built together is under pressure and its capability and credibility are being questioned. We can no longer take the rules-based order for granted. It is our common responsibility to actively defend and develop it.\nFinland sees the United Nations as the core of the multilateral system. The defence of multilateralism\n \nmust therefore begin here. The United Nations and    its Members need to show their will to act together, not past each other. We fully support the Secretary- General\u2019s ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda. Now is the time to implement those reforms. We must ensure that the United Nations of the future is more transparent, accountable and efficient.\nFor the United Nations to be credible, it has to practice what it preaches. For any organization, every single case of sexual exploitation in its own ranks is one case too much. That is particularly true for an organization that stresses the importance of equality and human rights. I am proud to be a member of the Circle of Leadership on Preventing and  Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, and I welcome the efforts taken to prevent and combat all forms of abuse throughout the United Nations system.\nThe three pillars of the United Nations \u2014 peace and security, human rights and development \u2014 have stood the test of time. However, we have also discovered that many present global challenges do not respect the boundaries among them. The pillars are increasingly interlinked, as are the challenges themselves. The most important achievements of the United Nations system in recent years are testimony to that. In that regard, I refer to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement and the global compact for migration and the global compact on refugees. Issues such as sustainability, climate change and migration are not only about development and human rights, but they are also essential questions of peace and security.\nClimate change is the prime example of the need for prompt global action.  The  upcoming  report  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will further underscore the urgency of our response. It will also show how much remains to be done. So far, the voluntary contributions from the States parties to the Paris Agreement are not enough to keep the global temperature rise well below 2\u00b0C. We must do a lot more, and more quickly.\nIn the North, we are witnessing how the Arctic region is warming at an alarming pace. That is  not just a regional problem, as it poses a threat to the entire global climate system. One important factor in accelerating the melting of sea ice in the Arctic is black carbon emissions. Reducing black carbon that lands on the white ice would have immediate positive effects  in preventing melting. A commitment to curbing\nthose emissions would be a key objective of an Arctic summit, which Finland, as the current Chair of the Arctic Council, is ready to host.\nWithout mitigation, climate change will also lead to a further increase in migration flows. Approximately\n65 million people across the world are already displaced, the highest figure since the Second World War. About 100 million people worldwide are in urgent need of basic humanitarian assistance, and that number is growing. There are no quick and easy solutions, but doing nothing is not an option. I therefore welcome  the global compact for migration and look forward to participating in the conference to adopt it in Marrakesh in December.\nFull-scale wars, conflicts of varying  intensity  and breaches of international law continue to haunt  us. They constantly remind us of the immense human suffering involved. We, the international community, need to remain persistent in our efforts to solve ongoing conflicts, regardless of how deep-rooted and long- lasting they may be.\nOn a positive note, we have been encouraged by recent attempts to hold a genuine dialogue between  the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the international community. The momentum to take steps towards a peaceful  Korean  peninsula  should be maintained and supported. A successful outcome  in that region could also set a powerful example for non-proliferation and disarmament elsewhere.\nWhere peace has been achieved, the relevance of United Nations peacekeeping remains beyond doubt. But the Blue Helmets will also need to adapt to changing realities. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative to make United Nations peacekeeping more effective.\nWhile existing conflicts need to be solved, our priority must be to prevent future ones. Finland welcomes the efforts to strengthen the United Nations conflict-prevention capacity. Mediation is an invaluable tool when it comes to conflict prevention. It is vital for the future of mediation that experience gained in the past be passed on to future mediators. It was an honour for my country to host the meeting of the Secretary- General\u2019s High-level Advisory Board on Mediation in June. We remain strong supporters of the mediation activities of the United Nations and other actors. Where appropriate, Finland also continues to offer its good\n \noffices to facilitate concrete discussions among parties, from track-two diplomacy to high-level meetings.\nPeace and security, human rights and development are not sustainable without the  participation  of women and youth. Female voices and young voices must be heard and acted upon. The needs of women, children and youth are still all too often marginalized in peace talks. Finland promotes the role of women\u2019s effective participation in peace processes through the Nordic Women Mediator\u2019s Network. That and other similar networks provide a useful platform for advocacy and self-education. As a HeForShe Impact Champion, I highly value those efforts.\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its importance in the international order deserves special attention. Human rights not only protect the individual, but they also help us to prevent conflicts, build sustained peace and speed up development. If we are serious about human rights, then accountability mechanisms for crimes against international law are needed. Perpetrators must be brought to justice. Finland appeals to all Member States and the Secretary-General to consistently keep human rights, non-discrimination and gender equality at the top of the agenda of the United Nations.\nIt was with profound sadness that I learned of the passing of Mr. Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations. His legacy is an inspiration to us all. Like the Secretary-General earlier today, I would like to conclude by remembering the following words from him:\n\u201cMore than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it is my pleasure to congratulate Her Excellency Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I wish her every success in her tasks. I also wish to congratulate her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, President during the previous session, for his efforts. It would be remiss of me not to commend as well the tireless efforts undertaken by His Excellency Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is founded on a great legacy of principles and constant elements that underpin its foreign policy, at the top of which is its permanent ambition to achieve peaceful solutions to conflicts, while preventing their escalation by undertaking mediation efforts in order to achieve that noble objective. Perhaps the best illustration of the responsible political role played by my country in the promotion of international peace and security is the peace agreement concluded recently in the city of Jeddah between Ethiopia and Eritrea, under the auspices of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud. The agreement brought to an end the longest-lasting conflict on the African continent. Another illustration is the historic meeting held under the auspices of my country between the leaders of Eritrea and Djibouti after they had shunned all contacts with each other for 10 years.\nThe Palestinian question has been pivotal for my country and the Islamic world. It is our  conviction that the Palestinian people have the right to build an independent Palestinian State within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with international resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. We reiterate our call to redouble sincere efforts aimed at ending that conflict, which has lasted longer than any other in the region.\nThe Houthi terrorist militias of Iran continue to launch ballistic missiles manufactured and supplied by Iran towards Saudi cities \u2014 there have been 199 such missiles to date. Their activities seek to destabilize the safety and security of navigation in the Bab Al-Mandab region and the Red Sea. My country reiterates our commitment to the need for a political settlement to the situation in Yemen based on three terms of reference, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the outcomes of the Yemeni National Dialogue Conference and Security Council resolution 2216 (2015).\nWe will continue to provide and facilitate all humanitarian efforts to alleviate the disastrous situation facing the brotherly Yemeni people. We also seek to fully support the Yemeni economy, including through the recent deposit of  $2  billion in the Central Bank  of Yemen, which was ordered by His Majesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The humanitarian support provided by\n \nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Yemen over the past four years amounts to more than $13 billion.\nTerrorism and extremism are two of the major challenges faced by the whole world. Our region has not been spared from the scourge of terrorist groups. In that context, we reiterate our call for greater international cooperation to end terrorism in all its forms, cut off its funding sources and punish those who support terrorists or facilitate their activities in any way. The efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to that end are clear to everyone. My country has established institutions to fight extremism and terrorism, namely, the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, made up of more than 40 States, and the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, to which my country has contributed $110 million.\nIran continues its terrorist activities and aggressive behaviour. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses  its support for the new United States strategy for dealing with Iran, which includes seriously addressing its nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes and its support for terrorism. Our country believes that, in order to achieve peace and stability in the  Middle East, it is necessary to deter Iran from exercising its expansionist and subversive policies. Iran has formed armed terrorist militias and provided them with ballistic missiles. It has conducted assassinations targeting diplomats and committed acts of aggression against diplomatic missions. In addition, Iran has stirred up sectarian strife and interfered in the affairs of countries in the region.  Such  aggressive behaviour constitutes a glaring violation of all international covenants and treaties, as well as Security Council resolutions. That is why Iran is under international sanctions.\nAs part of our resolute and continuous efforts to counter terrorism, my country, along with the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Arab Republic of Egypt, has broken off all  contacts with the State of Qatar, a State that continues to support terrorism, sponsor extremists and spread hateful rhetoric through its media, while failing to uphold its obligations under the Riyadh Agreement of 2013 and Riyadh Supplementary Agreement of 2014, which is unacceptable. Qatar has persisted in its practices, which has left us with no choice but to boycott it. In the eighth year of the Syrian crisis, the humanitarian situation requires all of us to shoulder our responsibilities. My country, from the very first day of the outbreak of the crisis, has sought to care for the Syrian people to help them realize their ambitions to live in safety on their own soil. In that regard, we reiterate the need to implement Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) and reach a political solution in line with the principles of the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 (A/66/865, annex). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has worked to unite the Syrian opposition groups so that they can negotiate with the regime and ensure Syria\u2019s security, stability and unity and prevent foreign intervention or any attempt to partition the country.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports legitimacy in Libya. We recall the importance of upholding the Skhirat Agreement to resolve the Libyan crisis, and call for maintaining the unity and territorial integrity of Libya. We underscore our support for the United Nations efforts and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ghassan Salam\u00e9.\nMy country is among the leading donors of humanitarian and development assistance. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has contributed 3.7 per cent of the Saudi gross domestic product, thereby surpassing the percentage called for by the United Nations, namely,\n0.7 per cent of gross domestic product.\nThe international order that has existed for centuries is based on the principle of respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries. Commitment to international norms and laws is of the utmost importance and is not up for discussion. Sovereignty is a red line that cannot be crossed. My country rejects any intervention in its domestic affairs and any form of dictate by any country.\nThe Government of my country, with the firm support of His Majesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud,  Custodian  of  the  Two  Holy   Mosques, and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, has placed its people at the core of development. Based on the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030, my country has opened doors for its citizens so that they can move towards the future, and has empowered young people and sought to benefit from their creative spirit. In addition, it has been employing modern technologies to serve development and make our country a leading environment for investment.\n \nWomen in my country have an active presence at all levels. Empowering women is a governmental goal so that they can have a full opportunity to contribute to development.\nThe vocation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is based on genuine partnership with the world, leading to a prosperous present and a bright future. That would enable the next generations to live in security, stability and peace. We wish our Organization further success in achieving its lofty objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me start by paying tribute to the statesmen and giants of history who have walked these halls and without whom our Organization would not be what it is today, a symbol of unity and cooperation for all the nations in the world. As we celebrate the anniversary of this great Organization, let us pause and reflect on the true purpose that lies at the heart of the United Nations. We must renew our commitment not only to the Charter of the United Nations, but to its founding principles, which must always guide us in our deliberations and actions. Those cooperative values are critical to the continued peace and prosperity of all our nations and peoples. We cannot let them come under threat. As a collective, we must continue to embrace multilateralism, which has underpinned the values of our Organization for nearly three quarters of a century.\nSeychelles continues to embrace the multilateral system that is the United Nations, and we fully support the evolution and progress that will come out of United Nations reform. Those reforms stress the need for a more coordinated approach among the United Nations country teams in order to successfully deliver the  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We consider multilateral cooperation to be of the utmost importance, and in that spirit, on 30 August the Government of Seychelles and its United Nations country team signed their first strategic partnership framework for the period from 2019 to 2023, defining the collective support of 18 United Nations agencies. The challenges that we face in the international system remain a vivid reminder of an evolving world to which we must adapt if we are to secure lasting peace and prosperity. Without targeted approaches that touch the lives of our most vulnerable peoples and without fully embracing the promise of the SDGs, we run the risk of leaving some behind.\nStrong institutions are essential to a vibrant democracy in which there is transparency and accountability to the people. My mandate as President of Seychelles has in part been highlighted by my desire to ensure that our institutions not only serve the people but grant them the necessary recourse  should  they feel the need. Only by strengthening our institutions and binding ourselves to international law and norms can our peoples truly have accountable Governments. Today I call on the advanced economies to support the\n \nstrengthening of institutions in developing nations, not through handouts, but by sharing expertise and best practices for the benefit of all. Only by strengthening institutions can we ensure respect for human rights, the rule of law and independent judiciaries, which in turn will ensure that the future can favour a vibrant democratic order.\nSpeaking from the standpoint of an islander, I cannot dissociate the concept of lasting peace and prosperity from the perils of climate change. Climate change has become an existential threat not merely to the lives of people in island States but to the world as a whole. As islanders, we live that stark reality every day. We see its effects in our eroding coastlines and unpredictable weather patterns, on our coral reefs and rising sea levels. While I recognize the need for development as a driving force to lift our people out of poverty, we must remain aware of its consequences for our planet and our future. Through our neglect, we risk our children inheriting a planet that is beyond their capacity to repair. Should we not uphold the commitments we have made \u2014 from the Paris Climate Change Conference to the Conference of the twenty-third session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Bonn last year under Fiji\u2019s presidency \u2014 we will reach an inescapable crisis.\nI believe in the power of our collective efforts to shape a future of which we can all be proud. In that context, I would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the theme of our seventy-third session, \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared  responsibility  for  peaceful,  equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. The words \u201csustainable societies\u201d have particular resonance for small island developing States (SIDS).\nFor our United Nations to be truly inclusive and keep up with the challenges of an ever-changing world, Seychelles aligns itself firmly with the African Union position calling for the long-overdue and comprehensive reform of the Security Council. That includes the equitable representation of Africa, whose countries make up more than a quarter of the members of the United Nations, after all.\nSustainability has always been and will continue to be at the heart of my country\u2019s development efforts. As a nation, we have shown the world our commitment to that process. Seychelles, alongside its fellow small island developing States, has been actively engaged in\nthat discourse in order to ensure that our concerns and needs are adequately addressed. Our nation was forged by the ocean. We are acutely aware of the challenges that poses with the threat of climate change. However, the ocean also presents a myriad untapped opportunities. At the beginning of this year, my country, Seychelles, pioneered a blue economy strategic policy framework and road map,  to  multiply  the  economic  potential  of our territorial waters while also  protecting  them for generations to come. For us, the blue economy is the next frontier of development. It is about ocean- based sustainable development focusing on economic diversification, shared prosperity, food security and healthy and productive oceans. It is encouraging to note that other like-minded States are developing that concept, regardless of their geography.\nSeychelles is slowly shifting from a dependence on bilateral aid donors to developing innovative sources of financing for our emerging blue economy. We are trying to leverage the wealth of the ocean that surrounds us and engage in exciting new partnerships. Nevertheless, we recognize that will not be enough to meet all our sustainable-development and climate-action obligations under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway. That is why Seychelles is one of those small island developing States that continues to advocate for a SIDS-specific resilience index, which would take into account the unique  vulnerabilities and specificities of small island developing States and better reflect the realities that we face. The agenda of small island developing States is inextricably linked to that of humankind.\nThe United Nations was born of the horrors of a destructive world war. It was charged with upholding the idea that as a collective, we could resolve our differences through dialogue and international diplomacy. Together, we continue to demonstrate the success and unrelenting power of diplomacy and, in the case of smaller States like ours, we have also proved that might is not right. In this unique forum, we have equal representation. Seychelles remains  committed to the ideals of the United Nations and will remain an active voice within this Organization. Today we are being presented with a unique opportunity to transform our world through our collective efforts and to create lasting partnerships. We have a unique opportunity to sculpt a future for our children that they can be proud to\n \ninherit. Let us be on the right side of history and live up to the ideals out of which this Organization was born.\n"

        "file_text": "This November the world will commemorate the  centenary  of  the  end  of the First World War. The war caused the fall of empires and opened a window for small nations in Europe, including Lithuania, to achieve their dreams of living independently and freely, enjoying their culture and traditions.\nTo prevent such a war from ever happening again, multilateral institutions were created to safeguard political independence and territorial integrity. Yet when the world faced its next big crisis, those institutions\n \nfailed to act and remained powerless bystanders as humankind plunged into another world war.\nToday we would like to think that our multilateral institutions, including the United Nations, are strong enough to take a stand against aggression and a disregard of international rules. But sometimes reality tells a different story. We see a world that is more fractured, with institutions that are crumbling, instead of one that is sheltering us from the use of force and from economic storms. In almost every major crisis of the past decade, from Syria to Ukraine and from Myanmar to Yemen, the Security Council has been unable to play a meaningful role because of the inability of States to rise above their national interests and because of the obstructive use of the veto power.\nOrganizations created to abolish weapons of mass destruction are toothless against dictators who develop nuclear arms and use chemical weapons on civilians. As the tide begins to turn for the global economy, the World Trade Organization is starting to face paralysis. Rising global tensions  in  trade  could  wipe  away  our achievements in sustainable development and poverty reduction.\nWe must therefore recognize that our institutions are not perfect. They can be bureaucratic, wasteful and unaccountable. But it was us, the Member States, that created them, and so it is up to us alone to improve and adapt them to new realities. Before we seek to destroy multilateral institutions, commitments or agreements, we must have a clear vision of what we want to build\ninstead. Otherwise we will end  up  living on  a  pile  of ruins.\nWe cannot reject globalization, because fighting it will only make us poorer. Over the past 25 years, free trade has given more than 1 billion people an opportunity to escape extreme poverty. However, globalization also has a dark side, which must be confronted by acting against exclusion, inequality and falling labour standards. We cannot let the voices  of  nationalism and division win over dialogue and  cooperation. On all major challenges \u2014 terrorism, climate change and female empowerment \u2014 there is simply no alternative to working together.\nSo far we have been too quiet, too passive and too ignorant. We must stop taking the easy way out, blaming institutions for our own political or domestic failures. We must recognize that we, the Member States, have the power and resources to enable the United Nations to stand up for peace, freedom, equality and humankind, because we are the United Nations. Let us take this opportunity and assume responsibility for our future, empowering the United Nations to act.\n"

        "file_text": "It is always an honour to take part in this great General Assembly.\nToday we live in a world where new challenges are multiplying and old ones never seem to go away. The multilateral system is being challenged. It is a system that we have spent more than 70 years building and that should prevent humankind from ever again experiencing the horrors of war. It is a system that ensures respect for human rights and international law and that promotes social progress, development and better standards of living for everybody.\nThe case for multilateralism is clear. As Member States, we all have the responsibility to find common solutions to the common threats and challenges we face, while protecting the principles and values of the Charter of the United Nations. That spirit of cooperation and common responsibility must guide our work in the years to come. No nation or State will make gains if it strives only to assert its own interests.\nIn today\u2019s unpredictable world, I urge us all to unite our efforts to strengthen multilateralism as the only viable way to secure peace and security for future generations. My country, Slovenia, stands firm in defence of that multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core. The Republic of Slovenia\u2019s commitment to the multilateral system remains as strong as ever, based on shared values, the rule of law and human rights.\nWe should all strive to make the United Nations a stronger and more efficient Organization, reformed in a way that means it can respond and assist in solving the most pressing concerns of our time. Slovenia strongly supports the reform efforts by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. A lot has been achieved during the past year, but progress needs to continue.\nAt the end of the day, the success of the United Nations reform largely depends on us, the Member States. It depends on our political will and ability to translate words into action for the benefit of all of us. We hope that will also give fresh impetus to the reform of the Security Council in order to secure a fairer representation of today\u2019s world.\nOnly a rules-based international order can guarantee the equality of peoples and nations. If we want to create a more stable, peaceful and just future, Member States must adhere to international law. Respect for international law and the rule of law is\na precondition to living in peace and security for all States \u2014 the entire international community.\nGiven that I come from a country adjacent to the Western Balkans region, I would like to stress the importance of international law and the judgments of international courts in relation to the reconciliation process in that region. Recognizing and accepting historical facts, no matter how painful  they  are,  is the basis for stability and progress, both of which are needed in the Western Balkans region.\nI also wish to emphasize the necessity of full respect for human rights, which is always pertinent, particularly in today\u2019s world. Without that, there can be no peace, security or development. The United Nations has been instrumental in promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms worldwide, but we must not forget that the primary responsibility for their fulfilment lies, once again, with the State. No State rights, emergencies or political reasons can ever excuse the violations of human rights.\nAs the current Chair of the Human Rights Council, Slovenia remains a strong supporter of human rights for all. My country considers it important to ensure that the Council contributes to the strengthening of human rights in the world, perhaps now more than ever before. We must all endeavour to ensure the Council\u2019s credibility and better effectiveness.  We  sincerely hope and expect that the United States of America, a traditional promoter and supporter of respect for human rights around the world, will remain committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. Through dialogue, Slovenia will continue to seek results in the process of strengthening the legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the Human Rights Council.\nWar, violent extremism and terrorism always represent an assault on human rights. Those atrocities shock us to the core of our human conscience. Effective law-enforcement measures are indispensable in the fight against terrorism, but terrorism will never be defeated by security measures alone. Our endeavours to counter and prevent terrorism have to be comprehensive, while also targeting the root causes of radicalization.\nImpunity represents one of the major obstacles to the prevention of the grave and systematic violations of human rights committed against civilians in armed conflicts. All parties to a conflict, including non-State actors, must comply with international humanitarian law. Ending impunity is essential to enabling a war-\n \ntorn society to recover from conflict as well as to preventing future human rights abuses. Slovenia is a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court. We stress the importance of effective cooperation with the International Criminal Court, including by the Security Council, and we invite States that have not yet done so to ratify the Rome Statute.\nWe must preserve and protect the non-proliferation architecture, basedonthe Treatyonthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in order to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We must implement all binding international treaties concerning weapons of mass destruction, particularly the NPT, whose fiftieth anniversary we are celebrating this year.\nSlovenia supports resolving our pressing proliferation issues by diplomatic and peaceful means. To that end, we reiterate our support for the Iran nuclear deal, as long as Iran honours its obligations. We welcome the recent developments relating to the Korean peninsula and hope to see its  complete,  verifiable  and irreversible denuclearization. Slovenia continues to support humanitarian demining, mine-victim assistance and the elimination of unexploded ordnance and remnants of war.\nThe International Trust Fund Enhancing Human Security (ITF), a humanitarian  and non-profit organization, was established two decades  ago  by  the Slovenian Government, and its many activities around the globe \u2014 from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Afghanistan and Colombia \u2014 are concrete reflections of that support. We are grateful to the many States that cooperate and support the demining work of the ITF.\nSlovenia considers international development cooperation an important element of our overall international endeavours. Through it we support efforts in partner countries to eradicate hunger, protect the environment and contribute to overall sustainable development. Through its efforts in the Western Balkans, the European neighbourhood and sub-Saharan Africa, Slovenia is directly contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nSlovenia has also taken up the task of implementing the 2030 Agenda at the national level and is trying to contribute to its implementation at the global level with a sense of urgency. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are, in our view, two documents that together\nprovide a clear path and vision for a more sustainable future for our planet and prosperity  for  its  people. By the way, Slovenia ranks eighth out of at least 150 countries in realizing the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, something I am very proud of.\nToday more than ever before, we need a strong multilateral system in which the  emphasis must  be  on acting more collectively, rapidly and effectively. I would like to conclude by assuring the Assembly that Slovenia is committed to supporting the United Nations and determined to work with all partners to deliver tangible and meaningful results that will advance peace, security, development and human rights for all.\n"

        "file_text": "Jerusalem is not for sale and the rights of the Palestinian people are not for bargaining. Peace be upon the General Assembly. We will keep our faith in peace, we will maintain peace, and we will achieve our independent State with peace, because God is with us, our cause is just, our people have sacrificed a great deal and Assembly members are supporters of peace. God Almighty is against those who are unjust. Allah will suffice me, and He is the best guardian.\nDuring last year\u2019s general debate, I came before the Assembly (see A/72/PV.8) appealing for freedom, independence and justice for my oppressed people, who have been suffering under the yoke of Israeli occupation for 51 years. I return to the Assembly today, as that colonial occupation  continues  to  suffocate  us, undermining our unwavering efforts to build the institutions of our cherished State, which the General Assembly recognized in the year 2011.\nThis year the Palestinian National Council,  which is the Parliament of Palestine, convened and renewed the legitimacy of our national institutions through the election of a new leadership for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),  the sole  and legitimate representative of the Palestinian  people. The Parliament took important decisions that\ncommitted me to reconsidering the political, economic and security agreements that have been reached with the Israeli Government, and to reviewing the future  of the Palestinian National Authority, which has, unfortunately, been rendered powerless. In addition, the Parliament asked me to suspend the Palestinian recognition of the State of Israel until Israel in turn recognizes the State of Palestine based on the 4 June 1967 borders. Moreover, it requested that I approach international courts, including the International Criminal Court, to have them investigate the Israeli Government\u2019s breaches of the treaties it has signed, and investigate the aggressions of the Israeli army and the terrorist practices of settlers against our people, our land and our holy sites. The Assembly will note that every single day, Israeli settlers, and even the Israeli army, desecrate our holy sites, in particular the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nLast July, Israel adopted a racist law that crossed every red line. It is called the Jewish nation-State law. It denies the connection of the Palestinian people to their historic homeland and dismisses their right to self- determination, their history and the United Nations resolutions relevant to the Palestinian question. It also denies the agreements concluded with Israel, which will inevitably lead to the creation of a single racist, apartheid State, thereby nullifying the possibility of a two-State solution. Israel practices racism but has now crowned its practice with that new law.\nThe new law also discriminates against Arab citizens of Israel, granting the right to self-determination in the State of Israel exclusively to Jews and thereby legalizing discrimination against the Arab citizens, who make up 20 per cent of the population of Israel. In addition, the law discriminates against other non-Jews who have immigrated into Israel, stripping them of their citizenship rights. At least 5 per cent of Israel\u2019s current population are non-Jews, mostly Christian and Muslim immigrants, many of whom emigrated from the former Soviet Union. Those people have also been stripped of their rights to citizenship.\nThe new law constitutes a gross political and legal violation, as well as a real threat that reminds us  of the apartheid State that existed in South Africa. We therefore strongly reject and condemn it. We further call on the international community and the Assembly to take action to reject and condemn it as a racist and\n \nillegal law that is null and void, as the United Nations did when it condemned the former apartheid State of South Africa in several resolutions, bearing in mind that thousands of Jews and Israeli citizens have also rejected the new law and demonstrated against it. Fifty-six of the Knesset\u2019s 120 members have rejected it, because they deem it a law of racial discrimination. I therefore call on the United Nations to follow in the footsteps of those Israeli citizens who have rejected it.\nThat racist  law  talks  about  the  so-called  land of Israel. Could Assembly members ask the Israeli Government what exactly the land of Israel is? What are the borders of the State of Israel? I challenge anyone to give me an answer and bring me a map that shows Israel\u2019s borders. That racist law constitutes another stigma for the State of Israel and for anyone who keeps silent about it, as well as about other Israeli laws that legitimize piracy, the confiscation of land and the seizure of the funds of the Palestinian people.\nWe have always engaged positively with the various initiatives of the international community that seek to achieve peace between us and the Israelis, including the Arab Peace Initiative, which was recognized by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003).\nWe have also been dealing with the Administration of President Trump from the beginning of his tenure in the same positive spirit, and we welcomed his promise to launch a peace initiative. I have met with him on numerous occasions. While we eagerly awaited his peace initiative, we were shocked by the decisions and actions he took that completely contradict the role and commitment of his Administration to the peace process. In November 2017, his Administration made a decision to close the PLO office in Washington, D.C. He then announced his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved his country\u2019s Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He even boasts that he has taken the issues of Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and security off the negotiating table.\nAll such decisions threaten the Palestinian national cause and constitute a violation of international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions. The United States Administration went  even  further  in its aggression by cutting assistance to the Palestinian National Authority, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and Palestinian hospitals in occupied East\nJerusalem. Then they talk about humanitarian aid, and even that they have already stopped.\nWith all of those decisions, the Administration has reneged on previous United States commitments and undermined the possibility of a two-State solution, while revealing the falsity of its claims of concern about the humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian people. It is very ironic that the United States Administration still talks about what it calls the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d. What is there left for the Administration to offer the Palestinian people? Humanitarian solutions alone?  If it has removed Jerusalem, refugees, security and other issues from the negotiation table, what is left for a political solution in the Middle East?\nThe United States Congress continues to insist on viewing the PLO as a terrorist organization, although it is recognized as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people by the overwhelming majority of countries of the world, including Israel. However, the United States Congress continues to claim that the PLO is a terrorist organization, even though it is recognized by Israel, while the State of Palestine is cooperating with a majority of countries of the world, including the United States, to combat terrorism. Why is there then such animosity towards the Palestinian people, who are suffering under the yoke of an occupation that is supported by the United States?\nWe would like to tell that Administration that our position is firm and clear for all to see. We challenge them to find a single mistake that we have made during our long journey. However, the United States Congress says that the PLO is a terrorist organization. Why? I do not know. The Congress has decided and we must listen.\nFor years, we have  affirmed  to  the  United States Administration  our  willingness  to  establish  a Palestinian-American committee to examine the political and legal status of the PLO, as a means of demonstrating to the  Administration  that  the  PLO  is committed to achieving peace and combating terrorism, as well as showing that the decision of the Congress regarding the PLO is arbitrary, unlawful and unjustified, while the Congress deliberately ignores the official agreement between the PLO and the United States Administration on combating terrorism, an agreement that we have also concluded with 83 other countries. We have protocols with 83 countries under the  heading  of   combating  terrorism,  including  the\n \nUnited States. However, the United States Congress calls us terrorists.\nDespite all of that, I renew from this rostrum my call to President Trump to rescind his decisions and decrees regarding Jerusalem, refugees and settlements, which contravene international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions, as well as  the  understandings that we have reached aimed at salvaging the peace process and achieving security and stability for future generations. Incidentally, here is an example of those understandings. There is a letter signed by the United States Administration and ourselves concerning many issues, but the Administration now ignores all of them.\nConsistent with our commitment to peace and a two-State solution, and the negotiations that we never rejected leading to their achievement, I challenge anyone to cite a single instance in which we refused  to come to the negotiation table. On the contrary, we have been invited more than once by several countries in this very Hall to sit  down with the Israelis and  with Mr.  Netanyahu. Every  single  time, I  accepted.  I challenge anyone to tell me that I ever refused or  that he accepted even once. We have never refused those negotiations, because we want to rescue the peace process. I appeared before the Security Council on 20 February of this year (see S/PV.8183) and presented an initiative calling for the convening of an international peace conference based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and internationally endorsed terms of reference. Such a conference should involve broad international participation, including of regional and international stakeholders, led by the permanent members of the Security Council and the Quartet. We will circulate to Members a document laying out the initiative in its entirety and hope that the Assembly will adopt it.\nIn that regard, I reiterate that we are not at all against negotiations, and we have never once rejected them. We will continue to extend our hand to achieve peace. We believe in peace as the only path to reach our cause, as I said at the beginning of my statement. We do not believe in violence and terrorism. We miss no opportunity to reiterate that fact. What is required of us? Negotiations on the basis of international legitimacy? None of the international legitimacy resolutions since 1947 has been respected up to now, so what solutions are we talking about?\nPeace in our region cannot be realized without an independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital including all the holy sites. Some people try to outsmart us by asserting that our capital is in Abu Deis and other places  surrounding  Jerusalem.  That is a manipulation of words. No. Our capital is East Jerusalem, not \u201cin East Jerusalem\u201d. I would ask others not to try to outsmart us by saying \u201cAbu Deis\u201d or \u201cin East Jerusalem\u201d so that they can pick and choose an area here or there. No, it is East Jerusalem, which has been occupied since 1967, that is our capital.\nPeace is not possible otherwise, because there can be no peace in a State of temporary and unknown borders, like the State of Israel with its unknown borders. They invented the idea of a State with temporary borders and said: \u201cWe will give you a State but with unknown borders\u201d. Subsequently, they said, \u201cLet us talk\u201d. No, we unconditionally want a State with very well-defined borders and rights. Only then can  we  coexist  with the Israelis.\nThere are 138 States in the Assembly that have recognized the State  of  Palestine,  recently  joined  by Colombia. That makes 139.  I  therefore  call  on  the countries of the world that have yet to recognize the State of Palestine to make that long-overdue recognition happen. I can no longer see a convincing reason justifying the continued delay in the recognition of the State of Palestine by certain countries. In that regard, I want to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the fact that in 2019 the State of Palestine will chair the Group of 77 and China. Ten minutes ago, I met His Excellency President Al Sisi of Egypt in a conference room, and he announced that we have been freely elected by 134 countries to chair the Group of 77 and China. Nevertheless, there are certain countries that say, \u201cWe recognize both countries\u201d. If so, why do they not recognize Palestine? That is entirely unacceptable. We tell those countries that if they recognize us, it does not mean that we will not pursue negotiations. On the contrary, that will bolster our international standing, and, together with their support, we will be able to participate in negotiations assisted by their recognition of the State of Palestine. That recognition should not be unilateral in the sense of recognizing one State only, while refusing to recognize the other. They have to recognize both States.\nI would like to remind the Assembly once again that Israel has not implemented a single one of the hundreds of General Assembly resolutions on this topic.\n \nThe General Assembly has adopted 705 resolutions on the problem since 1947. And the Security Council has adopted 86 resolutions since 1948. Not a single resolution has been implemented by Israel. Unfortunately, I have to say frankly that Israel is supported in that by the United States. The General Assembly gave us 139 votes in favour, while 42 States abstained. Only eight countries voted against. For how long will Israel be an outlaw, do whatever it wishes and act as a rebel backed by whomever it wants?\nWe are resisting the Israeli occupation by legitimate means that have been recognized by the United Nations and include primarily peaceful popular resistance.  We will use no other means, only peaceful popular resistance. Is that illegal? By contrast, Israeli settlers are using weapons against the Palestinian people. They destroy cities, towns and villages with their weapons. I am not talking about the army and the police. I am talking about the Israeli settlers. We reject and will continue to reject violence and the use of force. We will reject every type of weapon and will not accept the use of arms anywhere. We call on the world to pursue efforts to achieve disarmament, including of both nuclear and traditional weapons.\nWe currently face a problem in Khan Al-Ahmar, where Israel is insistent on destroying a village that has been populated by Palestinians for more than 50 years. If Israel destroys that village, it will be  destroying  the unity of the West Bank, which will consequently be divided into north and south. That is what Israel wants to do. Does the Assembly agree with that? There is also the continued aggression against the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Does the Assembly remember the previous attacks on Al-Aqsa, which were stopped by peaceful popular resistance? We are now being told that the Israeli Supreme Court will approve a decision to divide Al-Aqsa by time and space. We will definitely not accept that, and I am sure that people with courage, dignity and a desire for peace will not accept it either. Israel should bear the brunt. Its senseless thuggery must come to an end. Every day there is a new decision taken as though we do not exist.\nA United Nations resolution (resolution ES- 10/20) was successfully adopted for our international protection, because every day we are being attacked, and we are not capable of protecting ourselves. That resolution  was  adopted,  but  who  will  implement it? In all honesty, it is not sufficient for the General Assembly to adopt a resolution without implementing\nit just like other resolutions. The General Assembly must respect its own resolutions. We applauded that resolution, but it is not being implemented. Please, tell us how we can implement that resolution. That is the Assembly\u2019s responsibility.\nWhile we welcome the economic and humanitarian support being provided through legitimate international institutions to our people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, we reject the notion that such support can be considered a substitute for a political settlement. Our cause has many humanitarian aspects, but with a political settlement, that humanitarian aid would not be needed. Do not try to fool us by saying that the Assembly is helping us.\nWe want the right to the self-determination of our people, no more, no less. Any people, large or small, should enjoy the right to self-determination. There are 13 million Palestinians around the world. Why are we being denied the right to self-determination? It would harm no one. We want to establish an independent State that will live alongside the State of Israel. What is wrong with that? What crime we would be committing?\nWe  are  facing  another  problem.  We  continue  to make genuine and serious efforts to put an end to the current division in our governance and achieve reconciliation despite the many obstacles preventing us from attaining those aims. To this day, we still uphold our responsibilities towards our people in the Gaza Strip.\nWe express our appreciation to our Arab brethren, particularly our brother Arab Republic of Egypt, for their efforts to end the division, hoping that those efforts will be successful. We entered into an agreement, with Egypt as a sponsor, on 12 October 2017. The agreement is very simple. The Palestinian Government will carry out its responsibilities, both in Gaza and in the West Bank, and then we will establish our State on a basis of unified law, authority, regime and legitimate arms. We reject the notion of militias. However, that agreement has not been accepted by the other party. Perhaps, over the coming days, we will witness a final round of talks before taking the next steps. I would like to sum up by saying the following.\nFirst, the Palestinian population numbers  about 13 million human beings, even if not everyone views them as human beings. We are not superfluous people. A population is never superfluous, regardless of its size. Why are we treated as a superfluous people that the\n \nworld should get rid of? That is totally unacceptable. Yet we are patient and steadfast, and we believe in peace and in peaceful means. We want to be viewed as humans. We are not superfluous.\nSecondly, we have entered into agreements with the United States Administration, which has, however, reneged on all those agreements. We  are committed  to and will abide by our part of the agreements, but if the United States Administration fails to honour them, then we will not abide by them either. So an agreement should be respected by all parties to it. I respect those agreements fully, but if the other side does not respect them, I will not respect them or be committed to them either. The United States wishes to act as a mediator, and yet we see now that the United States cannot single-handedly act as a mediator. We have the Middle East Quartet, which any country can join, whether from Europe, the Americas, Africa or even the Arab region. Any country may join the Quartet to act as a mediator between Palestine and Israel, but the United States cannot act as the sole mediator, because it is too biased towards Israel.\nThirdly, there are also agreements with Israel, such as the Oslo Accords and the Paris Agreement. Those agreements have all been abrogated by Israel, and we call on it to re-engage with them. If it does not, we  will certainly not uphold our commitments. We have also concluded an agreement with Hamas, and our brothers in Egypt recognize that we have upheld our side of the agreement. However, Hamas has failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why we will not bear any responsibility from now on for the failure of that agreement, if Hamas insists on rejecting it. I would like to be perfectly clear that we will not bear any responsibility while Hamas continues to refuse to abide by the agreement.\nDespite all the injustice we experience from the world, we will never resort to violence or terrorism. We will continue to combat violence and terrorism all over the world. We will never accept aggression against any country, whether that country recognizes us or not and whether it likes us or not.\nI would like to make a very important point. The United States Administration stated that the number  of Palestinian refugees is only 40,000. How was that number calculated? It need only consult UNRWA to see that the number it has calculated is wrong. It does not want to consult UNRWA; rather, it wants to obliterate\nit, so as to end the refugee issue forever. UNRWA was established in 1949 in order to help the Palestinian refugees until their issue is resolved. To this day, that issue has not been resolved. Of 13 million Palestinians, there are still 6 million refugees \u2014 not 40,000, as claimed by the United States Administration. That number has been arrived at haphazardly by the Administration, just the way it decided to abolish UNRWA and expected the world to agree with it. No, that will never happen.\nLastly, I call on our people to remain patient and steadfast and to continue to make sacrifices until we achieve independence and self-determination, with the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital, not merely \u201cin Jerusalem\u201d. Let them not fool us. I pay tribute to our righteous martyrs and our courageous prisoners. Israel considers them criminals. Why? Israel has thousands of people who have attacked all kinds of people and are considered heroes. Why is it that the person who killed Yitzhak Rabin is considered a hero, while our people are criminals?\nI send greetings to our heroic martyrs and prisoners. I would like to say to everyone that soon the dawn of freedom and independence will shine and the dark occupation will come to an end, God willing.\n"

        "file_name": "PER_73_2018.txt",
        "file_text": "At the outset, I want to welcome Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s,  who  is  assuming  the  presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, and to wish her a successful mandate. I am sure that her role will promote the multilateral system. She has Peru\u2019s support.\nI assumed the presidency of Peru just six months ago, when my country was facing a serious political and institutional crisis that we dealt with by ensuring full respect for the provisions of our political Constitution, which made it possible to restore the democratic stability that my country had been  longing  for.  A  few days after my term began, we had the honour of welcoming the leaders of 30 countries to the eighth Summit of the Americas, which resulted in the signing of the Lima Commitment to democratic governance against corruption. The agreement consists of 57 specific measures and actions to strengthen the fight against corruption and regional cooperation in that fight, including increasing transparency, accountability and political parties\u2019 use of banks in their election campaigns, as well as a call to the countries in our\n hemisphere to consider restricting access to public office for people convicted of corruption.\nWe are aware that corruption affects democratic governance and the rule of law. Nothing can be built on the basis of entities immersed in corruption. One of the first decisions that my Government took was therefore to establish an overall policy for the Government policy through 2021. Its main thrusts are integrity and the fight against corruption, as well as strengthening governance institutions. Within that framework, we have approved a 2018-2021 national plan for integrity and combating corruption. In addition, two months ago we submitted to the legislature a series of bills aimed at legal and political reform that also involve constitutional reforms, in which a few days ago our Congress expressed its confidence and its commitment to submitting for a referendum to be held on 9 December, involving the participation and decision-making of the entire citizenry through its vote.\nI am pleased to announce that Peru is making progress towards its long-awaited political reforms and justice-system reforms through constitutional and participatory mechanisms that honour our commitments made at the Summit of the Americas in Lima. We believe that only joint efforts by the State authorities, along with transparency, accountability and citizens\u2019 participation can enable us to build the country we deserve. In that context, I would like to announce that Peru will promote the adoption of a draft resolution within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and its Conference of States Parties, aimed at strengthening the cooperation needed to combat that scourge, especially large-scale corruption and its transnational reach. We also want to promote a decisive effort by the Assembly aimed at encouraging all States to renew their political commitment to fight corruption and to explore new and more effective ways of combating it. Every year corruption diverts 5 per cent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product to enrich the few rather than directing those resources to effectively meeting the Sustainable Development Goals for the benefit of those who need it most.\nWith regard to climate change, it is clear that Peru is one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries in terms of climate change. Our people\u2019s primary natural asset is our great biodiversity, and changes in temperature and extreme climatic events such as droughts and heavy rains therefore make us particularly vulnerable. As a country we have worked hard to create a legal\n \nframework that ensures predictability for investments with high environmental and social standards through a focus on production, protection and inclusion. In order to combat climate change, we have to overcome poverty. We need responsible investments to continue growing because the poorest of our people are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\nI had the privilege, in one of my Government\u2019s first actions, to see a climate change framework law enacted with the aim of reducing our vulnerability to climate change and taking advantage of opportunities for growth through low-emission development. Furthermore, we are one of the few countries that has an action plan for both gender and climate change, because women are the most vulnerable of all. I would also like to point out that we all have a moral obligation to protect our planet for future generations and guarantee our citizens the right to a healthy environment. That is both my personal belief and a State policy, so I can assure the Assembly that Peru will continue to promote action   at the national and international levels to effectively combat climate change.\nAs we work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which have already been incorporated into our national development plans, our primary responsibility is to achieve them with political determination and courage through the involvement of citizens and the private sector. We will also pay special attention to combating violence and discrimination against women. Our objective is to overcome the structural inequalities that women and girls suffer from in Peru, to guarantee their human rights and empower them to achieve their full development potential.\nIn an international context in which nationalist discourses promoting economic and commercial protectionism, discrimination and xenophobia are re-emerging, I believe it is necessary to reaffirm Peru\u2019s commitment to multilateralism and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As a member of the Security Council, Peru reaffirms its willingness to contribute to international peace and security, particularly through its active participation in peacekeeping operations. In that important body, we will continue to advocate for harmonious work based on international law and international humanitarian law. For a developing country like Peru, the United Nations represents a platform for shared action to achieve sustainable development, promote human rights\nand address global challenges such as climate change, terrorism, the proliferation of weapons, systematic corruption and illicit drug trafficking.\nI would like to express my country\u2019s commitment to free trade, which has enabled us to generate wealth, reduce poverty and make progress on sustainable development. We recognize the important role played by the World Trade Organization in ensuring the stability, predictability and transparency of the multilateral trading system. I invite every country to make the same commitment and to avoid protectionist measures, which, if implemented, will represent a setback both for developed countries and for those of us in the process of development.\nWith regard to democracy and human rights in  our region, I would like to reaffirm our democratic orientation, which led us to head the process that resulted in the adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter in 2001. The Charter reflects the commitment of the countries of the Americas to defending democracy, respecting human rights and upholding fundamental freedoms in the region. That commitment encourages us to seek ways to help to re-establish the democratic order where necessary. That is why Peru condemns  the breakdown of constitutional order in Venezuela. We will continue to promote initiatives to help restore democracy in our sister country within the framework of the Organization of American States, the Lima Group and in other multilateral forums. We reiterate our concern about and condemnation of the serious human rights violations in Venezuela denounced by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which among other violations have reported extrajudicial killings. Peru has also filed a complaint with the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court with a view to punishing those responsible for the crimes committed in Venezuela.\nMy country expresses its unwavering solidarity with the Venezuelan people and calls for an urgent response to the serious humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has led to a flood of migrants and refugees throughout our region. My Government has taken steps to help to regulate the influx of the more than 450,000 Venezuelan migrants who have come to Peru in search of a decent future. However, the scope of the exodus is unprecedented in our region and requires a collective response from the international community.\n \nI conclude by expressing our confidence in the potential of multilateralism,  international  law  and the principle of the  peaceful settlement  of  disputes in responding to the challenges before us, promoting sustainable peace and development and guaranteeing the human rights of  our citizens. Peru will continue  to work constructively within the framework of the Organization to achieve the goals of the founding Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the immense honour of addressing this historical and important General Assembly  for  the  first  time as the President of Colombia. I arrive both proud at having been elected with the highest number of votes in our electoral history and at being a member of a new generation of Colombians who are motivated to unite our country around common objectives.\nColombia is a magical country, where many races, regions, customs and ecosystems coexist. It is a nation where culture, ancestral heritage, nature and the industrious and helpful spirit of our citizens define the resilient vastness of a society that does not bend to any adversity. Our patriotic, industrious and tireless work force has made Colombia a people that has earned the respect of the world and attracted interest in investment, and one that is charting a path towards progress, with democratic institutions.\nWe have been able to maintain economic growth amid complex regional volatilities. We have seen  cities transform, a boost in production sectors and an expansion of the middle class while we adapted to the challenges of globalization. We have  made progress  in gender equality and in the worlds of work and education. In recognition of that progress, I named the first Cabinet with gender parity in the history of my country. But there is much to be done on that front, and we will continue to move forward. In proudly telling of that history, I commit myself as a Colombian and I am even more so as we move towards 2019, when we will celebrate the bicentennial of our independence.\nWe must be more motivated today than ever to achieve social justice,  reject  hatred,  polarization and revenge and concentrate on achieving a pact for Colombia \u2014 a pact for equity. That is the invitation  we are sending: that we build a development plan and agenda to define State policies in the coming decades, using the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 as a reference, within a framework of legality and entrepreneurship that bring us to the desired and necessary equity. I want that proposed agreement to be based in legality. Peace is an objective of all Colombians and all of us, absolutely everyone, will work decisively for it. However, peace needs to be built with the rule of law, which combines the public goods of security and justice.\nOur Government is going to work so that the process of demobilization, disarmament and reintegration\n \nput forward in the past few years will go forward successfully. We will offer those who have genuinely opted to rejoin the law and to be subject to the principles of truth, justice, reparation and non-repetition the right opportunities for progress and protection. I appreciate the support of the United Nations for its commitment to contributing to the success of  that  process.  For that reason, we have asked it to continue with those tasks. We will work in the same way to ensure that the resources and investments that give rise to hope reach all regions of the country, primarily those that have been hit by violence. The United Nations Mission in Colombia as well as our supervisory bodies know that our Government has gone through a fragile process on several fronts. The first is budgetary fragility: many commitments were made without allocating sufficient resources. The second is institutional fragility: a dispersed and complex architecture was created that has so far been unable to effectively make progress in the achievement of all the goals.\nHowever, I want to reiterate to the Assembly that Colombia\u2019s goal is to comply with our obligations to those who have genuinely left the path of violence behind. We hope to be able to count on the financial support of the entire international community to give the process the necessary strength. But just as we would comply with our obligations to those who abide by the rules, it is also our duty to apply the law in an exemplary manner when it comes to those who persist on the path of criminality. We will not accept a repeat of the violence. Those who continue in the world of crime and who seek to mock the victims and the generosity of the Colombian people will feel the full force of justice.\nIf we want peace to reign in Colombia, we must defeat drug trafficking. With regard to illicit  crops, we became aware of an alarming situation a few  weeks ago. The growing trend of the past five years cannot continue, since such seeds have fuelled and become the reason for the emergence of dangerous organized armed groups. That is why we are committed to dismantling those transnational criminal networks through a comprehensive approach.\nDrug trafficking is a global threat. It is true that we must do more in terms of prevention and care for addicts from a public health perspective. That is an indisputable truth. However, it is no less true  that drug trafficking in Colombia is a predator of the environment, a destroyer of institutions and, above all, a corrupter of society. It is our moral duty to combat\nthat phenomenon, while at the same time promoting a society that rejects drugs because of their devastating effects on health and society.\nWe are already taking steps. We welcome the fact that two days ago we supported the Global Call to Action on the World Drug Problem, acknowledging that it is the task of all and requires that all countries, including those where consumption is increasing as well as those that produce chemical precursors, contribute. Under the leadership of the United States, 130 nations committed themselves to continuing that fight. We will not give up or accept as fate the addiction that is destroying the souls of so many young people.\nLegality also means overcoming corruption. Corruption is a threat to democracy,  social  values and institutions and must be tackled with full resolve. From the first day of our Government, we presented measures to Congress, and then, in response to the popular clamour, we launched an ambitious and essential agenda together with all the parties. We showed the world that we are capable of uniting around national goals. I call on the international community to strengthen all sanctions tools and mechanisms to combat transnational corruption. Defeating corruption is a task that involves us all. We must do our utmost to expose those who are corrupt and to expedite their legal and social punishment.\nOur commitment to development, our pact for Colombia, also seeks to promote entrepreneurship  and economic recovery. The Sustainable Development Goals support our agenda for a Colombia where science and technology are driven by connectivity, access to capital, the development of the innovative economy and the promotion of research \u2014 a Colombia committed to protecting biodiversity, promoting renewable energy, reducing the individual carbon footprint and establishing a citizenship strengthened by steadfast ethics.\nThe world should know that that is the Colombia that we want to build every day. We will work to achieve that Colombia. That is our challenge and our motivation. For that reason, I must tell the world that those goals face a huge challenge.\nThat threat or challenge that our country is experiencing today is the thousands of fearful faces of those who are cold to the bone, with hunger in their stomachs and grief for their homeland. It is the challenge of people who, at this very moment, are walking in  the open and into the unknown on Colombia\u2019s roads.\n \nThey are our  Venezuelan  brothers  who  are  fleeing a dictatorship. Many of them are innocent children, unprotected and exposed to the tragedy of exile. While, over a period of six years, the conflict in Syria has led to an influx of 600,000 migrants a year to Turkey alone, in less than two years Colombia has opened its doors to almost 1 million of our Venezuelan brothers. We have received them with affection, and we will always  do so despite any social or financial obstacles, because brotherhood unites us.\nHowever, we must call a spade a spade. We are experiencing the most egregious migration crisis in the region\u2019s recent history on account of a dictatorship that denied freedoms. Today I would like to make it clear that the self-determination of peoples cannot be manipulated at the free will of the oppressors. The world must act and unite so that that tragic flight comes to an end and a people can see hope flourish.\nThat is a global challenge. The end of the dictatorship and the return to democracy and full freedom are the only viable way. That is why the international community must immediately demand the release of political prisoners, quickly identify the best solutions to the crisis and prevent such desolation and despair from continuing to increase.\nI ask that the United Nations hear our request. We are pleased that it listened to Colombia\u2019s request and that the Secretary-General appointed Eduardo Stein as Joint Special Representative for Venezuelan refugees and migrants, thereby elevatingthis debate. I also thank all the countries that joined us yesterday at the high-level meeting convened by Colombia, where the regional commitment to addressing that humanitarian crisis was clear. Such measures must be accompanied by the establishment of a multilateral  fund  to  care for the migrant population, which is a victim of that dictatorship. That is why we must promote the proposal announced by the Inter-American Development Bank and its President, Mr. Luis Alberto Moreno. However, it is equally important that all international mechanisms be implemented in order to ensure that those who caused that terrible tragedy are reported to, and investigated and punished by, the International Criminal Court.\nIt is an honour for me to address the Assembly, to set out the vision that we have for Colombia, to call  for global solidarity before the Venezuelan people and to issue them an invitation. Today  more  than ever,  the world needs cooperation and multilateralism. It\nis time to come together and not to isolate ourselves. It is time to make trade and cooperation the path of shared opportunities.\nWe must continue to move forward in a world where partnerships make it possible to mitigate the effects of climate change, strengthen fair trade, tackle corruption and transnational crime, create employment opportunities, put an end to discrimination and promote the idea of producing while conserving and conserving while producing.\nThe Colombia based on legality, entrepreneurship and equality that we wish to build is already under way. Moreover, we will not allow anything to snatch from us the hope of being a country that thinks big and that dreams of a better tomorrow and of working for the community of nations.\n"

        "file_text": "A veteran of United Nations diplomacy recently told me that every session of the General Assembly has its own crisis to discuss, its own major topic. So what is the big issue in 2018? Syria? North Korea? The Middle East? Or the dramatic global refugee situation, from the Mediterranean to Venezuela?\nIf we take a step back, those disparate conflicts reveal a bigger picture and a distinct pattern. It becomes clear that we are  indeed  facing  a  crisis \u2014  a  crisis of multilateralism. And that crisis makes conflicts around the world appear insoluble. When I say that they \u201cappear\u201d insoluble, that reflects the faith that we Germans have in multilateralism. Germany\u2019s post-war success story is also multilateralism\u2019s success story.\n \nEurope, which was scarred by war and destruction, was able to integrate in freedom, security and prosperity thanks to our neighbours\u2019 courage in seeking reconciliation. The United States also played  a crucial role in Europe\u2019s reconstruction. The fact that Europe was then able to become the closest partner of the United Nations is a triumph of multilateralism. We believe in the United Nations because international cooperation changed our own fate for the better.\nEurope has proved to the world that multilateralism and sovereignty are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, in a world faced with immense global problems, we can safeguard sovereignty only by working together.\nThree words, \u201cwe the  peoples\u201d,  express  both our goal and how we will achieve it. That is why the founders of the United Nations chose those as the opening words of the Charter of the United Nations. They wanted to spell out that we need to work together to find solutions. They wanted to leave no doubt as to whom the United Nations and we as representatives of States serve \u2014 the people.\nThe Charter\u2019s promises are addressed to the people, who are assured that their freedom and dignity will be defended at the United Nations in New York. But does a boy in Idlib, who lives in constant fear of the next air strike, feel that? How does a girl in Africa feel when her life expectancy at birth is 30 years lower than it would be if she were born in Germany? If we do not act on their behalf, \u201cwe the peoples\u201d will be nothing more than hollow words for them. Kofi Annan once said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more promises. We need to start keeping the promises we already made.\u201d (SG/SM/9095)\nWhen Germany  joins  the  Security  Council  as  a non-permanent member in a few weeks\u2019 time, that will be what motivates us. I thank the members of the Assembly for the immense trust they have shown in us through their votes. That trust is an incentive for us to play our part in tackling the world\u2019s crises, and to do so with courage and hope, but without overestimating ourselves. We want to work with all Member States as a reliable partner putting dialogue and cooperation at the heart of its action. In our view, \u201cwe the peoples\u201d refers in particular to those who find it hard to be heard at the United Nations. That means we will always seek dialogue with civil society, in the Security Council and beyond.\nNevertheless, \u201cwe the peoples\u201d also means that the Security Council itself must become more representative and inclusive. The world\u2019s population has more than tripled since 1945, while the number of States Members of the United Nations has almost quadrupled. Yet the Security Council has hardly changed at all. That is why we should stop beating around the bush and finally start real negotiations on Security Council reform, as the vast majority of Member States have wanted for a long time.\nThe crisis of multilateralism is most painfully evident in Syria. The civil war has long since turned into a widespread regional conflict, with further potential for escalation in an already ravaged part of the world. That sort of war cannot be resolved by military means, because the players in the region are too deeply involved and the individual stakes are too high. However, with united diplomatic efforts, we have managed to prevent escalation in Idlib, which is a glimmer of hope. The agreement between Turkey and Russia must now be permanently implemented. But ultimately, and at long last, we need a political process.\nTo that end, talks must be held under the auspices of the United Nations. In resolution 2254 (2015), the Security Council itself showed the way. We must finally take the path to free and fair elections. At that point, we will also be willing to shoulder responsibility for reconstruction. However, there is one line that we will not cross: we will not become accomplices to a regime that has forfeited its political legitimacy. Instead, we are doing our utmost to alleviate people\u2019s suffering.\nIt is shameful that financial support is running  out once again. As the second-largest humanitarian donor, Germany is willing to provide the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with a further \u20ac116 million \u2014 that is, half of the amount currently needed \u2014 to help Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon. But others also need to step up. After all, the Charter talks about \u201cwe the peoples\u201d.\nDisruptive foreign-policy approaches have now also reached the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many people are keen to make us believe that the notion of a negotiated two-State solution is obsolete. They want us to think that it is now merely a term used in diplomacy and can no longer be achieved. But whatever  way  they twist it, there will be lasting peace only if people can determine the course of their own lives, living in security and dignity on both sides of the 1967 lines.\n \nFor that very reason, it remains important to work for a negotiated two-State solution, 25 years after Oslo.\nThe conflict in Ukraine will also continue to compel our attention. Along with France, Russia and Ukraine, we are working hard to implement the Minsk agreements. The focus is on the measures agreed to a long time ago with a view to stabilizing the ceasefire. All efforts, including our discussions on a possible United Nations mission in eastern Ukraine, are aimed at achieving that end.\nLet us not forget  that  acute  crisis  management is at best a step towards peace. Lasting peace can be achieved only if we put a stop to the arms race. That is not some sort of nostalgic rhetoric from the days of the Cold War, whose balance of terror seems utterly benign compared to the scenario of a multipolar arms race with far more unpredictable players.\nIn the case of North Korea, the Security Council\u2019s united stance and sanctions helped to pave the way back to dialogue. That was important. However, North Korea must follow up its words with deeds, and that must lead to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. Germany is prepared to contribute its know-how, including the expertise we gained during the difficult negotiations with Iran.\nThe nuclear agreement with Iran may not be perfect. But so far, it has prevented Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and averted an escalation that was highly likely three years ago. That is not insignificant. We Europeans, together, therefore stand by the agreement. We are working on keeping economic exchange with Iran possible, and we call on Iran to continue to fully live up to its commitments. The fact that we stand by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action does not mean that we are turning a blind eye to Iran\u2019s destructive role in the region or to its ballistic-missile programme. That said, if there were no agreement, that would not make the search for solutions in Yemen, Syria or elsewhere any easier. On the contrary, disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation must generally become more of a focus of the work of the United Nations once again. We share the view of Secretary-General Guterres on this matter.\nOur shared rules must keep pace with technological developments. Otherwise, what currently sounds like science fiction may very soon become deadly reality, as exemplified by autonomous weapons systems, or killer robots that kill without any human control. I call\non Members to support, both here in New York and in Geneva, our initiative to ban fully autonomous weapons before it is too late.\nIt is not only  in that domain that prevention  is  the right answer. The United Nations of the twenty- first century must tackle the root causes of conflict, including climate change. Action based solely on nationalism, with each country seeking to put itself first, reaches its limits in that respect, not least because our climate knows no borders. The alarm bells have rarely sounded as loudly as they did in the summer of 2018 in almost all parts of the world.\nGermany and the European Union stand by the Paris Agreement. Moreover, we want to ensure that the Security Council makes the devastating effects that climate change can have on the security and stability of entire countries and regions an even greater priority.\nWe also need a quantum leap when it comes to post-conflict peacebuilding. That is why Germany will contribute at least \u20ac25 million to the Peacebuilding Fund this year. Over the past three years, Germany has tripled its contributions to efforts aimed at promoting stabilization and preventing crises around the world. For example, in Iraq, where Islamic State terrorists have mostly been militarily defeated, instead of leaving the Iraqi authorities to fend for themselves, we are training security forces to support administrative structures and providing civil support for efforts to promote stabilization, reconciliation and inclusive reconstruction.\nOnly when military measures are embedded in a clear political strategy can peacekeepers truly bring peace. That is also the objective of the peacekeeping reform efforts of Secretary-General Guterres. It would be a mistake to limit our discussion to bartering over decimal points in scales for  assessed  contributions. Of course efficiency is important, including for us in Europe, who are the largest contributors of funding. However, discussing potential cost savings alone  does not do justice to the benefits that peacekeeping missions bring, for example, in countries such as Mali or Lebanon, which have held peaceful elections and enjoyed relative stability, thanks in part to the Blue Helmets and the political efforts of the United Nations.\nWe Germans will continue to contribute, not only militarily and financially but also, always, politically, through diplomatic efforts and by investing in stability and  reconstruction.  After all,  the  success  of  United\n \nNations missions hinges on the political backing of Member States. That is particularly true for Libya right now. To tackle the Herculean task of making progress on functioning State structures, the United Nations needs our political support.\nPeace is more than guns falling silent. Only just societies, societies where men and women enjoy equal rights and where women participate in all societal decision-making, will remain peaceful in the long term. It is not only a matter of fairness and respect; it is simply a question of humanity and reason. Kofi Annan put it this way in his report entitled \u201cIn larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all\u201d:\n\u201cwe will not enjoy development without security, we will not enjoy security without development, and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights\u201d (A/59/2005, para. 17).\nSeventy years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that instrument\u2019s proclamation of dignity and personal freedom remains merely a distant promise for many. In the Security Council, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, we will demand accountability when human rights are trampled on, be it through human trafficking in Africa or attacks on the Rohingya in Myanmar. Nowhere will impunity stand. Even in war, there are limits.\nWe must hold to account those who wilfully attack humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and schools. Anyone who violates the most basic rules of human civilization must be punished. That also applies to those who use chemical weapons in breach of a taboo that was respected for decades. That is why it is so important that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been mandated to seek and identify those responsible. The perpetrators must be fully aware that there can be no impunity for crimes against humanity \u2014 never, and not anywhere. In that regard, the International Criminal Court remains indispensable because it sends a clear message to the victims and the perpetrators of the most serious crimes that justice will prevail.\nEarlier, I spoke about how we Germans in particular have faith when it comes to multilateralism. That faith is also based on the fact that the United Nations, time and again and despite all disagreements, delivers proof of what we can achieve by working together. I am thinking\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which remains our guiding set of principles for making this a better world for all people. I am also thinking about the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. The fact that more than 190 Member States \u2014 countries of origin, transit and destination \u2014 reached agreement on such complex and controversial issues is a victory for multilateralism. That success is an achievement of nations that are truly united.\nThe United Nations is built on our courage to reach compromises. The Organization grows with our desire to shape things. It thrives on our common pledge to act together first. Common ground is created when we put people at the heart of what we do. The desire for peace and security, and the dream of a prosperous and dignified life, are things that all people can relate to, whether they live in Baghdad, Berlin or Bamako. The United Nations belongs to the people. It is to them \u2014 the peoples of \u201cWe the peoples\u201d \u2014 that we owe allegiance.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to address the General Assembly at its seventy-third session on  behalf  of  His Excellency Mr. Dion\u00edsio da Costa Babo Soares, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor- Leste.\nFirst of all, allow me  to join  our voices  to those of previous speakers and present, on behalf of Timor- Leste, our deepest condolences to the people of Indonesia, particularly to the families of the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Sulawesi.\nI would like to start by congratulating Her Excellency Mrs. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on\n \nher election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session and also wish her success in this session under the theme: \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant for all people: global leadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. Taking into account the fact that this is only the fourth time in the history of the Organization that a woman is leading this important body, I believe that the President will also serve as an important role model for women and girls worldwide. I would like to assure her of Timor-Leste\u2019s support.\nI would also like to extend our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k for all his work towards achieving sustaining peace and preventing conflict. Timor-Leste also commends the manner in which the election of the seventy-third President  of the General Assembly took place under the leadership of President Laj\u010d\u00e1k, which provided an excellent precedent for future elections. We appreciate the theme chosen for this session and believe that it is most appropriate. The theme draws our attention to the need to unite peoples at a time when we are witnessing a gradual but unquestionable breakdown in the world order, which is leading to even more inequality and insecurity and further undermining faith in national and international institutions.\nAt a time when solidarity among peoples has assumed extreme importance in the global agenda, feelings of helplessness and impotence are evident, which divides peoples and provokes hostility. That is why the theme of this session is so important and appropriate because of its focus on inclusiveness, equality and global leadership. Timor-Leste is undoubtedly the leading example of the importance of an order based on international law. Next year, our country will celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the popular consultation organized by the United Nations, in which our people voted courageously for independence.\nWe cannot forget or fail to pay tribute to the then Secretary-General, our dear friend the late Kofi Annan. It was with deep sorrow and sadness that our people received the news of his death. As Secretary-General, Kofi Annan played a leading role in conducting the negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia, which culminated in the signing of the agreement of 5 May 1999, giving rise to the popular consultation in Timor- Leste. That is a significant milestone that we will also be commemorating next year.\nRecently, the United Nations again played a major role in Timor-Leste\u2019s future. For the first time, a Conciliation Commission, established in 2016 under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, succeeded in the positive resolution of a long-standing dispute between Timor-Leste and Australia about the definition of our maritime boundaries. That was a process that took about a year and a half and culminated in a new maritime boundary treaty, signed in this Hall on 6 March of this year, in the presence of Secretary- General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. The new treaty has enabled us to consolidate our national sovereignty and establish an important model for the peaceful resolution of international disputes. In a time of increasing global geopolitical tensions over maritime disputes, the success of the first conciliation process in history assumes an unprecedented international significance. Timor-Leste encourages other Member States to consider that mechanism for the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes. We believe that the mechanism will play an important role in appeasing global tensions on our seas.\nOur world faces many challenges, which can be effectively resolved through dialogue, cooperation  and on the basis of international law. One of the main challenges of our times is, without a doubt, climate change. That is an issue that Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has identified as the defining issue of our time. Timor-Leste is confident that the international community will act as one in responding to that existential threat to our planet.\nI take this opportunity to highlight the importance of active and extensive cooperation aimed at pursuing urgent and real action to deal with the threat facing small island developing States, including those in the Pacific region, which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\nI also would like to emphasize a fundamental issue that also requires the attention of the entire international community, namely, global migration.  Conflicts, wars, situations of inequality and climate change have resulted in an intense migratory movement throughout the world.\nTimor-Leste and the g7+ countries know that sustainable development cannot be achieved without peace. That is why we are aware of  the fact that the 17 Sustainable Development Goals will be unattainable if we are not able to build peaceful, just and inclusive\n \nsocieties. We hope that the assessment of the 2030 Agenda will take into consideration those concerns so that the fragile and vulnerable countries will not be left behind.\nTimor-Leste welcomes  the reforms  of  the United Nations system under the leadership of Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Following the implementation of the plan to enhance the role of the United Nations resident coordinators, Timor-Leste will contribute a modest amount over the next five years. We also support, without reservations, the reforms under the peace and security pillar. We commend the Secretary- General for his initiative on Action for Peace, including the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, which Timor-Leste has signed. In order to contribute to peace operations, Timor-Leste is currently investing in the training of its police and military personnel \u2014 with a special focus on strengthening the representation of women \u2014 in order to increase its capacity and possibilities for contributing in the near future to United Nations peace missions.\nHowever, despite our shared efforts aimed at strengthening peacekeeping missions,  we  continue  to see conflicts and war in the world, which fills us with concern. The ongoing war in Syria is a tragedy that is causing irreparable human damage and terrible suffering for the people living in that region. Timor- Leste urges the international community to do everything possible to put an end to that war and to stop the death and destruction in that country. The people of Western Sahara are still being denied their right to self-determination. We welcome the appointment of Mr. Horst K\u00f6hler as Personal Envoy of the Secretary- General for Western Sahara. We also appeal to the Kingdom of Morocco  and  the  Frente  Popular  para la Liberaci\u00f3n de  Saguia el-Hamra y  de  R\u00edo de  Oro  to establish a serious dialogue aimed at reaching a mutually beneficial political solution that will enable the people of Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-determination through a referendum organized by the United Nations.\nTimor-Leste urges the international community to redouble its efforts with the parties concerned aimed at reaching a just, peaceful and  lasting  solution  to the question of Palestine. We reaffirm Timor-Leste\u2019s support for the two-State solution and the urgent protection of the civilian population. Timor-Leste also remains concerned about the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba for more than\nsix decades, which has had a considerable impact on the lives of the people and the development of the country. Our region welcomes the continued dialogue for peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula, and we hope that the dialogue between the parties concerned will bring an end to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region.\nAllow me to take the opportunity to talk about the current situation in Timor-Leste. On 12 May, we held early legislative elections. The elections were held in a peaceful environment and resulted in a new Government led by His Excellency Mr. Taur Matan Ruak. After a period of economic stagnation owing to the political situation, my country is resuming its development and economic growth and is on the path towards normalcy. The socioeconomic foundations that we need in order to create a prosperous and united society have already been established. With the recent adoption of the general Government budget, we hope to continue to improve our social, communications and housing infrastructure and, in turn, develop opportunities for investment and economic development.\nAnother important step for Timor-Leste was the Government\u2019s decision to acquire 30 per cent of the capital in the consortium that operates the Greater Sunrise gas field in the Timor Sea, which gives  us  the possibility of connecting a pipeline to Timorese territory and accelerating the development of the southern coast. It was, once again, our historic leader and former President of the Republic and Prime Minister, His Excellency Mr. Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, who successfully conducted the negotiations.\nWe continue to have strong relations with our neighbours Indonesia and Australia. We are also deepening our  cooperation  with  the  countries  of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and we await patiently a decision on our request to accede to that organization. Timor-Leste remains committed to strengthening ties of friendship and cooperation with the countries of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and hopes that the Portuguese language, spoken by nearly 250 million people worldwide, will also become an official language of the United Nations.\nOur country has also signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and  we  encourage all Member States to do so. We live in a world that is different from that of the immediate post-Second World\n \nWar period, when the United Nations was  created. The current times are full of challenges, and we all need, more than ever, to be prepared to meet those challenges and our aspirations, as well as to defend the value of multilateralism. My country firmly believes in the United Nations and in the international system. As such, we are committed to working cooperatively towards international peace, security and prosperity for the well-being of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Twenty years ago, in this very Hall, Kofi Annan set out the three great challenges facing the international community at the time: first, the challenge of security and the need to replace the post-Cold War world order with a new one, governed by peace and freedom; secondly, the challenge of development and the need  to ensure that globalization benefited all peoples and countries, leaving no one behind; thirdly, the challenge of human rights and the rule of law, and the need to protect the dignity of all without distinction as to race, colour, gender, language or any other discriminatory factor (see A/53/PV.7).\nTwenty years have now gone by, and the challenges bequeathed to us by Kofi Annan \u2014 security, development and human rights \u2014 remain just as important and are still key challenges to our world order. These challenges, of course, come under new guises and take on various forms. We are no longer divided by the mistrust, fear and prejudice that were the legacy of the walls and iron curtains that emerged in the wake of the Second World War. The truth is that many factors unite us in terms of human dignity and freedoms, and we are connected by a knowledge- and information-based society that has enabled those who embrace it to reap the benefits but is indifferent and cruel to those who turn their back to it. We are living at a time of vast global transformation, which means the emergence of tremendous new opportunities as well as major new dangers.\nSome believed that the end of the Cold War also meant the end of history, and that we had at last found our way and were approaching an era of peace, freedom and prosperity, based on democracy and the social\nmarket economy. However, history will never meet its end as long as there are still free men and women who think for themselves. Accordingly, a new world order has emerged that has given rise to new divisions and tensions in many parts of the world. States are no longer the only main players in international relations.\nIn the area of security, we have not yet been able  to overcome serious threats to international  peace  and security such as terrorism, drug trafficking, armed conflict, organized crime, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and illicit trafficking in weapons and persons. Furthermore, as never before, today we are compelled to face one of the biggest challenges resulting from these threats to international peace and security \u2014 large-scale migration around  the world, which is a significant challenge for the entire international community. We are aware of its causes \u2014 terrorism, war, ethnic and religious conflict, hunger and totalitarian regimes, all of which have recently caused the largest displacement of people in the history of humankind. The figures are stark and speak for themselves. There are currently 260 million people who have had to leave their countries of origin. Every year more than 1.3 million people abandon their countries for the reasons I have mentioned.\nIn the light of that situation, Chile\u2019s commitment is categorical and clear. We are designing a safe, orderly and regular migration policy, in line with the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants and the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which raise the need to establish migration policies that guarantee safe, orderly and regular migration. We want to receive and welcome all who enter Chile seeking new and better lives, who do so with the intention of obeying our laws, committing to the development of our country and to integrating into our society. With equal strength and conviction, however, we want to keep  order  in our country and bar those who enter illegally, break our laws, come to commit crimes or have committed serious crimes in their countries of origin. By doing so we can prevent and impede the entry of drug traffickers and people involved in organized crime, because all Presidents and Heads of State and Government are responsible for their citizens\u2019 safety, which is of course a key concern for any Government.\nOur migration policy seeks to strike a balance between the State\u2019s sovereign right to regulate the manner in which migrants enter and remain in our country, on the one hand, and its duty to respect\n \nand guarantee the fundamental rights and duties of migrants, on the other, by putting a stop to irregular immigration, punishing criminal acts and welcoming those who come to integrate legally into our societies in accordance with the law.\nThe second great challenge is development. Six months ago, when I  embarked  on  my  second  term as President of Chile, I pledged to undertake a great mission \u2014 transforming Chile into a developed country without poverty and with greater equality of opportunity and solidarity by the end of the next decade. Genuine development is much more than economic growth. We are therefore talking about comprehensive development that encompasses all aspects of our lives, an inclusive development that reaches all families, individuals and regions, and a sustainable development that protects and is in aligned with nature and the environment. That is the genuine development that all peoples and countries need and that we almost all ratified through our previous commitment to the Millennium Development Goals and now through the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development, to which we are committed under the auspices of the United Nations.\nFor that reason, the importance of defending and strengthening multilateralism and free trade, to which many have alluded this week, is now severely under threats from such things as trade and tariff wars, the consequences of which we felt as long ago as the Great Depression of the previous century. The economic dimension is, of course, very important. More than ever, we need to promote and bolster an international system that is predictable and based on clear and agreed standards, fosters free trade and enables mechanisms for settling disputes peacefully rather than through conflict, confrontation or tariff wars.\nHowever, we must also think about creating a culture and an international community that are built on the principles and values of freedom, human dignity, full respect for human rights, gender equality and the fight against climate change and other new emerging threats, such as those related to cyberspace.\nSuch comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable development compels us to implement robust measures aimed at ensuring full equality in terms of rights, dignity and opportunities for both women  and  men, as well as a culture of zero tolerance for violence or discrimination against women. Our true development\ncan be measured by the way in which we treat our societies\u2019 most vulnerable members, such as children, women, elderly people, those suffering from disease and the poorest. In many of  those  areas,  many  of our countries still have a long way to go.\nToday our planet faces major threats and challenges, such as a deteriorating environment, global warming, growing desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, the depletion of natural resources, the loss of biodiversity, as well as air, water and soil pollution and deforestation, to name just a few.\nSome time ago, major and well-regarded magazines published photographs of the Earth with the caption \u201cSave planet Earth\u201d. But  that should not  be our greatest concern. Planet Earth has existed for more than 4 billion years and has survived all kinds  of catastrophes \u2014 flooding, glaciation, warming and earthquakes. What is actually at risk is the survival of the human race on planet Earth. During its long history, 99 out of every 100 species that have ever existed have now disappeared. Naturally, we do not want to add human beings to that sad list of extinct species.\nWe know that the environment is changing and that global warming is occurring faster than our efforts to understand, halt and stop it. The alarm bells continue to sound and our citizens continue to march, and we cannot claim to be ignorant about it. We have  a  duty to respond immediately to nature\u2019s desperate cries for protection, so that in turn it can protect us. There is  no time to lose and no reason to procrastinate about this, because time is no longer our ally. It is our enemy. Our generation\u2019s response to this great challenge will undoubtedly be judged by our children, grandchildren and other generations to come. The threat of climate change and the way we address it will define this and future centuries and requires a vast multilateral effort. We are aware that we are dealing with a truly serious, urgent and growing threat that we can no longer ignore, delay or downplay.\nNo nation is immune  to  that  threat,  but  Chile  is especially vulnerable. My country is a veritable observatory and natural laboratory, as it contains very diverse land, maritime, coastal and glacial ecosystems, among many others, as well as unique island ecosystems that are home to more than 30,000 species of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. In addition, Chile is geographically unique because of its natural barriers, the Andes range to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the\n \nwest, the Atacama desert to the north and the Antarctic to the south, which means that we are home to species found nowhere else in the world. For example, almost 90 per cent of fish species \u2014 the highest percentage  in the world \u2014 on Robinson Crusoe Island in the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez archipelago are endemic; in other words, they are unique to that environment.\nHowever, that virtue is also our Achilles heel. Chile, as a natural observatory, is greatly exposed to the risks and threats of climate change  and  global  warming. In fact, seven of the nine major vulnerability factors listed in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change apply to Chile \u2014 low-lying coastal areas, arid and semi-arid areas, large forested areas, areas prone to natural disasters, areas prone to drought and desertification, urban areas with atmospheric pollution problems, and mountainous ecosystems.\nThat compels us to seek urgent and effective solutions in order to adapt to and address the threat of global warming. As President of Chile, I am especially committed to sustainable development, in other words, environmentally friendly development that respects nature. A threat that was once remote is  now  upon  us, and we are currently witnessing the lethal impact of those changes and their possible future impact on present and future generations. There is no time to lose. We must take the bull by the horns and do whatever is necessary to change the course of history.\nWhat has Chile done in that regard? First, we are committed to creating protected areas that preserve crucial biodiversity. Chile has been a regional and world leader in creating protected areas since the beginning of the last century, starting with the Malleco National Reserve. Today, there are 180 marine and land-protected areas in Chile covering more than 120 million hectares.\nWe are also firmly committed to conserving our oceans, their biodiversity and the sustainable use of their resources. We  have  already protected more than\n13 per cent of our exclusive economic zone, which stretches along Chile\u2019s approximately 4,200 kilometres of coastline. And we are on our way to achieving 40 per cent protection, with the largest marine protected area in Latin America, one of the largest in the world, on wondrous Easter Island, or Rapa Nui.\nIn addition, the energy path that we are following towards a cleaner, safer, more cost-effective and more diversified energy matrix that strongly promotes decarbonization has enabled us to make significant\nheadway in developing clean, renewable energy, particularly volcanic energy \u2014 Chile has 25 per cent of the world\u2019s active volcanoes \u2014 as well as wind and solar energy, since Chile is home to a desert with the highest solar radiation levels in the world. We are also making great advances in removing fossil fuels from our transport system and moving towards electromobility, with a more definitive solution that is more compatible with those objectives.\nMoreover, we are addressing the threat to our planet posed by plastic. We understand how important it is for all Governments to act in time to prevent 12 billion tons \u2014 a figure we have almost reached \u2014 of plastic waste from ending up in natural environments, meaning that there would be more plastic bags than fish in our oceans. I am very happy that the first piece of legislation to be adopted during my current term in office has banned the use of plastic bags in Chilean shops. Chile is the first country in Latin America to restrict the free distribution of any kind of single-use plastic bag. The fact is that one plastic bag takes seconds to produce and is used, on average, for 15 minutes on the journey back from the supermarket, but then takes 400 years to biodegrade, which means that for a few minutes of use, nature and humankind must suffer the harmful effects of one plastic bag for more than 400 years.\nOnce and for all, we must address many of those problems with a new attitude and abandon the idea that the goals of economic growth and the protection of the environment are incompatible. The fact is that if growth is unsustainable, it will simply cease to exist. We must also abandon our throwaway culture and return to embracing one of recycling.\nPollution has struck very dramatically and close to home in my country, Chile. Over the past few weeks, the two communes of Puchuncav\u00ed and Quintero, which have long been overpolluted, experienced serious episodes of environmental pollution, affecting the health of many citizens. In view of the seriousness of the situation, I immediately visited the areas concerned to meet with the authorities and the communities and to see and experience, with my own eyes and senses, the dramatic effects of that environmental disaster. During my visit, I made a promise to Chilean citizens to rewrite the future for those two communities and many others. To that end, we are  implementing  a plan to resolve the emergency situation and protect  our citizens\u2019 health. We are also developing a long- term solution to enable us to better protect the quality\n \nand health of our water, air and soil through ongoing monitoring with the highest available technological standards and the implementation of extraordinary emission standards for polluting companies, as  well  as a comprehensive pollution plan that will enable us to permanently resolve such situations and achieve a definitive solution, putting an end to the so-called sacrificial zones in our country.\nWe know that nature is not a gift inherited from our parents, and that we therefore cannot use it as we like. Rather, it is a loan from our children, grandchildren and future generations. We must nurture it and return it to them in better condition. That challenge must involve all stakeholders in society. Channelling collective and multisectoral efforts requires the commitment of us all. That is the aim of the framework law on climate change that we are implementing in Chile and that by 2030 will enable us to reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent compared to the base year.\nTo do it, we must incorporate the climate-change perspective into all public policy and private-sector commitments. We are doing just that by incorporating environmental and climate-change policies into our national investment system and our evaluation systems for public  expenditure  and  environmental  impact. In addition, we are including those concerns and commitments in both bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which unites 11 countries on both shores of the vast Pacific Ocean, as well as in the ways in which we are addressing the process of adding new members to the Pacific Alliance.\nWithout doubt, those developments have reduced our carbon emissions and will continue to significantly reduce them while strengthening our economy. The challenge is extremely demanding and requires great determination and ambition. In that regard, we have two important allies, the first of which is technology. Today, the scientific imagination and innovation and the scientific and technological advances that have emerged from the freedom and creativity  of  free men and women have equipped us with new tools to combat this relatively new and serious threat..We must therefore continue to boost and foster our technology and scientific entrepreneurs so that they will join this fight and not repeat the errors of the past. In recent days we learned of an initiative that can clean the rubbish and plastic out of our oceans more efficiently. In our efforts\nto fulfil our commitments, those are the technologies that we are using in my country.\nMoreover, we have a multilateral system that enables us to act in a coordinated manner. That is precisely the point of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, we are aware that bureaucracy often slows down United Nations efforts. We must therefore improve coordination and be able to generate more delivery and accountability, while also focusing more on the results and less on the process. As a great United States President once remarked, our generation is in a unique twofold situation. We are the first generation  to feel the impact of climate change and also the last generation that can do something about it.\nI shall now turn to human rights \u2014 the third challenge raised by the late  Kofi  Annan  20  years ago in this Hall \u2014 and the challenge of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Five years ago, from this very rostrum (see A/68/PV.5), I was able to share the lessons and teachings of Chileans 40 years after the collapse of democracy in our country, and after its subsequent recovery. The lessons we have learned have specific relevance.\nThe first and most important lesson is that there are always moral and legal norms that should be respected by everyone: combatants and non-combatants, civilians and soldiers, leaders and subordinates, with the result that atrocity crimes such as torture, crimes against humanity, terrorism, political assassination and forced disappearances can never be justified in any context, time, place or circumstance. Freedom, democracy, peace and civic friendship are much more fragile than we tend to think, which means that we must never take them for granted. They must always be valued, taught, fostered and protected, because they are like air. When we have it, we take it for granted, but when we do not, it is often too late to get it back.\nIn Chile we are now a few days away from marking\n30 years since the referendum of  5  October  1988  that paved the way for us to regain our freedom and democracy. I would like to take this opportunity to recall the two major transitions that our generation has had to face in Chile. The first of them enabled us to regain our freedom and democracy, which we achieved in an intelligent and exemplary manner. Normally such transitions take place amid political crisis, economic chaos and social violence, none of  which happened in\n \nour country. We were able to restore our freedom and democracy in an admirable manner.\nHowever, that transition is now history. The new transition, our transition, that is currently under way and depends on us consists in transforming Chile, once the poorest of Spain\u2019s Latin American colonies, into a developed country, without poverty and with greater social justice and equal opportunities, in which we can all develop our talents and life plans and live fuller and happier lives, by the end of the next decade. We must complete that transition with the same unity, generosity and intelligence with which we carried out the transition that allowed us to regain our democracy.\nOn human rights, I want to clearly and strongly state today that human rights, freedom and democracy know no borders. I would  therefore like to bring to the General Assembly the voice of the Venezuelan people, which President Maduro\u2019s regime has silenced. Venezuela is a sister nation that for many long decades was a democracy that brought great progress and well- being to its people, generously opening its borders to many Latin Americans so that they could find shelter, work and opportunity there that were not available in their own countries.\nUnfortunately, today  Venezuela  is  governed  by a regime that respects none of its principles, neither freedom nor democracy nor human rights. It is a society that is being torn apart by a moral, political, social and humanitarian crisis \u2014 a  moral  crisis,  because the basic values of human rights are not respected; a political crisis, because there is no democracy, rule of law, separation of powers or freedom of expression, and there are hundreds of political prisoners; and an economic crisis, because Venezuela, once the richest country in Latin America, now has less than half the production capacity it had in its heyday.\nIndeed, Venezuela is undergoing a tragedy. Its inhabitants are fleeing from a dismal and perilous existence. Many, too many, are literally losing their lives for lack of food and medicine. President Maduro, while denying the situation, is not letting in the humanitarian aid that many countries are willing to deliver. In recent years, more  than  2  million  Venezuelans  have  had to leave their country as a result of the crisis I have  just outlined. I ask myself how a President can be so ambitious and callous that he is willing to cause his own people such pain and suffering in order to prevail and cling to power.\nHowever, Venezuela is not the only country in that situation. The same is  happening in countries such  as Nicaragua, in which more than 400 people have already died as a result of the violence fostered by the State and President Ortega\u2019s Government. In fact, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which has reported assassinations, extrajudicial executions, ill-treatment, torture and arbitrary detentions in that country, was expelled from Nicaragua a month ago. There are also  similar occurrences in Cuba, where for more than 60 years there has been no freedom, democracy or basic respect for human rights, as evidenced by its arbitrary detentions and, as in Venezuela and Nicaragua, its censorship of freedom of expression, which is guaranteed under article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\nChile does not recognize the legitimacy of the recent presidential elections in Venezuela, because they did not fulfil the basic requirements necessary for free, democratic and transparent elections, in accordance with international standards. We will therefore not recognize the legitimacy of the new Government that emerged from the election. Chile will continue to do all it can, in accordance with international law, to help the Venezuelan people to regain their freedom, democracy and human rights and emerge from the sad and tragic disaster affecting the country.\nFor that to happen, we need the support of the multilateral system, in particular the United Nations. We believe that the Organization, through  the Security Council, should address the democratic and humanitarian crises affecting those countries. As I have said before, in modern times, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights do not and should not recognize borders. Chile will therefore use all the mechanisms available under international law and work with all its strength and commitment to restore freedom, democracy and human rights in those countries.\nI would like to end my statement with a reflection on the current state of the United Nations and the reforms and updates that many countries think the United Nations now urgently requires. The United Nations, which has contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security on countless occasions as the cornerstone of multilateralism, today has highly restricted and limited powers. We have lost the ability to prevent crises and to strengthen the institutions of Member States with the aim of generating a true culture of democratic resilience that is capable of surviving\n \nbreakdowns, like those suffered in some countries in our region. We therefore believe that the time has come for the United Nations to modernize, as has been suggested by many Member States on various occasions, in order to be able to act more quickly and effectively in the face of the challenges of the modern age.\nThe structure of the United Nations, and especially its Security Council, is a legacy of the victors in the Second World War, which ended more than 70 years ago, and it does not meet the needs and challenges of current times. In fact, we all know that some permanent members of the Security Council exercise or threaten to use their right to veto for reasons that are based more on their own interests or those of their allies than on their duty to preserve peace and security in every corner of our planet.\nThat behaviour has reduced and continues to reduce the effectiveness of a fundamental organ of the United Nations that not only holds enormous power but also has a tremendous responsibility, that of preserving peace and security on our planet. In addition, the current composition of the Security Council does not reflect today\u2019s world and does not adequately represent entire continents, such as Africa or Latin America, or countries such as Germany, India and Japan.\nI would therefore like to conclude by emphasizing that it is not only development that should be sustainable, but also peace. It is precisely at times like these that the values we share as an international community should guide and illuminate our actions and the path ahead. People must not be united by free trade alone. What should guide us is the maintenance of peace and security and respect for the basic values that led to the formation of the Organization, and it is therefore those same values that must illuminate and guide the path to its future.\nOnly by strongly and coherently reviving those values will the United Nations be able to fulfil its responsibilities and rise to the challenges of the new world we live in. Together with the formidable threats that we are confronted with, such as terrorism, global warming and mass migration, we also have magnificent opportunities that are generated by the freedom, imagination and unlimited creativity of the free men and women of this world.\n"

        "file_text": "I  congratulate  Her  Excellency Ms. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s on her assumption of her presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. I assure her that the Tonga delegation will fully support her able leadership. I express our gratitude to her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, for his successful and able leadership of the Assembly at its seventy-second session, in particular for making the work of the Assembly people-centred and striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet.\n \nI also commend His Excellency Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for his ongoing stewardship of the Secretariat. Tonga fully supports the ongoing  work  he  is  undertaking on reform, including the all-important review of the United Nations multi-country offices in the Pacific Islands region.\nMy delegation and I also wish to congratulate the President also on the chosen theme, which is both timely and relevant. \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d aptly reflects who we are as a collective in ensuring the work of the United Nations has meaning to those that matter most \u2014 our peoples. We welcome this theme as the guiding principle for our work during this session.\nIn contributing towards the implementation  of the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable  Development  and its Sustainable Development Goals, including the internationally agreed blueprint for the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS), the Samoa Pathway, Tonga has made both agreements an integral part of its national planning  processes. The Government\u2019s priority agenda from 2018 to 2021 aligns with 13 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, namely, Goals, 1 through 4, 6 through 9 and 13\nthrough 17.\nThe High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development remains an important means, which Tonga endorses for the follow-up, monitoring and accountability of commitment by Member States through voluntary national reviews, which are linked to the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Tonga looks forward to presenting its first voluntary national report  to  the  High-level  Political  Forum  in 2019.\nThe High-level Political Forum will also dedicate a day at its high-level ministerial segment to the mid-term review of the Samoa Pathway in 2019. Tonga was pleased to host the Pacific regional preparatory meeting for the mid-term review of the Samoa Pathway in June, the outcome report of which forms the latest iteration of the Pacific region\u2019s sustainable development aspirations. Tonga looks forward to engaging with other SIDS and partners in Samoa at the end of next month to produce the final interregional report for the midterm review of the Samoa Pathway for consideration at the High-level Political Forum next year.\nIn that regard, we recognize the important contribution of the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific Subregional Office for the Pacific.\nTonga welcomes the convening of the third high- level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) tomorrow. Combating  the  threat  that  NCDs  poses to individuals, families and communities has been recognized as grossly underfunded given its magnitude.\nWe in Tonga are pleased to inform the Assembly of commendable reductions in the prevalence of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Tongan people are eating healthier food and involved more in physical activities. We are, however, not without  challenges, for example, as shown in rising obesity rates. The Tongan Government is addressing the issue by making unhealthy food choices more expensive and healthier food choices cheaper for the Tongan public.\nClimate change continues to pose significant security threats to us as island States. In Nauru earlier this month, Pacific leaders endorsed an expanded concept of security in their communiqu\u00e9 and the Boe Declaration, linking, inter alia, climate change and threats to international peace and security. In that regard, Tonga welcomes the establishment of the Group of Friends on Climate and Security to further highlight the nexus between the threats of climate change with threats to international peace and security.\nWe note with concern the devastating impacts of climate change on our marine environment. Baselines that determine our territorial boundaries, once established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, should not be affected and should remain unchanged, despite the effects of sea-level rise. Our sovereignty must not be compromised by climate change. We welcome the work of the International Law Commission on this critically important and timely issue for consideration by the Sixth Committee.\nTonga looks forward to taking our important work forward at the twenty-fourth session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change under the leadership of Poland in December. We seek to strongly address the adverse impacts of climate\n \nchange and the urgent need for innovation in adaptation for SIDS.\nTonga engaged in this year\u2019s first intergovernmental conference on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in the high seas and the seabed. We are hopeful that a gradual convergence of views will result in a zero-draft of a legally binding instrument for consideration at the second and third meetings of the intergovernmental conference, to be held in March and August 2019, respectively.\nTonga  has  also  continued  its  engagement  at  the International Seabed Authority in ensuring the appropriate management of the resources of the area. Tonga is grateful to the members of the Authority for its re-election this year to the Council, and we look forward to working together on the development of the important draft exploitation regulations. Tonga also looks forward to hosting the first regional International Seabed Authority workshop, in early 2019, to explore the benefits of seabed mining to the blue economy of Pacific Islands and to progressing development of a regional treaty on deep sea mining.\nWe would like to acknowledge Italy\u2019s ongoing partnership with Tonga through the joint  committee in strengthening Tonga\u2019s capacity in the field of the environment and the ocean. We also acknowledge the work of the secretariat of the Pacific Community, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Pew Charitable Trust on the regional treaty.\nTonga commissioned its first independent power producer-owned solar farm last year and strongly believes that it can achieve its 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2020 through more and stronger public- private partnership arrangements. Tonga wishes to acknowledge the partnership it has established with the Government of Austria, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the Pacific Community to establish the Pacific Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, a specialized regional  entity to support private-sector investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency in the Pacific islands. We would also like to recognize and acknowledge the announcement made by the Government of Norway of its commitment to provide $2 million in support of the important work of the Centre.\nFinally, sustainable development \u2014  whether  it be, inter alia, through good health and well-being, climate action, life below water or affordable and clean\nenergy \u2014 can be realized only through international peace and security. We continue to look to the Security Council to protect the innocent from threats to international peace and security in any form, be they traditional threats such as armed conflict or newer threats such as climate change, to ensure that no one is left behind.\nMay Almighty God guide and bless the President of the General Assembly, all the States Members of the United Nations and their respective Governments and peoples.\n"

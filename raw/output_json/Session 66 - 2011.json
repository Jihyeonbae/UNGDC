        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino, I wish to \ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. His long experience as Ambassador \nof Qatar to the United Nations and his deep knowledge \nof this Organization will be valuable resources in \nhelping us move ahead with the reforms needed in the \nmost important areas of United Nations activity. Over \nthe past few years, Qatar has played a significant \nmediation role in the Arab world. The delegation of \nSan Marino will cooperate fully in the work to be done. \n I also wish to sincerely thank the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his energy and \npraiseworthy efforts, for the interest he constantly \ndisplays in all United Nations Member States, and for \nhis constant and crucial presence in every politically \nimportant situation and emergency worldwide. His \nreappointment to a second term is important to \npromoting reform of the United Nations, guaranteeing \nthe Organization\u2019s full effectiveness and preventing \nany action aimed at decentralizing global governance. \n I take this opportunity to express my sincere \ngratitude for the excellent work done by the United \nNations, under the careful and effective leadership of \nthe Secretary-General, in South Sudan. By putting an \nend to the violence and atrocities that have plagued \nthat part of Africa for several years, the United Nations \naction led to the Republic of South Sudan\u2019s declaration \nof independence and its admission to our Organization \nas a new Member in July. \n On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the \ntragic attack on the World Trade Center in New York, I \nwould like to stress the importance of effectively \ncombating terrorism and taking action to prevent the \nformation and development of terrorist groups. A \n \n \n5 11-51670 \n \ncrucial task of policymakers is to create conditions in \nwhich terrorism cannot find a breeding ground. \n This year\u2019s theme of the general debate, \u201cThe \nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means\u201d, unquestionably represents the \npurposes of diplomacy and the fundamental reason \nwhy States decided to cooperate within the framework \nof international bodies and mechanisms, headed by the \nUnited Nations. In a certain sense, it is also closely \nconnected to the reform process of our Organization. \n The principle of the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes between States is enshrined in the Charter of \nthe United Nations and in many General Assembly \nresolutions, and the Republic of San Marino can only \nsupport that principle. Indeed, our country has always \ntried to settle conflicts by peaceful means and has \nalways believed in the power of dialogue, democracy \nand tolerance \u2014 values on which peaceful coexistence \namong peoples is based. With a view to achieving this \nprinciple in order to maintain international peace and \nsecurity, the Republic of San Marino supports the role \nand authority of the General Assembly and the Security \nCouncil. \n This year we have witnessed a massive popular \nuprising spreading across the squares of cities in North \nAfrica and the Middle East. These are protests for \ndemocracy and freedom, respect for human rights and \nsocial justice. At the forefront of this revolution are \nyoung people from the middle classes. Despite their \neducation, they have found themselves excluded from \nthe labour market or suffering under poor working \nconditions. \n The unusual scale of the Arab revolution, which \nhas taken the world by surprise, demonstrates that \nmajor political and institutional changes are needed, \nbecause our economic and social foundations have also \nchanged as a result of globalization. We cannot \nconsider this spontaneous uprising of people looking \nfor freedom, justice and democracy only in terms of \nsecurity. If the United Nations intends to play a pivotal \nrole in managing global governance, it should also be \nable to interpret the need for such changes and to \nsupport them, as far as possible. San Marino believes \nthat the United Nations must continue to play a leading \nrole in managing global governance. The deeply \ndemocratic nature of our Organization, with its \nuniversal participation and undisputed legitimacy, as \nwell as the richness and diversity of cultures and \ntraditions that are represented here, allow us to adopt \nan approach aimed at harmonizing the interests of the \nentire international community and at achieving \nsustainable human development. \n The global economic and financial crisis, the \ndevastating consequences of which are evident to all, \nhas unfortunately demonstrated that our existing \ninstitutions are unable to respond rapidly and \nadequately to such crises. This has led to a growth in \nthe influence of some informal groups, such as the \nGroup of Eight and the Group of 20 (G-20), on the \nmanagement of global economic governance. San \nMarino is grateful to those groups and for the role they \nhave played.  \n However, we believe it important to emphasize \nthat in their decision-making process, which should be \nmore transparent and inclusive, it is essential that they \ntake into account the interests, worries and aspirations \nof States outside their groups, particularly developing \ncountries. The actions of such informal groups should \nbe complementary to those of the United Nations, \nwhich will require the development of specific \nmechanisms to regulate their relations with our \nOrganization. We welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s \nparticipation in the G-20 meetings and the \nconsultations held by the rotating presidencies with the \nUnited Nations. However, we stress the importance of \ntransparency in relations between these informal \ngroups and the United Nations system, the only \nOrganization in a position to take decisions whose \nlegitimacy no one can challenge. \n The Republic of San Marino is concerned about \nthe consequences of the economic and financial crisis \nand other crises closely and inevitably linked to it. \nUnemployment is a very serious problem that faces \nevery country without distinction. Furthermore, in \nmany States the youth unemployment rate is twice as \nhigh as that for adults. Long-term unemployment has \nalso risen in the past few years. We believe that the \nUnited Nations should pay special attention to the issue \nof unemployment.  \n Unfortunately, the negative effects of the global \neconomic and financial crisis are still visible today. \nAlthough the international economy experienced a \nmodest recovery last year, we have not yet emerged \nfrom the 2008 crisis. And beyond the problem of \nunemployment, we are now confronting a global \nsovereign debt crisis. \n  \n \n11-51670 6 \n \n Is there a good recipe for recovery from the \ncrisis? Is a rigorous economic policy sufficient? Do \ninnovative measures for relaunching the world\u2019s \neconomy exist? Can these measures be shared, or are \nwe facing a deep systemic crisis requiring an in-depth \nanalysis of the way our societies function and a \nrethinking of current business models? I believe that if \nthe United Nations focused on these important issues, \nits leading role in global governance could not be \nquestioned by anyone. \n The destinies of our peoples are linked to global \nthreats in an increasingly direct way. Today, the threats \nof climate change and biodiversity loss, economic, \nfinancial and employment crises, food security, public \nhealth, disarmament and the non-proliferation of \nweapons and the fight against terrorism are recognized \nas being interdependent. On that basis, we should \ncreate a new form of international cooperation and \nmultilateralism so as to coordinate our policies at the \ninternational, national and regional levels. We have a \nduty to guarantee the full effectiveness of the \nOrganization\u2019s activities with a view to preserving and \nstrengthening its essential value as a point of reference \nfor the international community. \n The interdependence of such threats is more \nevident now than ever before. That is the case, for \nexample, of the impact of climate change on world \nfood security, which in turn poses a threat to security \nand peace, not only in Africa, where perhaps this \nrelationship can more easily be observed, but \nthroughout the world. Food insecurity fuels violent \nsocial conflicts. Climate change leads to a reduction in \nglobal food production, the most damaging effects of \nwhich are experienced in Africa and Asia. \n The populations of countries in a post-conflict \nsituation, countries that depend more directly on \nagriculture or the poorest developing countries will \nhave more difficulties than others in coping with rising \nfood prices due to droughts or other disasters caused by \nclimate change. Our country is following the \nhumanitarian emergency in the Horn of Africa with \ngreat concern. The populations of Somalia, Kenya, \nEthiopia and Djibouti are the victims of a severe \ndrought. This is a humanitarian emergency affecting \nover 12 million people, including many women and \nchildren. \n The Republic of San Marino is grateful to the \nSecretary-General for his rapid and significant actions \nin benefit of the affected populations. We also thank \nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \nand the Central Emergency Response Fund for their \nimmediate response and their substantial contribution \nto resolving the humanitarian emergency in the Horn of \nAfrica, and Member States for their financial \ncommitments. \n Another but no less important effect of climate \nchange is sea-level rise, which has an impact on the \nvery existence of many Member States. This problem \naffects not only small islands, but also large islands \nand countries with extensive coastlines. Therefore, this \nphenomenon affects a significant number of United \nNations Member States. \n The implications, interdependence and effects of \nserious global threats on populations and world peace \nand security are increasingly evident. With a view to \naddressing such challenges, we need a strong United \nNations, as well as effective and coordinated action in \nour economic, environmental and food policies at all \nlevels \u2014 both globally and regionally. These policies \nshould be designed to achieve sustainable, inclusive \nand equitable economic growth.  \n As I mentioned earlier, this year\u2019s theme is \ninevitably linked to the reform of the United Nations. \nThat reform will be fundamental to future world \nstability and the maintenance of international peace \nand security. It must remain the target of all our efforts.  \n The Republic of San Marino has been following \nwith interest the Security Council reform process since \n1994. In that regard, it is grateful to Ambassador Tanin \nfor the wisdom and impartiality with which he has \npresided over the intergovernmental negotiations on \nSecurity Council reform and for his tireless efforts to \nreach the broadest possible political agreement. We are \nconvinced that intergovernmental negotiations are the \nright framework within which to find a solution that \nreflects the interests and positions of all Members. It is \nessential to move beyond respective initial positions in \norder to negotiate the broadest possible agreement. The \nRepublic San Marino believes that the five key issues \nof reform \u2014 categories of membership, the question of \nthe veto, regional representation, the size of an \nenlarged Council and its working methods, and its \nrelationship with the General Assembly \u2014 are closely \ninterrelated and need to be considered as a whole.  \n Another major reform in the United Nations to \nwhich our country attaches great importance is the \n \n \n7 11-51670 \n \nrevitalization process of the General Assembly. The \nRepublic of San Marino supports this reform process \nand, in that regard, wishes to thank Lithuania and Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines for having co-chaired the \nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \nGeneral Assembly this year. \n The revitalization of the General Assembly is a \npolitically necessary reform and, at the same time, \nessential to the future of the United Nations. It is a \nreform that should involve all States in reaching an \nagreement based, again, on the broadest possible \npolitical consensus and aimed at reaffirming the central \nrole of the General Assembly as the most \nrepresentative body of the United Nations, as well as \nthe role and leadership of its President. Reform should \nmake the work of the General Assembly more \neffective, prevent duplication of its activities, and \nimprove its relations with the other United Nations \nbodies. Nevertheless, the revitalization of the General \nAssembly should not concern these aspects alone, \nhowever important they may be. The Assembly should \nbecome a key forum where solutions can be found to \nthe problems posed by the global threats that \nincreasingly unite the destinies of our peoples. \n There are many issues and themes on which the \nUnited Nations focuses its attention, and it is \nimpossible to address all of them. Therefore, I will \nhighlight some aspects that are perhaps lesser known, \nbut no less important. \n About 15 per cent of the world\u2019s population has \nsome kind of disability, while between 2 to 4 per cent \nsuffers from severe disabilities. Since the adoption in \n2006 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities, we have witnessed a clear affirmation of \nthe rights of the disabled. Today, the Convention has \nbeen ratified by over 100 countries. The international \ncommunity has taken important steps forward in terms \nof equality for and non-discrimination towards \ndisabled people, as well as their full inclusion and \nparticipation in the social, political and cultural life of \nsocieties. However, much remains to be done in order \nto implement the Convention, including the \nestablishment of legislative frameworks and policies at \nthe national and international levels. \n The international community should also deal \nwith the strong relationship between disability and \npoverty, and include that issue in future political \nstrategies. A similar approach is fundamental in efforts \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals. At \npresent, 80 per cent of persons with disabilities live in \ndeveloping countries and most live below the poverty \nline. In addition, many of the children who do not \nattend school have some kind of disability. Therefore, \nit is clear that targeted strategies and policies taking \ninto due account the situation of children with \ndisabilities should be adopted to achieve the Goal of \nuniversal primary education.  \n More than 8 million children under five years of \nage and 350,000 mothers die every year. Today, \n67 million children are still out of school, and \n195 million children under five years of age suffer \nfrom chronic malnutrition, which remains the major \ncause of childhood death. Every day, more than \n1,000 babies are born with HIV and about 5 million \nyoung people between 15 and 24 years of age are \nliving with this virus. \n Children continue to be the most vulnerable to \nand most affected by violence, abuse and exploitation. \nCurrently, more than 200 million children, especially \nthose in developing countries, do not have a birth \ncertificate. Sadly, most can barely access basic \nservices, such as health care and education, or enjoy \ntheir rights. Also, it is difficult to protect them. This \nthreatens to seriously undermine the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Republic of \nSan Marino joins the international community in \nsupporting resolution 65/1, entitled \u201cKeeping the \npromise: united to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals\u201d.  \n Gender equality is rightly placed high on the \nagenda of the United Nations. In many countries, \nmaternal mortality figures are still worrying, especially \nin the poorest areas of the world. Furthermore, young \npeople, girls and women are the most affected by HIV. \nUnfortunately, trafficking in women and children \nremains a serious problem. Women and girls continue \nto be subjected to humiliating practices, such as the \npayment of the bride price, child marriage, kidnapping \nand sexual violence, including domestic violence. \n Protecting the rights of women in conflict and \npost-conflict situations continues to be another high \npriority for the United Nations. Women facing such \nsituations are very often victims of sexual violence, \nmass rape, torture and arbitrary executions.  \n Schooling and education are vital to countering \ndiscrimination and favour the empowerment of women. \n  \n \n11-51670 8 \n \nImproving the quality of and access to education for \nwomen and children requires providing them with \ninstruments to improve their economic and social \nliving conditions. \n I have talked about groups of people who live in \nextremely difficult conditions in many areas of the \nworld and represent a very large share of the world\u2019s \npopulation. The primary task of each individual and \nState is to support every effort to help them live in \ndecent conditions and feelfully included in society. \nTheir progress will be our progress, and their smile \nwill be the light allowing us to look to the future with \noptimism.

        "file_text": "\nAllow me, at the outset, to commend the President of \nthe General Assembly and his whole team for their \nelection to the Bureau of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. We would like to express to his \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, our gratitude for the \nexcellent work he accomplished, work that has \nbenefited our Organization. I also congratulate Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, the Secretary-General, on the renewal of his \nmandate. \n Taking the floor from this rostrum has always \nbeen for me a special moment and a happy occasion to \nrecall some current issues of importance to my country \nand the world. This moment is all the more special as it \ncomes at a time when the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo is preparing to hold general elections, the \nsecond since those of 2006. \n Thus, it is appropriate to grasp the full \nsignificance of this key period for the Congo, because \nit confirms a definitive break from the spiral of \nviolence and instability that has characterized the \ncountry in recent decades. It is seen as a decisive phase \nin that, more than ever, it commits the Congolese \npeople to a lasting democratic culture.  \n Despite multifaceted challenges punctuating the \nelectoral process, the National Independent Electoral \nCommission, our people and their Government are \ndoing their utmost to hold transparent and credible \nelections in a calm climate. The elections are \nultimately proof of a return to the effective peace for \nwhich Congolese men and women have yearned. \nToday, peace and security reign throughout the national \n \n \n25 11-50871 \n \nterritory. The Republic\u2019s institutions are all in place \nand operating normally. \n As peace and security in my country have been \nrecovered, the United Nations presence merits \nreconsideration. Indeed, the role of the United Nations \nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo (MONUSCO) must necessarily \nadapt its vision and its action on the ground. In that \nphase of consolidation, MONUSCO must increasingly \nmove beyond the strict format of peacekeeping \noperations in order to assist the country in its efforts to \ndevelop and to relaunch the economy. \n Enormous progress has certainly been made in \nthe areas of peace and security. However, many other \nchallenges remain, and the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo is determined to meet them. The mobilization \nand support of all should be along those lines. I refer in \nparticular to the following areas of concerns: \nstrengthening the capacity of the security sector, the \narmy, the police, the judiciary and penitentiary systems \nto ensure the rights and security of citizens and to \nstabilize the country and the region; the increasing and \norderly return of displaced persons to their places of \norigin and of refugees to their respective countries; the \nongoing demobilization and reintegration of child \nsoldiers leaving armed groups; effective control over \nthe exploitation of our natural resources; and building \ngood-neighbourly relations with the States around us.  \n In that regard, after several years of conflict the \ncountries in the region have reached the conclusion \nthat war is the worst enemy of man and his \ndevelopment. It exacerbates problems rather than \nresolves them. That explains their common will and \nour efforts to seek peace at all costs. That is the reality \ntoday. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is at \npeace with all its neighbours. Now is the time for \nreconstruction and development. \n In that regard, I would like to welcome the recent \nentry of the Republic of South Sudan as a Member \nState of our universal Organization and to convey to its \npeople my most heartfelt wishes for peace, happiness \nand prosperity. \n Another challenge that my country must face is \nthat of maintaining economic growth. Despite a \ndifficult international climate, today the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo shows a positive growth rate \nabove the African average, and it will continue that \nmomentum thanks to the efforts to harness its \neconomy. However, it is also true that such growth \nremains dependent, to a large degree, on the global \neconomy. \n Having spoken about the situation in my country, \nI would now like to address some big issues of current \nconcern.  \n The United Nations has responded to a good \nnumber of challenges that justified its establishment at \nthe end of the Second World War. In 66 years, the \nworld has changed greatly, and the pace of change \nincreases every day.  \n A great institution such as ours cannot remain \nstatic while its setting constantly changes. The time has \ncome to envisage adapting the Organization to current \nrealities so as to improve its effectiveness and, above \nall, to bolster confidence among Member States. To do \nthat, it must make substantial progress in the major \nareas of a reform too long awaited, whether the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly, reform of the \nSecurity Council or the role of the Economic and \nSocial Council, which needs to be strengthened. A \nSecurity Council that incorporates equally the \nlegitimate aspirations of developing countries, \nparticularly those of Africa, would certainly be more \nlegitimate. \n Furthermore, the issues of climate change and the \nprotection of nature demand a changed approach that \ntakes into account the aspirations of all peoples. That is \nan area where it is prudent to demonstrate a spirit of \ncompromise and solidarity in the interest, of course, of \nall countries.  \n That is also the case for the crucial goals of \ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, which remain hostage to the policy \nof double standards, such as discriminatory practices \nand non-compliance with commitments made, in \nparticular by certain nuclear Powers. \n The fight against impunity and against human \nrights violations, which is subjected to a selective \napproach and the partisan implementation of \ninternational humanitarian law, gives rise to legitimate \ndoubts about the exploitation of these noble causes for \npolitical ends. Our Organization must address these \nissues. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo believes \nthat the Israeli-Palestinian question should be a major \nconcern for our universal Organization. The United \n  \n \n11-50871 26 \n \nNations should unflaggingly continue its efforts to find \nan equitable solution that bears in mind the legitimate \ninterests of two peoples, each with the right to live in \npeace and security. The Middle East cannot recover \npeace and stability without a fair and lasting settlement \nof this question.  \n I would not continue my remarks without \nmentioning the more active cooperation that we would \nlike to see between the African Union and the United \nNations in the area of conflict management. It is \nadvisable, in my humble opinion, that we strengthen \nthis cooperation and make better use of it in order to \nreduce the number of hot spots on our continent. We all \nstand to gain. \n I have focused my remarks today on the need to \nstrengthen peace. That is the essential precondition for \nall progress, but a peace limited to an absence of \nstomping boots is not peace. Without ignoring the \nsuccesses, it must be said that in this area our \nOrganization still has an enormous amount to do to \nensure that each and every person is able to participate \nin the progress of all of humanity. \n I conclude by renewing our wishes to see the \nconcept and management of international affairs \nmodified through an effective and sincere commitment \nof the entire community of nations for a renewal and \nstrengthening of the multilateral system."

        "file_text": "I \nshould like to thank the outgoing President of the \nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Joseph \nDeiss of Switzerland, and congratulate Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar on his election as \nPresident of the sixty-sixth session of the General \nAssembly. May I also express my gratitude for the \nefforts and leadership of the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, who has skilfully guided our \nOrganization in these difficult and demanding times.\n Two world wars taught humanity the necessity to \ninfuse national relations with respect for a few simple \nyet powerful ideals. That is what the United Nations is \nall about \u2014 respect for peace and good-neighbourly \nrelations; respect for the rule of law and the \ninternational justice system; and respect for the \nfundamental right of every person on this planet to \nhave a chance for a better life. The United Nations is \nwhat we, its Member States, make of it. We are the \ndriving force behind its accomplishments. We are the \nreason behind any of its failures. The United Nations is \nwhere we meet and agree or disagree on global \ncooperation, and when we agree, humanity becomes \nstronger. \n Today the United Nations is leading vital \ninternational cooperation in tackling climate change \nand desertification. There is also the challenge of \nnon-communicable diseases, which hinder \nmacroeconomic development and keep the bottom \nbillions of people locked in chronic poverty. \nUnregulated migration is putting huge pressure on \nsome countries, including Greece, as a result of \u2014 \neven to the further detriment of \u2014 the low level of \ndevelopment in the countries of origin, poverty and \nwars. There is the crucial contribution of the United \nNations and its Human Rights Council on human rights \nissues, a contribution that can grow with a stronger \nmandate for the Human Rights Council. Greece is \nstanding for election to the Council for the 2012 term \nand deeply values the support of every single one of its \npartners in that effort.  \n Perhaps the most overarching responsibilities of \nthe United Nations lie in the area of peace and security, \nfor without peace and security it is much more \ndifficult, if not impossible, to pursue the myriad other \ngoals of the Organization. Those goals include \nensuring nuclear security, combating terrorism and \ncombating piracy. They also include managing crises \nas they arise, as in the recent case of Libya, and \nworking together with our partners in the international \ncommunity to establish and keep peace. This also \n  \n \n11-51197 16 \n \nmeans, as I said earlier, fostering good-neighbourly \nrelations the world over. \n Just as we need to work together as global \npartners to face the challenges of our time and the \nchallenges of the future, each of us also has a role to \nplay in a given region. Greece\u2019s immediate region is \nSouth-East Europe, the Balkans. Greece has a vision \nfor peace, stability and cooperation in our region. Its \nkey component is the European perspective of our \nregion as a whole and of our individual neighbours. To \nthis end, two years ago Greece launched Agenda 2014, \nwhich is aimed at revitalizing our neighbours\u2019 efforts \nto realize European aspirations, on the one hand, while \nalso re-igniting the European Union\u2019s vision of \nwelcoming the countries of the Balkans into the \nEuropean family. Indeed, creating a European \nneighbourhood of peace and cooperation in south-\neastern Europe should be our collective goal, and that \nis because peace and cooperation are anything but a \nforegone conclusion in the Balkans. Recent history, \noften bloody history, makes that abundantly clear. \n There are still pending issues that need to be \nresolved. One serious obstacle to the consolidation of \npeace and security in our neighbourhood is the Kosovo \nissue. Recent progress in the European Union-brokered \ntalks between Belgrade and Pristina gives some cause \nfor optimism in the wake of the tensions we saw in the \nregion over the summer. Those tensions remain. They \nstill need to be dealt with and defused. Greece wishes \nto facilitate the process of reconciliation and \ncompromise. It wishes to foster the kind of \nunderstanding that our neighbourhood needs on the \npath to its common future in the European family. That \nis a policy that works. Regional cooperation platforms, \nthe South-East European Cooperation Process, the \nBlack Sea Economic Coordination Organization, the \nregional Cooperation Council and others are bringing \nus closer together as partners. Serbia has made \nimpressive progress on its path to the European Union, \nprogress that must be recognized without question \nmarks. So has Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina \nmust be supported in its efforts towards reconciliation, \nunity and progress. Albania is in the process of \novercoming internal divisions and returning to the path \nof reforms under specific European Union criteria. \nCroatia\u2019s success story gives impetus to the entire \nenlargement process for the Balkans. \n Another issue that needs our attention is that of \nthe name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia, which is not really and has never been a \nname issue per se, but instead a sincere effort to ensure \nthat in our volatile region we put behind us, once and \nfor all, notions of irredentism, of attempting to rewrite \nhistory and borders, so that our children can be raised \nnot with suspicions and bitterness towards each other \nbut with friendship and hope for living next to each \nother. Greece believes, and has repeatedly stated, that \nthe solution lies in a fair compromise, in a name with a \ngeographical qualifier since Macedonia is a geographic \nregion that overlaps the territory of more than one \ncountry, and that this name must be used in relation to \neveryone, erga omnes. We want to resolve this issue so \nthat we can finally realize the huge potential of our \nrelationship on the basis of openness, honesty and \ntrust. It is high time to reach a successful and mutually \nbeneficial conclusion. As I have often said, this should \nbe a time to write history, not to keep trying to rewrite \nit. \n South-East Europe is only one side of Greece\u2019s \nneighbourhood. In our southern neighbourhood, the \neastern Mediterranean, we have witnessed the \nawakening of people\u2019s desire for democracy, the hope \nfor a better future. We have witnessed the Arab Spring. \nOur proximity to the region and to the countries there \nthat have been swept by calls for change is reflected in \nour active presence in the region. Add to that a long-\nstanding tradition of relations of trust and friendship \nwith the Arab world and Members can see why Greece \nhas embraced a vital role in these developments.  \n In Libya we conducted unprecedented \nevacuations for tens of thousands of non-Libyans, \nprovided ground support for the implementation of the \nLibya no-fly zone, mediated the release of European \nmilitary personnel early in the crisis and established a \ndiplomatic presence early on in Benghazi to liaise with \nthe National Transitional Council. We are now offering \ninfrastructure on Crete as a staging area for the efforts \nto deal with the humanitarian situation in Libya. The \nimportance we attach to developments in Libya, Egypt, \nTunisia and throughout the region derives from the \npoint I made earlier. Without peace and security one \ndoes not have cooperation, the cooperation needed for \ndevelopment and for improving the day-to-day lives of \nthe people. \n We, as the international community, have an \nobligation to help our southern neighbours achieve \ntheir goal of democracy, of having a voice in their \naffairs and of hope and future prosperity. I am talking \n \n \n17 11-51197 \n \nabout the same rights that the Syrian people have also \nbeen demanding for months, the rights that their own \nleadership is at present violently denying them. The \nArab world does not need new hegemons who see the \npresent turmoil as an opportunity to promote self-\nserving agendas or for establishing new spheres of \ngeostrategic influence or economic power. It needs \ngenuine friends who see Arabs as equals and who are \nwilling selflessly to assist the Arab world in its \ntransition to democracy and true self-determination. \nGreece and the European Union, under the guidance of \nthe United Nations, can and must play that role. \n Nowhere is the lack of peace and security more \npronounced and more chronic than with regard to the \nPalestinian question. Greece supports unequivocally \nPalestine\u2019s right to statehood. It is now our \nresponsibility, the responsibility of every Member State \nof the United Nations, to respect the Palestinian \ndecision to request membership and, more importantly, \nto turn this into an opportunity that will jump-start \nnew, direct negotiations. Palestine has a right to exist \nfinally as an independent State, just as Israel \u2014 let us \nnot forget \u2014 has an equal right to exist in full and \nuncompromised security. The European Union, on its \nown account and within the Quartet, has a crucial role \nto play in this effort. Greece will continue to engage in \ndialogue with both sides and support Catherine Ashton \nand the European Union\u2019s efforts within the Quartet \nand with the parties. \n Within this context of regional tension and \nvolatility but also great potential hope, it should be \nself-evident that we need to avoid adding still greater \ntensions in the eastern Mediterranean region, which is \nwhy we are deeply concerned by the recent threats and \nhostile actions against the Republic of Cyprus by our \nneighbour Turkey, in violation of international law. As \nthe European Union, the United States, Russia and \nothers have already stated, Turkey\u2019s threats and actions \nover the past few days and weeks are contrary to \ninternational law and they must cease. We believe that \nthe path of tension is a wrong and dangerous path. \nInstead of threats our region needs strong countries that \ncan work together to promote stability, cooperation and \ngood-neighbourly relations among all, and always \nwithin the confines of international law.  \n That is the hope and example that we can give to \na region and that a region expects of us, which is why \nGreece is committed to the peaceful path of \nexploratory talks with Turkey for the delimitation of a \ncontinental shelf, failing which we believe we should \nsubmit the issue to the International Court of Justice \nfor resolution. We expect Turkey to refrain from \nactions that undermine that spirit of cooperation. That \nis why we strongly support the United Nations sanction \ntalks currently under way between President \nChristofias of Cyprus and Mr. Eroglu, talks aimed at \nthe reunification of Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal \nfederation and the ending of Turkey\u2019s illegal \noccupation in accordance, with United Nations \nresolutions and European Union law. \n Finally, economic development and fair \ndistribution of wealth are key prerequisites for long-\nterm stability and security. My country, in the midst of \nits own worst financial and economic crisis in recent \nhistory, has not only not shut itself in its shell but \nremains a leading investor in a region, especially in the \nwestern Balkans, contributing to the creation of tens of \nthousands of jobs. Internally we are overhauling our \neconomy by investing in sustainable growth and in \nGreece\u2019s competitive advantage sectors, including \ngreen energy, shipping, tourism, sustainable agriculture \nand high-tech infrastructure. Externally, our businesses \nare becoming even more outward-looking. The \neconomic integration of our region along the growth \naxes I have described, and other complementary ones, \nis certain to multiply its economic potential. It is thus \ncertain further to enhance the peaceful integration and \ncooperation of all of its people.  \n It has often been said that every crisis is also an \nopportunity. If that is true, then our region, riddled as it \nhas been for decades with big and small crises, is \narguably today the region in the world that harbours \nthe greatest opportunities for peace, growth and \nstability. It is in our hands to make this happen. Let us \nbegin."

        "file_text": "I would like to \njoin previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on \nyour election as President of General Assembly at the \nsixty-sixth session, and wish you every success in that \nhighly responsible post. I thank your predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his productive work \nduring the last session. \n I also express my profound respect and gratitude \nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, for his leadership and dedication to \nrevitalizing the United Nations Organization. \n With regard to the theme of this year\u2019s general \ndebate, we welcome the adoption at the sixty-fifth \nsession of resolution 65/283 on strengthening the role \nof mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes, \nconflict prevention and resolution. In that document, \nthe General Assembly reiterated that all Member States \nshould strictly adhere to their obligations, as laid down \nin the United Nations Charter, and reaffirmed, inter \nalia, the commitment to respect the sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity and political independence of all \nStates. \n Azerbaijan looks forward to the relevant guidance \nfor more effective mediation, as indicated in the \nresolution, and we are ready to actively contribute to \nits elaboration. Unfortunately, we have to admit that \n \n \n29 11-51670 \n \nnot all States approach their international obligations \nresponsibly and comply with the generally accepted \nnorms and principles of international law. \n For almost two decades, we have witnessed the \nflagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and \nother documents of international law by the Republic \nof Armenia, which has perpetrated aggression against \nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic \nof Azerbaijan. As a result of that aggression, almost \n20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan remains under \noccupation and about 1 million Azerbaijani refugees \nand internally displaced persons are unable to return to \ntheir homes. \n In 1993, the Security Council adopted four \nresolutions (resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993) 874 \n(1993) and 884 (1993)) demanding the immediate, \ncomplete and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian \nforces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan \nand reaffirmed the sovereignty, territorial integrity and \ninviolability of the internationally recognized borders \nof Azerbaijan. The same appeals were made also by \nother international organizations. Unfortunately, \nArmenia continues to ignore the calls of the \ninternational community. \n What is even more worrisome is that, instead of \npreparing its people for a peaceful, prosperous and \nstable future in friendship and cooperation with the \nneighbouring countries, the leadership of Armenia \ncontinues to publicly incite the future generations to \nnew wars, violence and aggression and to propagate, \nby all means, the dangerous ideas of animosity and \nhatred towards not only Azerbaijan, but also other \npeoples of the region. \n Illegal activities in the occupied territories of \nAzerbaijan, including the implantation of ethnic \nArmenian settlers, as well as the destruction and \nappropriation of historical and cultural heritage, \nrepresent another source of serious concern. Such \nactivities serve to further consolidate the current status \nquo of the occupation, securing the results of ethnic \ncleansing and colonization of the seized lands, as well \nas to seriously hamper the prospects for conflict \nresolution. Earlier in this Hall, we heard a very \naggressive and unconstructive statement by the \nPresident of Armenia. He openly confirmed that \ndestructive policy of Armenia. (see ) \n The Field Assessment Mission conducted by the \nMinsk Group Co-Chairs of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe in October 2010 to \nthe occupied territories of Azerbaijan, stated, inter alia, \nthat the status quo of the occupation was unacceptable \nand urged Armenia to put an end to its illegal practices \nin those territories.  \n As a country suffering from the occupation of its \nterritories and the forcible displacement of hundreds of \nthousands of its citizens, Azerbaijan is the most \ninterested party in the earliest negotiated settlement of \nthe conflict. Our position is well known to the \ninternational community. It is based on strict adherence \nto the norms and principles of international law, \naccording to which the acquisition of territory by force \nis inadmissible and must be rejected resolutely and \nunconditionally. \n It is absolutely illogical that the leadership of \nArmenia, which has implemented the total ethnic \ncleansing of not only the occupied territories of \nAzerbaijan, but also of the Azerbaijani population in its \nown territory, is trying to apply the principle of self-\ndetermination. It is obvious that one cannot expel \npeoples from their homes on ethnic grounds and, at the \nsame time, speak about self-determination for those \nwho remain on the same grounds. \n Azerbaijan recognizes that the right of peoples to \nself-determination can be implemented only  \n \u201cat all times in conformity with the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations \nand with the relevant norms of international law, \nincluding those relating to territorial integrity of \nStates\u201d,  \nas enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act. \n Azerbaijan is confident that the conflict \nresolution must start with the withdrawal of Armenian \narmed forces from the occupied territories, within the \nfixed timetable, followed by the restoration of \ncommunications, the return of refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons, and the creation of conditions for \nthe peaceful coexistence of Azerbaijanis and \nArmenians in the Nagorno Karabakh region within the \nterritorial integrity of Azerbaijan. That step-by-step \napproach, which has been proposed by mediators and \nsupported by the international community, except, \nunfortunately, the leadership of Armenia, can bring \ndurable peace, stability and predictability to the region. \n Azerbaijan still maintains its interest, motivation \nand patience in that very hard and sensitive process of \n  \n \n11-51670 30 \n \nnegotiations. We believe that the international \ncommunity will convince the Armenian side to respect \nthe generally accepted norms and principles of \ninternational law and cease abusing the right of \nAzerbaijanis to live within their own territories, \nincluding the Nagorno Karabakh region. In return, we \nare ready to guarantee the highest level of self-rule for \nthat region within the Republic of Azerbaijan. \n I would like to touch upon another important \nissue of the international agenda \u2014 Palestine. \nAzerbaijan reaffirms its adherence to the position \nexpressed by the majority of the United Nations \nMember States. We reiterate our long-standing \nsolidarity with the people and leadership of Palestine, \nand believe that the time has come to reach a \nbreakthrough in that long-standing and very important \nissue. The time has come for Palestine to be fully \nrepresented at the United Nations. \n Azerbaijan is determined to contribute further to \nthe realization of the development goals and objectives \nagreed within the United Nations. In recent years, \nAzerbaijan has enhanced its humanitarian assistance to \nsupport international and national efforts aimed at \neradicating poverty and promoting sustainable \ndevelopment and global prosperity for all. We pay \nparticular attention to addressing the special needs and \nvulnerabilities of developing and least developed \ncountries, as well as those recovering from natural \ndisasters and suffering from climate change, in \nparticular small island States. \n The recent humanitarian crisis in the Horn of \nAfrica once again demonstrated the importance of \nglobal solidarity. Azerbaijan has provided urgent aid to \nsupport the ongoing efforts towards the eradication of \nfamine in that region. The Government of Azerbaijan is \ncurrently considering additional funding to support the \ninternational community in ramping up its efforts to \nrespond to the humanitarian situation and contribute to \na mid- and long-term sustainable solution to the crisis \nin the Horn of Africa. \n Proceeding from the fruitful cooperation between \nthe United Nations and the Government of Azerbaijan, \nresolution 64/186, entitled \u201cBuilding connectivity \nthrough the Trans-Eurasian Information Super \nHighway\u201d, initiated by Azerbaijan, was adopted at the \nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly on \n21 December 2009. As the main coordinator of the \nproject, Azerbaijan has conducted a feasibility study \nand is financing the Secretariat of the project. We have \ntaken a number of steps towards the establishment of a \nconsortium, comprising of major telecommunications \noperators in the region. \n Azerbaijan has always been a place of \ncoexistence and tolerance among various faiths, ethnic \ngroups and philosophies. It is one of the unique places \nwhere different cultures and civilizations meet at the \ncrossroads between East and West and North and \nSouth. \n As a bridge between cultures and an active \nmember of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \nCivilizations, Azerbaijan feels responsible for \npromoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue \nbased on mutual respect and understanding. Thus, over \nthe past years, we hosted a number of high-profile and \naction-oriented events, including the Summit of World \nReligious Leaders in April 2010, the World Forum for \nIntercultural Dialogue from 7 to 9 April 2011 and other \nsimilar events. \n Desiring to contribute further to the maintenance \nof international peace, security, stability and prosperity, \nAzerbaijan has put forward its candidature for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nterm of 2012-2013. The elections will be held this year \non 21 October at the General Assembly. \n The year 2012 marks the twentieth anniversary of \nAzerbaijan\u2019s membership in the United Nations, \nalthough, unlike other candidates from the Group of \nEastern European States, we have never had an \nopportunity to become a member of the Security \nCouncil. Azerbaijan\u2019s election to the Security Council \nwould contribute to redressing the underrepresentation \nof small developing States and bring a more balanced \nmembership to that United Nations organ. The \nGovernment of the Republic of Azerbaijan would \nhighly appreciate the valuable support of the States \nMembers of the United Nations for its candidature for \na non-permanent seat in the Security Council."

        "file_text": "Let me start by \ncongratulating His Excellency Ambassador Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and \nassuring him that he will have the fullest cooperation \nof the Icelandic delegation. \n In recent weeks, we have witnessed the worst \nhunger crisis of this century in the Horn of Africa. It is \na devastating reminder that fighting poverty and \nhunger is still the most important and challenging \nundertaking of our times. Our collective duty and \nresponsibility is to help our weakest brothers and \nsisters. As wealthier nations, we must do better in \nproviding relief. We must act with more speed and \nmore generosity to help those who are deprived of the \nbasic necessities of life \u2014 food and water. I can say, \nmy friends, that in Iceland, we have indeed decided to \ndo so. \n I am quite happy to be able to tell the Assembly \ntoday that the Icelandic Parliament has unanimously \nagreed to substantially increase our contribution to \ndeveloping nations in the coming financial year. It has \nalso accepted a plan to raise our aid to the goal of \n0.7 per cent of our gross national income. That is our \npledge, as agreed by every political party in the \nIcelandic Parliament. \n The fight against hunger and poverty is the same \nstruggle as the one we wage to protect our planet from \nthe ravages caused by the greed of our own species. All \nMembers know that, next year, we will celebrate the \ntwentieth anniversary of the bright new vision \nintroduced at the historic Earth Summit in Rio. Over \nthese past 20 years, deep concern for the environment \nhas indeed moved to the forefront of the global agenda. \nBut the Assembly also knows the sobering truth, which \nis that the ambitions of Rio are still a far cry from \nbeing realized. Actions are still needed. If ever there \nwas a time to act boldly, that time is now. \n The key theme of Rio next year will be the \u201cgreen \neconomy\u201d. I assure the Assembly that my country has \nexpertise to offer that can help to fuel a green \nrevolution. Renewable energy, marine health, the \nsustainable use of land and, not least, gender equality, \nwhich have always been at the core of the Icelandic \nforeign policy, are the four issues that we shall bring to \nRio next year. What we really need is indeed a \nrevolution, a green revolution. We need a seismic shift \nfrom fossil fuels to renewable energy. That is the only \nway to turn the ship. \n In Iceland, we have some cutting-edge \ntechnology on geothermal energy that we want to \nshare. That splendid form of renewable energy is the \nmost undervalued and overlooked source of cheap \npower in the world. Of course, geothermal is most \n  \n \n11-51390 4 \n \ncertainly not a silver bullet, but it needs to be a part of \nthe portfolio that we must develop to solve emissions \nproblems. Many members know that Central and South \nAmerica, East Africa and South-East Asia are home to \nvast areas literally brimming with geothermal potential. \nIcelandic know-how, coupled with outside financing, \ncould go a long way in making those areas self-\nsufficient in terms of green energy. \n As one of the largest fishing nations, Iceland has \nalways been deeply protective of the health of the \noceans. Today, climate change threatens to place the \nfisheries of the world under a new strain. As we speak, \nthe acidification of the oceans resulting from human \ncarbon emissions is affecting the health of the marine \nenvironment. This is especially true in the Arctic and \nits vicinity, which is my home. As a marine biologist, I \nfear that, more likely sooner than later, this may affect \nthe world\u2019s fishing stocks, which are a vital source of \nprotein for more than 1 billion people. This is just one \nmore argument why we so urgently need to conclude a \npost-Kyoto agreement later this year on the reduction \nof greenhouse gases. \n Every day, the Arctic bears silent witness to the \nimpact of climate change. The snow that I experienced \nas a child is today fast becoming a rare event for my \ntwo teenage daughters. The sad truth is that the Arctic \nglaciers and the Arctic sea ice are melting at a much \nfaster rate than anyone ever anticipated. It is of course \ntrue that the disappearance of the sea ice will open up \nnew and shorter transport routes from the Pacific to the \nNorth Atlantic via the Arctic Ocean. We most certainly \nwill also see huge areas open up for the exploitation of \noil and gas resources. \n This will come at a price, however. Climatic \nchanges are forcing the peoples of the Arctic, such as \nour neighbours in Greenland, to change their living \nhabits. These changes will also melt the tundra, which \nacts as a carbon buffer against the climate system, and \nthus further accelerate the warming of the planet. The \nalready-fragile ecosystem of the Arctic will become \neven more brittle. \n Let us remember what happened in the Gulf of \nMexico and let us be aware that oil breaks down very, \nvery slowly in the extreme cold of the Arctic. We \nshould not allow the exploitation of the Arctic without \napplying the strictest rules. That must be the \nprecondition for every human move into Arctic \nresources. \n I am often asked whether a country like Iceland, \nwhich is not geographically small but has, admittedly, \nslightly fewer people than most, can have any say in \naction on issues of global concern, be it in Rio or in \nNew York. Well, to lift a phrase from a famous \nstatesman who spoke from this very podium a few days \nago: \u201cYes, we can\u201d.  \n Twenty years ago, in 1991, we in Iceland watched \na television broadcast of thousands of brave Latvians, \nLithuanians and Estonians taking their destiny into \ntheir own hands. They reached out to the international \ncommunity, among them the people of Iceland, and \nasked for help in breaking the ice that was impeding \ntheir international recognition. \n The great British statesman, Lord Palmerston, \nonce made a famous statement to the effect that there is \nno such thing as eternal friendship between nations and \nthat only eternal interests could determine how nations \nreacted towards each other. That well-known mantra is \nstill taught today in every bad school of political \nscience. My friends, if Palmerston\u2019s words had \nprevailed, Iceland would have turned a deaf ear to the \ncall of the freedom fighters in the Baltics. We did not. \nIn the historic year of 1991, Iceland became the first to \nrecognize the restored sovereignty of the Baltic States. \nWe did that out of respect for the principles that are so \nvitally important to small nations: the right to choose \nyour own destiny, to carve out your own future \u2014 the \nundeniable right of small nations to be independent. \nPrinciples do matter in politics. \n Based on the same principle that led Iceland to \nrecognize the Baltic States in 1991, today we support \nthe Palestinian struggle for statehood. Based on that \nvery same principle, Iceland feels that the international \ncommunity should welcome Palestine as a new \nMember State in the United Nations, based on the \npre-1967 borders \u2014 exactly the same criteria as those \nlaid down by the European Union, the Quartet and \nlately, also by President Barack Obama in his strong \nspeech in May. \n I have been to Gaza. I have talked to the people: \nthe fishermen who no longer can ply their trade, the \nyoung people who are unemployed, the families that \nneed a roof over their head. I have also been to the \nWest Bank. I have seen with my own eyes how the land \nof the Palestinians has literally been cut to pieces by \nhorrible walls of separation. That is wrong. That is \n \n \n5 11-51390 \n \nunjust. That is against every moral code that Iceland \nhas ever stood for as a guardian of human rights.  \n We must remember that Palestine today is really \ndoing just the same thing as Israel did in 1947, and \nIceland and so many other States at the time supported \nIsrael\u2019s action. Israel took its case to the United \nNations and emerged with statehood. Palestine \ndeserves the same. And I think it is hypocrisy to \nsuggest otherwise. In the middle of the democratic \nrevolution brought on by the fresh breeze of the Arabic \nSpring and inspired, not least, by women and young \npeople, it would be foolish to deny Palestine its right to \nstatehood. Such denial would act against reconciliation \nin the region. \n It will, perhaps, not come as any surprise to \nMembers here, but Iceland will therefore vote \u201cyes\u201d, \nwhen a resolution on Palestinian statehood comes to a \nvote in the General Assembly. Furthermore, the \nIcelandic Government is determined to fully recognize \nPalestine and will next week submit to the Parliament \nof Iceland a resolution on the recognition of Palestine \nas a sovereign and independent State. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me at the outset welcome \nSouth Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United \nNations. I commend the successful conduct of the \nreferendum on independence as a manifestation of the \nprinciple of self-determination. That historic act has \nput an end to a long civil war on the African continent \nand opened up new horizons for the stability and \nprosperity of the people of South Sudan. \n Hungary fully aligns itself with the statement \nmade earlier by President Van Rompuy on behalf of the \nEuropean Union. To complement this, allow me to \noutline my country\u2019s position on three issues figuring \nhigh on our foreign policy and development agenda, \nnamely, the Arab Spring, sustainable development and \nthe prevention and control of non-communicable \ndiseases. \n More than 20 years ago, Central and Eastern \nEurope, including my country, Hungary, was the scene \nof sweeping political changes. Beginning in early 2011, \nthe world has witnessed, yet again, the outburst of \npopular will for profound transformation, this time in \nNorth Africa and the Middle East. Those of us who \ntook active part in the democratization process and the \ntransition to the rule of law and market economies in \nour region have been following the events of the Arab \nSpring with great empathy and understanding.  \n The revolutions leading to sweeping shifts in \nTunisia, Egypt and other countries were equally driven \nby sincere desires for a better life and for putting in \nplace new political systems capable of better \nresponding to the aspirations of all parts of society. The \nvoices of Tahrir Square echoed the aspirations of \nmillions of people. \n The overthrow of autocratic regimes is, \nnevertheless, only the first step in that direction. As \nshown by our own experience, the most difficult stages \nof the transformation process are yet to come. The \nvictorious popular uprisings of the Arab Spring have \nencountered tremendous challenges in terms of \nestablishing new power structures, drafting new \nconstitutions and other basic laws, as well as \nconducting free and democratic elections, just to \nmention a few. Essentially those measures require an \n  \n \n11-51191 2 \n \ninternally driven process, carried out with the support \nof the international community. \n Hungarian society has, on the one hand, already \nsuccessfully met many of those challenges and, on the \nother hand, made some avoidable mistakes. We \ntherefore feel equipped to share our experiences and to \noffer a substantive toolkit for good governance and \ndemocratic change. As a good friend and supporting \npartner, Hungary truly hopes that those undergoing \ntransitional periods today will be able to benefit from \nboth our achievements and our omissions. \n Far be it from us, of course, to try to give advice \nor provide ready-made solutions. While we advocate \nthe universal character of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, as well as the virtues of the rule \nof law and good governance, we believe that those \nideals can be implemented only in conjunction with \nrespect for the cultural, religious and other traditions of \neach nation. \n At this stage of what we see as a long transformation \nprocess in the Arab world, we thus offer to share our own \nexperiences and lessons learned. The Hungarian \nGovernment, in cooperation with non-governmental \norganizations, has already carried out, and plans to \ncarry out in future, concrete projects and programmes \naimed at, inter alia, assisting the new emerging \ndemocracies in North Africa and the Middle East in the \nfield of institution-building, security-sector reform, and \ndrawing up the legislative framework for political and \neconomic renewal. We welcome the central role and \nincreasing involvement of the United Nations and its \nvarious agencies in support of the democratization of \nthose countries. Hungary stands ready to contribute to \nsuch efforts and provide its specialized expertise. \n Over the past two decades, since the Earth \nSummit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the three pillars of \nsustainable development have been the focus of the \ninternational development agenda. Time has shown that \nonly a coherent approach to the environmental, \neconomic and social aspects of this concept can ensure \nthe long-term survival and prosperity of mankind. We \nshould not miss this chance to formulate new courses \nof action in this era of reinforced mutual \ninterdependence and globalization. \n Against the background of the constantly \ndeteriorating global environment, it is an increasingly \ndemanding task to strike the necessary balance \nbetween ensuring growth in all regions of the world, a \ndecent life for our societies and the preservation of \nnatural resources in the interests of the survival of our \nplanet. One of the responses to this dilemma is the \nconcept of a green economy, which is gaining ever-\ngreater support. We consider the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development as a unique \nevent aimed at generating the widest possible support \nfor and acceptance of this green concept. Its goal is to \nsupport the sustainability of socio-economic \ndevelopment at the national, regional and global levels.  \n In addition, the concept of a green economy has \nthe potential to also contribute to job creation and the \neradication of poverty. If implemented in a coherent \nmanner, it will create new resources for achieving the \ninternationally agreed development goals. There is no \ndoubt that achieving these goals will require innovative \nthinking in terms of technology transfer, investment \nand fair trade. \n In order to put this concept into practice, a \nreorganization of the environmental architecture of the \nUnited Nations is needed. Such reform should pursue \nthe goal of streamlining and unifying the existing \nstructures, with a view to increasing the coherence and \nefficiency of the system as a whole. \n It is our shared responsibility to develop joint \nstrategies to mitigate the effects of non-communicable \ndiseases. Their rapid growth is preventable and can be \ncontrolled to a significant extent. Hungary has been in \nthe forefront of this fight, with national cancer and \ndiabetes control systems in place that may contribute to \npaving the way for functional alternatives around the \nworld. It is also our fundamental belief that the \ndevelopment of comprehensive national and regional \nstrategies for control programmes can significantly \nlower the incidence of these illnesses. This can \ncontribute to prevention, early detection and adequate \ntreatment in a cost-effective way. We are also proud of \nHungary\u2019s long-standing tradition of sharing \nknowledge and providing educational and training \nprogrammes for students and experts from all over the \nworld. In the past decades, hundreds of students from \noutside Hungary have obtained their medical degrees \nin our country. We are cooperating with various \ncountries, sharing knowledge and experiences in order \nto contribute to the collective efforts that need to be \nmade to bring about better health worldwide. \n The High-level Meeting gave momentum to this \nfight, which needs to be fought not only on an \n \n \n3 11-51191 \n \nindividual level by the victims of these diseases, but \nalso by our countries and by the international \ncommunity working together. We need to capitalize on \nthis in order to reach the ultimate goal of saving lives \naround the world and thereby move further towards \none of the founding objectives of the United Nations: \nhuman development. \n As members may know, Hungary has put forward \nits candidacy for Security Council membership in \n2012-2013. We continue to uphold the principles and \nobjectives enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations and international law, such as the equality of \nnations, the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect \nfor human rights. Hungary also stands ready to \ncontribute in a meaningful way to all efforts aimed at \nenhancing the capabilities of the United Nations in the \nfield of conflict prevention and mediation. We believe \nin an integrated approach to conflict resolution and will \nadvocate a stronger integration of security and \ndevelopment concerns, as well as enhanced interaction \nbetween the Council and other main organs of the \nUnited Nations. \n Let me conclude by assuring the Assembly once \nagain that Hungary will continue to contribute its \nutmost to strengthening the global cooperation of \ncountries within the United Nations system, which is \nso strongly needed to tackle today\u2019s challenges."

It gives me great \npleasure to congratulate the Secretary-General, His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his reappointment to \nthat high post for a second term. I also wish to \ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \nelection to the post of President of the General \nAssembly at the sixty-sixth session, and wish him \nfruitful work. \n In 2011, Uzbekistan has been celebrating a \nlandmark date in its modern history \u2014 the twentieth \nanniversary of independence. Only 20 years have \npassed since the Republic of Uzbekistan became an \nindependent State and joined the ranks of the fully \nfledged Members of the United Nations, having gained \nthe right to decide and build on its own present and \nfuture, but over that period Uzbekistan has made \nsignificant progress in building an independent State, \ndeveloping the national economy and modernizing the \ncountry. \n During those years, the Republic of Uzbekistan \nhas transformed itself from a sluggish raw materials-\nbased economy, with a destructive monoculture of \ncotton, an underdeveloped industrial and social \ninfrastructure and low-per-capita consumption, into a \nmodern country with a steadily developing economy. \n The following evidence clearly testifies to the \nfact that, over the past 20 years of independent \ndevelopment, Uzbekistan\u2019s economy has grown by a \nfactor of 3.5 and the population\u2019s total income has \nincreased by a factor of 20. Despite the negative \nimpact of the ongoing global financial and economic \ncrisis, Uzbekistan continues to develop at a steady \npace. Over the past five years, the growth in gross \ndomestic product (GDP) has averaged 8.5 per cent. \nThis year, it is expected that that level will be \nmaintained. \n Striking achievements have been made in \nimplementing the goals set out in the Millennium \nDeclaration. During the years of independence, State \nexpenditure in the social sector has increased more \nthan fivefold. About 60 per cent of the annual budget is \ndevoted to the development of health care, education, \ncommunal services, social welfare and other sectors. \nSome 82.5 per cent of the population has access to \nclean drinking water and 83.5 per cent to natural gas. \n I would like to underscore in particular the huge \nrole and significance in all those changes of education \n  \n \n11-51390 2 \n \nand people\u2019s increasing awareness. Annual expenditure \non education in Uzbekistan amounts to 10 to 12 per \ncent of GDP, whereas that indicator worldwide does \nnot exceed 3 to 5 per cent. An exceptional national \nprogramme to train skilled personnel and workers has \nbeen launched. From 2009, a mandatory 12-year \neducation programme was introduced. Uzbekistan has \nset up more than 1,600 modern vocational colleges and \nhigh schools. \n Such indicators, which are not often seen across \nthe world, clearly affirm that our most important goal \nis ensure the quality of life and protect the interests of \ncitizens. The Uzbek model for the country\u2019s \ndemocratization and transition to a socially oriented \nmarket economy, adopted in the early years of our \nindependence, has served as the basis for those \nachievements. \n Our country is steadily progressing towards \nachieving the goal we have set ourselves, namely, to \njoin the ranks of the modern, developed and \ndemocratic States and to ensure for its people a high \nstandard of living and a dignified place in the world \ncommunity. \n Today, we have every reason to affirm that we \nhave achieved the main goal, that is, the country\u2019s \nirreversible and steady reform and democratization. \nThe conceptual framework for further deepening the \ndemocratic reforms and establishing civil society in the \ncountry, developed by the President of Uzbekistan, \nIslam Karimov, in November 2010, provides for the \nfurther development and strengthening of Uzbekistan\u2019s \nlong-term sustainable development model. The \nconceptual framework calls for further democratization \nof State authority and governance, reforming the \njudicial system, establishing and developing civil \nsociety institutions, ensuring freedom of speech and \ninformation, developing the electoral law, further \ndeepening market reform and liberalizing the economy. \n In assessing the state of affairs in Central Asia, it \nis important to note that, given its geopolitical and \ngeostrategic significance and the very rich natural \nresources, the region continues to be the focus of the \ninternational community\u2019s attention in the context of \nthe growing threats and challenges to security and \nstability in the world. \n First, the war that has been under way in \nAfghanistan for more than 30 years continues to be the \nmain destabilizing factor, not only in the region but \nalso in the entire world. More unfortunately, the \nsituation remains tense despite all the measures now \nbeing taken by the international community. It is \nimportant to underscore, in particular, that today, \neveryone is sure that there is no military solution to the \nAfghan problem. Almost all leaders, including those \ninvolved in resolving the Afghan issue and the direct \nmilitary command of the coalition forces in \nAfghanistan, are of this view. \n We firmly believe that the Afghan people \nthemselves must resolve their country\u2019s problems. \nOnly through a compromise between the warring \nparties with the Afghans themselves being involved in \nthat process, as well as the socio-economic recovery of \nAfghanistan with the help of the international \ncommunity, will it be possible to find a way out of the \ncurrent deadlock in Afghanistan\u2019s situation.  \n President Karimov already stated that at the \nNATO Summit in Bucharest in April 2008. We see the \nfuture of Afghanistan as a peaceful and steadily \ndeveloping State that poses no threat to neighbouring \ncountries, such that the people living in the region can \nfully enjoy the benefits of friendly, mutually beneficial \nand equal relations. Uzbekistan will continue to pursue \na policy of good-neighbourliness and cooperation \ntowards Afghanistan on a bilateral basis, in accordance \nwith mutual national interests. \n Secondly, the tragic events in Kyrgyzstan in June \n2010 posed a serious challenge to peace and stability in \nthe Central Asian region. More than a year has passed \nsince those bloody events. However, to date no \npolitical or legal conclusions on all those forces and \nspecific individuals who ordered, organized and \nperpetrated the crimes have been drawn. Until such \ninvestigations are completed and the perpetrators, \nirrespective of their nationality, origin or position, are \npunished, it is difficult to envisage the restoration of \ntrust and cooperation between the Uzbek community \nand the Kyrgyz. \n Thirdly, the socio-economic development not \nonly of our country, but also of the entire Central Asian \nregion, is hampered by the ecological catastrophe of \nthe Aral Sea. In practically the span of one generation, \nit has changed from once being one of the most \nexceptional and most beautiful seas into a drying and \ndisappearing pool. Today, the Aral Sea basin faces a \nrange of ecological, socio-economic and demographic \nproblems of global consequences. The Secretary-\n \n \n3 11-51390 \n \nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, himself was convinced of \nthat while visiting the Aral Sea last year. \n In such circumstances, attempts to build huge \nhydropower facilities on the upper reaches of the Amu \nDarya and Syr Darya rivers are counterproductive and \ndangerous, since they pose serious threats to public \nsafety in terms both of environmental, social and \ntechnical risks and of preserving the volume and \ncourse of the river flow. \n In addressing such problems, we proceed on the \npremise that any use of transboundary watercourses \nmust take into account the interests of all States located \nin their basins, and should be carried out in accordance \nwith international law. I refer in particular to the \nConvention on the Protection and Use of \nTransboundary Watercourses and International Lakes \nof 17 March 1992 and the Convention on the Law of \nthe Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses of \n21 May 1997. \n We do not ignore the rights of the upstream \ncountries to develop their hydropower sector. In our \nview, this is a very important sector of the economy. \nHowever, it would be safer and more rational to build \ncascades of small hydropower plants with the same \ntotal production capacity. Our country\u2019s position is not \nonly fully consistent with relevant international law \nand accepted regulations, but it is also, and most \nimportantly, derived from them. \n In conclusion, Uzbekistan supports the theme \nproposed by the President of the General Assembly for \nthis session\u2019s general debate, namely, \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d. We fully share his view regarding the \nimportance of strengthening multilateral machinery so \nas to ensure a stable and just world order that is \ncapable of effectively responding to emerging threats \nto regional stability and international security. \n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour to \nagain address this Assembly, especially at the first \ngeneral debate ever opened by a woman. What an \ninspiration! This debate has already proven that the \nGeneral Assembly can indeed play a central role in \nmultilateral diplomacy, in particular at this time of \ngreat change and turmoil.  \n I would like to express the solidarity of my \ncountry, Liechtenstein, with all of the peoples of the \nworld that have, in recent months, sought to attain \nfreedom from oppression and tyranny. We admire the \ncourage of all of those women and men, young and old, \nwho have stood up for their rights, often at great \npersonal risk. We, the United Nations, must stand by \nthem. I also wish to welcome South Sudan as the \n193rd State Member of the Organization. The United \nNations has yet again proven its ability to settle \ncomplex and violent conflicts by peaceful means. \nThe developments in northern Africa and the \nMiddle East may have roots mainly in the lack of \nconnections between Governments and their people. \nWhile they may be primarily internal in nature, there is \nalso an international dimension to the rapid changes we \nare witnessing. The events since February have put the \nOrganization itself to the test, and more challenges can \nbe expected to occur.  \n In recent years we have sharpened tools and \nconcepts that are essential in helping us solve or \nprevent conflicts. So how did we apply them during \nthese challenging times?  \n First, how well did we carry out our commitment \nto protect civilians? The United Nations has made \nmuch progress in developing the concept of the \nresponsibility to protect. The concept has three pillars: \nin the first instance, the primary responsibility of the \nState concerned, and then the second pillar, according \nto which other States have a responsibility to assist in \nthe protection of civilians. In two recent instances, \nhowever, the international community has had to act \nunder the last and third pillar. We commend the \nSecurity Council for taking swift action to protect \ncivilians in Libya and in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. In both \ninstances, the Council authorized the use of force only \nas a last resort, but also without undue delay. \n Some have criticized the actions taken and argued \nthat they were aimed at regime change. Let us not \nforget, however, that the regimes in question had a \n  \n \n11-51398 2 \n \nchoice. It was they who chose to attack civilians. It was \nthey who forced the international community to act. At \nthe same time, we sympathize with those who \nperceived a selective application of the responsibility \nto protect. As the stalemate in the Security Council on \nSyria showed, politics continues, at times, to trump \nprinciple. In response, however, we need more \nprincipled action, not more politics. \n Secondly, have we lived up to our promise to \nensure accountability for the worst crimes? Have we \nlived up to the promise of \u201cNever again!\u201d, which we \ngave in the aftermath of Rwanda and Srebrenica? Once \nmore, the international response to crimes committed \nin Libya has provided a glimmer of hope. The Security \nCouncil\u2019s unanimous referral of the Libya situation to \nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) was a historic \ndecision. The ICC responded appropriately with swift \naction. Furthermore, the Court is also undertaking \npreliminary investigations regarding C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The \ncentral role played by the Court in those situations and \nin many others has illustrated the profound paradigm \nshift brought about by the Rome Statute.  \n The core principle of that shift is now firmly \nentrenched in the fabric of international law: there \nmust be accountability for genocide, war crimes and \ncrimes against humanity. But accountability has not yet \narrived everywhere that it is needed. Serious \nallegations of crimes committed in Sri Lanka and in \nSyria, for instance, have not yet found an appropriate \nand transparent justice mechanism. Again, the primary \nresponsibility to ensure an end to impunity falls on the \nStates concerned. International mechanisms, such as \nthe ICC, can and must only become active where States \nfail to live up to their responsibilities. \n Thirdly, how effective have we been in using \nmediation as a tool in the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes? This topic, which was rightfully chosen as \nthe central theme of the presidency, is at the very heart \nof the Organization\u2019s mandate. We support the \nSecretary-General\u2019s call to raise prevention from an \nabstract concept to a core operating principle. It is \nsimply paradoxical that only a small fraction of the \nSecretariat\u2019s resources is dedicated to mediation, while \nwe spend $7 billion per year on peacekeeping.  \n In many situations, the good offices provided by \nneutral and trusted actors, such as envoys of the \nSecretary-General, can make a real difference on the \nground. Such actions involve highly intense, often \nheroic efforts, which deserve much stronger support \nfrom us as Member States. Mediation efforts are \nincreasingly influenced by accountability mechanisms. \nThe General Assembly itself acknowledged this fact in \nits first ever resolution on strengthening mediation, \nwhere it emphasized, that \u201cjustice is a fundamental \nbuilding block of sustainable peace\u201d (resolution \n65/283, thirteenth preambular paragraph).  \n In this new age of accountability, mediators can \nnever offer amnesty from criminal prosecution or \nwithdraw arrest warrants issued by the ICC. That is not \nonly a matter of principle, but a matter of law. The ICC \nwould never be bound by such promises. At times, the \nimperatives of peace and justice may compete with \neach other temporarily and make the mediator\u2019s job \nmore difficult. Over the long run, however, they are not \nonly compatible, but mutually reinforcing. That \nmessage is sent around the globe upon each ratification \nof the Rome Statute. And we are particularly happy to \nnote that the message has been sent 118 times so far, \nmost recently by the Philippines and the Maldives. \n Fourthly, have we done enough to include women \nin efforts at conflict prevention and resolution and to \nmake them agents of change, instead of bystanders? \nHave we done enough to protect them during conflict, \nin particular, from sexual violence? We have \ncollectively sent strong signals in this regard. \nLiechtenstein particularly supports the Security \nCouncil\u2019s work on women, peace and security. We \nwelcome the new focus on the role of women brought \nabout by the creation of UN-Women. Women have \nbeen a driving force in the Arab Spring. But as some \ncountries transition to a new era, women risk being left \nbehind once again.  \n The United Nations is often involved in \ntransitional processes. It must ensure a strong role for \nwomen and apply a gender perspective. Most \nimportant, the United Nations must lead by example \nand appoint more women as leaders in mediation and \nother transitional processes. It was therefore with great \npleasure that I signed the joint statement on advancing \nwomen\u2019s political participation, earlier today. \n Regarding the protection of women and girls \nfrom sexual violence, we place high hopes in the new \nmonitoring and reporting mechanism. Expert teams \nwill help strengthen domestic accountability \nmechanisms. The greatest responsibility, however, lies \nwith peacekeepers on the ground. They are mandated \n \n \n3 11-51398 \n \nto go into harm\u2019s way and protect civilians. They must \nfulfil that mandate even more effectively when faced \nwith situations of sexual violence. Most important \nthough, we must once and for all eradicate all instances \nof sexual abuse committed by peacekeepers \nthemselves. It is not enough to simply repatriate Blue \nHelmet soldiers who have committed such crimes. Zero \ntolerance for sexual abuse must finally become a \nreality. \n Fifthly, have we done enough to address the root \ncauses of the unrest in many countries, including \npoverty, unemployment, corruption, lack of freedom \nand human rights? Those root causes and the strong \npopular opposition against them, remind us of a simple \ntruth: economic and social development are \ninextricably linked with good governance, human \nrights and the rule of law.  \n The international community has many tools at \nits disposal to assist countries in reforming their \nsystems of governance. We strongly support United \nNations activities to promote the rule of law and \ncombat corruption and make financial contributions to \nthat end. There is no shortage of assistance and \ncapacity-building programmes. What is needed is \ngreater political will to actually make use of them. It is, \nhowever, the task of the United Nations to improve the \nmanner in which rule-of-law assistance programmes \nare delivered and coordinated. We would welcome a \nstronger role for the Rule of Law Coordination and \nResource Group in this regard, and hope that progress \ncan be made at next year\u2019s high-level meeting on the \nrule of law. \n The events of recent months have shown us once \nagain how irresistible the call for freedom can be. And \nthey have shown us, once more, how indispensable the \nOrganization is when it comes to assisting peoples that \naspire to such freedom through democracy. Despite all \nthe criticism, I am convinced that the United Nations \nhas in recent years become more effective in delivering \non its mandate. If we work together here, we will \nachieve results much more efficiently than through \nindividual actions. Great opportunities lie ahead of \nus \u2014 let us accept the challenge."

        "file_text": "It is almost the end of \nthe beginning of the annual debate in United Nations. \nHaving listened to and evaluated positions on different \nworld issues debated by the planet and all of humanity, \nthe delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, \nthe South American Bolivarian Republic, has received \nfor the purposes of sharing with the Governments and \nthe brotherly peoples of the world through the General \nAssembly a letter from the president of our Republic, \nCommander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas. This letter contains a \nseries of comments and reflections that are necessary \nand relevant for a democratic debate in our world and, \nabove all, for the process of the growing empowerment \nof the peoples of the world and of transformation and \nnecessary re-establishment of the United Nations as a \nmultilateral system that has been with us for the last \nsix or seven decades. \n By your leave, Sir, I will read out and distribute \nto delegations the letter from Commander Hugo \nCh\u00e1vez: \n  \u201cCaracas, 26 September 2011 \n  \u201cI am writing these words to the United \nNations General Assembly, that great forum \nwhere representatives of all the peoples of the \nworld meet to express the reality of the \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela and to reaffirm \nour unwavering commitment to justice, equality \nand peace.  \n  \u201cPeace, peace, peace \u2026 let us not look for \npeace in cemeteries, as Kant said with irony, but \nrather through the most zealous respect for \ninternational law. Unfortunately, the United \nNations, throughout its history, instead of adding \nand multiplying efforts for peace among nations, \nhas ended up by supporting the most ruthless \ninjustices, sometimes by acts of commission, \nsometimes by acts of omission.  \n  \u201cWe need to recall the Preamble of the \nCharter of the United Nations, which talks of \nsaving future generations from the scourge of \nwar. Those are just empty words; since 1945, the \nnumber of wars has continued to grow \ninexorably. Let us look once again at Libya in \nruins, covered in blood, because of the powerful \npeople in this world.  \n  \u201cI call on the Governments of the world to \nconsider that since 11 September 2001, a new \n  \n \n11-51681 2 \n \nimperialist war was started, an unprecedented, \npermanent, perpetual war. \n  \u201cWe need to face the cruel reality of our \nworld. We must make a list of our concerns \nstemming from the dangers and threats that are \nstalking us. Why is the United States the only \ncountry that sows military bases all over the \nworld? What is it so afraid of that it must set \naside staggering budgets for constantly increasing \nits military strength? Why has it unleashed so \nmany wars, violating the sovereignty of other \ncountries, which have the same rights over their \nfutures? How can we can we use international \nlaw to counter its senseless ambition to militarily \ndominate the world in order to ensure access to \nthe energy sources it needs to sustain its \npredatory consumerist model? Why does the \nUnited Nations do nothing to stop Washington?  \n  \u201cIf we answer all of these questions with \nabsolute sincerity, we would understand that the \nempire has crowned itself judge of the world, \nwithout anyone bestowing that responsibility on \nit and even though, therefore, the imperialist war \nis a threat to us all.  \n  \u201cWashington knows that a multipolar world \nis already an irreversible reality. Its strategy \nconsists of halting the sustained rise of groups of \nemerging countries at any price, by promoting its \nmajor interests with its partners and followers in \norder to direct multi-polarity along the path that \nthe empire wants. What is more, the goal is to \nreconfigure the world so that it sustains Yankee \nmilitary hegemony. Humankind is facing a \ngenuine threat of permanent war. As the case of \nLibya shows, the empire is ready, in any scenario, \nto create the political conditions for going to war. \nIn the imperial worldview, Clausewitz\u2019s famous \naxiom is being reversed: politics is the \ncontinuation of war by other means. \n  \u201cWhat is behind this new Armageddon? It is \nthe absolute power of the military-financial \nleadership, destroying the world in its \naccumulation of more profits, a military-financial \nleadership that is in fact subordinate to a group of \nStates. It should be borne in mind that war is \nfinancial capital\u2019s way of life: war that ruins most \npeople and makes a few unimaginably rich. At \nthis moment we have a profoundly serious threat \nto global peace: the unleashing of a new cycle of \ncolonial wars, starting with Libya, with the \ncynical goal of breathing new life into the global \ncapitalist system, whose current structural crisis \nhas still in no way curbed its destructive, \nconsumerist voraciousness. The case of Libya \nshould alert us to the desire to practice a new \nimperial version of colonialism: military \ninterventionism endorsed by the anti-democratic \nbodies of the United Nations and justified by \nprefabricated lies. \n  \u201cHumankind is on the brink of an \nunimaginable catastrophe. The world is marching \ninexorably towards devastating ecocide; the \nterrifying consequences of global warming \nproclaim it, but the ideology of the environmental \nequivalents of Cort\u00e9s and Pizarro, the early \nSpanish colonizers who destroyed part of the \nAmerican continent \u2014 as the influential French \nthinker Edgar Morin has said \u2014 drives them to \ncontinue their depredations and destruction. The \nenergy and food crises worsen, while capitalism \nstill breaches every boundary with impunity. \n  \u201cAs we face this bleak prospect, our way is \nlighted by the great American scientist and two-\ntime Nobel prize winner, Linus Pauling, who \nsaid: \n   \u2018I believe that there is a greater power \nin the world than the evil power of military \nforce, of nuclear bombs \u2014 there is the \npower of good, of morality, of \nhumanitarianism. I believe in the power of \nthe human spirit\u2019. \n Then let us mobilize all the power of the human \nspirit; it is time. We must unleash a great political \ncounter-offensive to prevent the powers of \ndarkness finding justification for going to war, so \nthey can unleash the generalized global war with \nwhich they hope to save the West\u2019s capital. \nVenezuela calls for the establishment of a grand \nalliance against war and for peace, with the \nsupreme goal of avoiding war at all costs. The \nwarmongers and, especially, the military-\nfinancial leadership that sponsors and leads them \nmust be defeated politically. Let us build the \nbalanced universe envisioned by the liberator \nSim\u00f3n Bolivar, the balance that, as he said, \n \n \n3 11-51681 \n \ncannot be found in war; the balance born out of \npeace. \n  \u201cLet us take note and remember: Venezuela, \nalong with the member countries of the \nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \nAmerica, actively advocated for a peaceful and \nnegotiated solution to the Libyan conflict, as did \nthe African Union. Eventually, however, the logic \nof war decreed by the Security Council and made \na reality by NATO, the armed wing of the Yankee \nempire, was imposed, the logic of war whose \nvanguard is the transnational media. \n  \u201cLet us remember that the case of Libya \nwas brought before the Security Council on the \nbasis of intense propaganda on the part of the \nmedia, which lied in saying that the Libyan Air \nForce was bombing innocent civilians, not to \nmention the grotesque media setting of Tripoli\u2019s \nGreen Square. This premeditated campaign of lies \nwas used to justify hasty and irresponsible \ndecisions by the Security Council, paving the way \nfor NATO\u2019s policy of military regime change in \nLibya. It is worth asking: what became of the \nno-fly zone established by Security Council \nresolution 1973 (2011)? How could the more than \n20,000 NATO missions flown against Libya, \nmany of them aimed at bombing the Libyan \npeople, not represent the denial of the no-fly \nzone? Once the Libyan Air Force was completely \nannihilated, the continued \u2018humanitarian\u2019 \nbombing showed that the West, through NATO, is \nimposing its interests on North Africa, turning \nLibya into a colonial protectorate. \n  \u201cIt is a joke to say that the United Nations \nimposed an arms embargo on Libya, when NATO \nitself brought in thousands of heavy weapons in \nsupport of a violent insurrection against that \ncountry\u2019s legitimate Government. The embargo, \nof course, was there only to prevent the Libyan \nGovernment from defending its sovereignty, \nexposing yet again the functioning of the cruel \ninternational system, under which the law applies \nonly to the weak. \n  \u201cWhat is the real reason for this military \nintervention? To recolonize Libya so as to take \nover its wealth. We have no doubt about that. \nEverything else is subordinate to that goal. No \none colonizes innocently, as the great poet of \nMartinique, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, rightly said in his \nextraordinary essay on colonialism. By the way, \nthe residence of Venezuela\u2019s Ambassador in \nTripoli was invaded and looted while the United \nNations stayed mute, guarding a shameful \nsilence. \n  \u201cWe demand the immediate cessation of the \nbombing on Libyan territory. We will also \ncontinue demanding that international law be \nrespected in the case of this sister nation. We will \nnot remain silent in the face of evil intentions to \ndestroy the foundations that endow it with sense \nand reason. We therefore put this question to the \nAssembly: Why is the Libyan seat in the United \nNations granted to the so called National \nTransitional Council while Palestine\u2019s admission \nis blocked by ignoring not only its legitimate \naspiration, but also the will of the majority of the \nGeneral Assembly? With all its strength and with \nthe moral authority granted it by the will of the \nmajority of the world\u2019s peoples, Venezuela \nhereby affirms its unconditional solidarity with \nthe Palestinian people and its unlimited support \nfor the Palestinian national cause, including, of \ncourse, the immediate admission of Palestine to \nthe United Nations as a full Member State. \n  \u201cAnd the same imperialist formula is being \nrepeated in the case of Syria. Had not some of the \nSecurity Council\u2019s permanent members stood \nfirm, it would all have ended with the Council \nauthorizing NATO to fire its missiles and send its \nbombers against Syria. It is intolerable that the \nPowers of this world wish to arrogate to \nthemselves the right to order legitimate, \nsovereign rulers to resign on the spot. Having \nsucceeded in Libya, they wish to proceed in the \nsame way against Syria. Such are the current \nasymmetries that exist on the international scene, \nand such are the abuses done to independent \nnations. \n  \u201cIt is not for us to pass judgement on \nSyria\u2019s domestic situation, first, because of the \ninherent complexity of any national reality, and \nsecondly, because only the Syrian people can \nsolve their problems and decide their fate by the \nright to self-determination of all peoples, an \ninalienable right in every sense. But that does not \nprevent us from believing that it is 100 times \nbetter to bet on the success of the broad national \n  \n \n11-51681 4 \n \ndialogue for which President Basher Al-Assad \nhas called than to impose sanctions and howl like \nhyenas for military intervention. We fully support \nthe efforts of President Al-Assad to preserve the \nstability and unity of his country, which is being \nbesieged by the West.  \n  \u201cNow let us turn to the Horn of Africa, \nwhere we will witness a heartbreaking example \nof the United Nations\u2019 historic failure. Most \nserious news agencies report that 20,000 to \n29,000 children under the age of five have died in \nthe last three months. \n  \u201cThe journalist Frida Modak, in her article \n\u2018To Die In Somalia\u2019 reveals the miserliness that \nafflicts the major international organizations, first \namong them the United Nations, a level of \npoverty worse than that ravaging the vast region \nof the Horn of Africa. \n  \u201cIn order to confront this situation, we need \n$1.4 billion, not to solve the problem but to \naddress the emergency that Somalia, Kenya, \nDjibouti and Ethiopia are going through. \nAccording to all information received, the next \ntwo months will be decisive if we are to prevent \nthe death of more than 12 million people. That \nsituation is most acute in Somalia. \n  \u201cWe must also ask ourselves how much \nmoney is being spent on sophisticated weapons to \ndestroy Libya. Here is the answer of United \nStates Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who says, \n\u2018This new war will cost us $500 million during its \nfirst week alone. Obviously, we do not have \nfinancing resources for that and we will end up \ncutting off other important domestic programs\u2019 \nfunding\u2019. According to Mr. Kucinich himself, the \namount spent in northern Africa during the first \nthree weeks to massacre the Libyan people could \nhave been used to help the entire Horn of Africa, \nsaving dozens of thousands of lives. \n  \u201cThe reasons behind the criminal military \nengagement in Libya are not humanitarian at all. \nThey are based on the Malthusian postulate that \nthere are simply too many people in the world \nand that they have to be eliminated by generating \nmore hunger, destruction and uncertainty, thereby \ncreating more financial profits.  \n  \u201cIn this regard, it is frankly regrettable that \nthe opening address of the sixty-sixth session of \nthe General Assembly did not include an \nimmediate appeal to solve the humanitarian crisis \nin the Horn of Africa, even as it asserted that the \ntime had come to act on Syria. What criminal \ncynicism! \n  \u201cWe also call for an end to the shameful \ncriminal blockade against our sister republic of \nCuba, imposed by the United States empire for \nmore than 50 years with gruesome cruelty against \nthe heroic people of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. By 2010, a total \nof 19 separate votes in the General Assembly \narticulated the universal demand that the United \nStates cease its economic and trade blockade \nagainst Cuba.  \n  \u201cSince all arguments of international good \nsense have been exhausted, we have no choice \nbut to believe that such aggravated cruelty \nagainst the Cuban Revolution is the result of \nimperial arrogance in the face of the dignity and \ncourage shown by the defiant Cuban people in \ntheir sovereign decision to determine their own \nfate and fight for their happiness. \n  \u201cIn Venezuela, we believe that the time has \ncome to demand that the United States not only \nimmediately and unconditionally end the criminal \nblockade it has imposed against the Cuban \npeople, but that it also release the five Cuban \nanti-terrorist fighters held hostage in the prisons \nof the empire solely for seeking to prevent illegal \nactions that terrorist groups are preparing against \nCuba, under the protection of the Government of \nthe United States. \n  \u201cWe wish to reiterate that it is impossible to \nignore the crisis in the United Nations. In 2005, \nbefore this very General Assembly, we declared \nthat the model of the United Nations was \nobsolete. Back then, we also said that it needed to \nbe rebuilt from the ground up, and that the \nprocess could not be postponed. \n  \u201cSince then, nothing has been done. The \npolitical will of the most powerful has prevailed. \nOf course, the United Nations, as it continues to \nfunction, docilely serves their interests. If its \nSecretary-General, along with the President of the \nInternational Criminal Court, takes part in an act \nof war, as is the case with Libya, then nothing can \n \n \n5 11-51681 \n \nbe expected from the current structure of this \nOrganization, and there is no longer time for \nreform. The United Nations does not accept any \nreform whatsoever. The illness within it is fatal. \n  \u201cIt is unbearable that there is a Security \nCouncil that turns its back, whenever it wants to, \non the clamour of a majority of nations, \ndeliberately refusing to acknowledge the will of \nthe General Assembly. If the Security Council is a \nkind of club with privileged members, what can \nthe General Assembly do? What is the scope of \nits operation when its members violate \ninternational law? \n  \u201cParaphrasing the liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, \nwho was referring specifically, in 1818, to the \nthen newborn Yankee imperialism, we have had \nenough of laws being applied by the weak and \nabuses being committed by the strong. The \npeoples of the South cannot be the ones to respect \ninternational law, while the North violates, \ndestroys and plunders us. \n  \u201cIf we do not commit ourselves once and \nfor all to restructuring the United Nations, this \nOrganization will definitively lose its last shred \nof credibility. Its crisis of legitimacy is \naccelerating toward a final implosion. In fact, that \nis what happened to its immediate predecessor: \nthe League of Nations. \n  \u201cA crucial and decisive first step towards \nrestructuring the United Nations would be to \neliminate the category of permanent member \nalong with the right to veto in the Security \nCouncil. Likewise, the decision-making power of \nthe General Assembly must be democratically \nmaximized. A comprehensive review of the \nCharter of the United Nations is also urgently \nrequired, with the aim of drafting a new Charter. \n  \u201cThe future of a peaceful, multipolar world \ndepends on the determination of the majority of \nthe world\u2019s people to defend ourselves from the \nnew colonialism and to achieve a balance in the \nuniverse that will be capable of neutralizing \nimperialism and its arrogance. \n  \u201cThis broad, generous, respectful and \ninclusive call is addressed to all the peoples of \nthe world, but most especially to the emerging \nPowers of the South, which must courageously \nrise to the role they are being asked to play.  \n  \u201cFrom Latin America and the Caribbean, a \npowerful dynamic of regional alliances has \nemerged that seeks to create a democratic space \nthat will be respectful of differences and eager to \nemphasize solidarity and complementarity in \norder to maximize that which unites us and \nresolve politically whatever divides us.  \n  \u201cThis new regionalism allows for diversity \nand respects everyone\u2019s rhythms. The Bolivarian \nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America is \ngrowing into an experimental vanguard of \nprogressive and anti-imperialist Governments, \nseeking ways to break with the prevailing \ninternational order and strengthening the people\u2019s \ncapacity to confront the de facto Powers. \nHowever, that does not prevent its members from \ncontributing decisively and enthusiastically to the \nconsolidation of the Union of South American \nNations, a political bloc that federates \n12 sovereign States of South America into what \nthe liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar called \u2018a Nation of \nRepublics\u2019. Furthermore, the 33 countries that \ncomprise Latin America and the Caribbean are \ncurrently preparing to take the historic step of \nestablishing a single great regional entity that \nunites us all, without exception, through which \nwe will be able to design policies that will ensure \nour well-being, our independence and our \nsovereignty, based on equality, solidarity, and \nreciprocity.  \n  \u201cCaracas, the capital of the Bolivarian \nRepublic of Venezuela, is proud to be able to \nhost, on 2 and 3 December of this year, the \nsummit of heads of State and Government that \nwill definitely establish the Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States. \n  \u201cThe people of Venezuela have placed their \nhopes in a broad alliance of regional assemblies \nof the South, such as the Union of South \nAmerican Nations, the Caribbean Community, the \nCentral American Integration System, the African \nUnion, the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations and the Economic Cooperation \nOrganization, among other regional \norganizations, and specifically in interregional \ncoordinating bodies of emerging Powers such as \n  \n \n11-51681 6 \n \nthe BRICS group \u2014 consisting of Brazil, Russia, \nIndia, China and South Africa \u2014 which must \nbecome a focus of attention in coordination with \nthe peoples of the South. \n  \u201cI would like to conclude by recalling the \ngreat Venezuelan singer Ali Primera, whose \npoetic voice sent a message of life and revolution \nto our people. In one of his songs, he asks: what \nis man\u2019s struggle to achieve peace? And what \nkind of peace would it be, if we were to leave the \nworld as it is? Today more than ever, the worst \ncrime against peace would be to leave the world \nas it is; if we were to do so, the present and the \nfuture would be characterized by unending war. \nBringing about peace, on the other hand, requires \na radical rejection of everything that prevents \nhumankind from being human.\u201d"

        "file_text": "It is a \ngreat honour and a privilege for me to address this \nAssembly for the first time since I took office as \nPresident of the Union of the Comoros, on 26 May.  \n Allow me at the outset to warmly congratulate \nHis Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. I wish also to congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss and his entire team on \ntheir remarkable work. Lastly, I should like to pay a \nwell-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General, His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his commendable \nand unceasing efforts to ensure that our Organization \ncan better meet its objectives in a world increasingly \nmarked by all kinds of crises: political, economic, \nsocial and environmental. \n The Assembly is convening in its sixty-sixth \nsession at a time when all humankind is struggling \nthrough one of its most difficult times. Indeed, peace, \nthe most precious common good in the world, has \nnever been more threatened. It is under threat on all of \nour continents, in our regions, in our subregions and in \nevery one of our countries. It is threatened by political \ncrises, diseases and natural disasters. It is also \nthreatened by poor living conditions, unemployment, \ninsecurity and underdevelopment. \n The hotspots that have emerged in various \nregions of the world and the recent uprisings in North \nAfrica and the Middle East have claimed, and continue \nto claim, many victims. Our countries continue to be \nburdened by emerging diseases, but also and especially \nby non-communicable diseases. In fact, cancers, \ndiabetes and, in particular, cardiovascular diseases \nhave taken many lives in our countries and threaten \ntheir development.  \n The problem of education and the lack of basic \ninfrastructure, energy and potable water also pose a \nthreat to peace and security in many developing \ncountries. Moreover, no country today is safe from \nnatural disasters linked to climate change. This \nsituation is all the more tragic in small island \ndeveloping States such as mine. \n I need not mention the toxic effects of the \nfinancial crisis, which continues to affect our countries \nand seriously compromises the future of the global \neconomy. Therefore, I should like to issue an urgent \nappeal to the international community to enhance its \nrole in seeking rapid resolutions of all of these crises. \n Indeed, only by working together and effectively \nto fight disease will we be able to ensure that our \npopulations are healthy and our human resources are \nmore productive. By joining our efforts, we may also \ncurb unemployment through education and job creation \nand succeed in re-launching the socio-economic \ndevelopment of our countries. In addition, eradicating \ncorruption \u2014 which is increasingly rampant in our \ncountries \u2014 will help us succeed in re-launching \ndevelopment, which is an essential factor of peace and \nstability. Moreover, by strengthening the culture of \ndemocracy and rule of law, our countries will evolve \ntowards greater peace and stability, which are key \nconditions for sustainable development.  \n The President took the Chair.  \n We must further develop solidarity among the \nmember countries of this concert of nations. That must \nbe done to bring our world out of its vulnerable state. \nThe efforts of the developing countries in increasingly \ndifficult situations will not succeed without active \nsolidarity. The quasi-collective mobilization effort seen \ntoday in Europe and generally in the West to stem the \nfinancial crisis is most commendable. However, it must \nbe extended to other sectors and continents. Likewise, \nit is indeed appropriate to act swiftly and in unison to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, which \nhave inspired so much hope in our countries.  \n In this world in crisis, the Union of the Comoros \nhas for the second time experienced an exemplary, \npeaceful change at the top level of the State. However, \nits solid footing in democracy and good governance \nwill become truly irreversible only when poverty, \nmisery and vulnerability cease to exist. That is why we \nhave taken measures to fight corruption and to better \nuse our national resources and preserve and protect \nbiodiversity. Indeed, as a small island developing State \nthat is directly concerned, we attach very special \nattention to the question of climate change and the \nenvironment. We work every day to improve the \nstandard of living of our fellow citizens. But we also \nneed the support of the international community. \n In addition, and despite its difficult situation, my \ncountry will never set aside its responsibility to act \nwithin the international community. We intend to offer \nour modest contribution to mankind\u2019s quest for a better \nworld. Thus we take an active part in building peace \nand security by participating in the Eastern Africa \nStandby Brigade, in accordance with the requests of \n  \n \n11-51191 28 \n \nthe international community. While we are aware that \nour means are modest, we intend to play our role \nwithin the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \nOperation in Darfur, because promoting peace \nanywhere in the world, particularly in Africa, remains \nfor us a major imperative. \n Terrorism, piracy and other transborder organized \ncrime, including the trafficking of drugs and light \nweapons, are direct threats today to human security and \nto the national security of many countries. My country \nis doing its best to combat those scourges. But the \ninternational community must also provide greater \nassistance towards prevention, both structurally and \noperationally. Early warning mechanisms, exchanges \nof information and experiences, mutual assistance in \ntraining, organization and capacity-building will enable \nStates and regional organizations, particularly the \nAfrican Union, to enhance their capacities. \n Issues that have remained unresolved, sometimes \nfor decades, are sources of conflicts likely to \njeopardize the cause of peace and security. That is the \ncase in the question of Madagascar. The political crisis \naffecting the brotherly people of Madagascar deserves \nthe full attention of the international community. The \ncurrent efforts of the transitional Government, under \nthe aegis of the Southern African Development \nCommunity, call for multiform support from the \ninternational community so that that large island can \nfinally regain peace and security for the well-being of \nits people. \n The same is true with regard to the question of \nPalestine. The Comoros has always supported the \nstruggle of the brotherly Palestinian people and \nsupports the request of the Palestinian authorities to the \ninternational community for the recognition of a \nPalestinian State in its borders of June 1967, with East \nJerusalem as its capital. Indeed, for more than 30 years \nIsrael\u2019s occupation of Palestinian lands has remained \nan unresolved issue. As for my country, it supports that \nrecognition and appeals to all countries that love peace, \nfreedom and justice to do the same. \n The Union of the Comoros cannot have any other \nposition on that question, since it is directly concerned \nby another equally sensitive question that affects not \nonly its national unity, territorial integrity and history, \nand international law, but also peace in the Indian \nOcean region. Here I refer to the question of the \nComorian island of Mayotte.  \n Allow me to emphasize that the inclusion of the \nquestion of the Comorian island of Mayotte on the \nagenda of several sessions of the General Assembly \nand in relevant resolutions of the Assembly, the African \nUnion, the League of Arab States and the Organization \nof Islamic Cooperation has not yet provided a solution \nto this thorny question, which has placed us in \nopposition to France for decades.  \n As the Assembly is aware, the unilateral decision \nof France to make the Comorian island of Mayotte a \nd\u00e9partement is for us and for the international \ncommunity null and void and can in no way be \nconsidered a fait accompli. Furthermore, the visa \nregime imposed by the French authorities on \nComorians of the three other islands has broken up \nmany families by turning the sea channel that separates \nMayotte from its sister island Anjouan into a huge \ncemetery, where rest the remains of thousands of my \ncompatriots who only wished to gain access to a part of \ntheir territory. \n However, we cannot simply continue to condemn \nwithout any follow-up, or maintain fixed positions that \ndo not contribute to the settlement of the issue, while \nwe continue daily to witness many losses due to the \nvisa regime imposed by France. \n Therefore, I wish to reiterate from this rostrum \nmy country\u2019s legitimate determination to continue to \nclaim the reintegration of the Comorian island of \nMayotte as part of its natural grouping. However, we \nhope to be able to conduct this struggle by means of \nthe necessary negotiations with France \u2014 an economic \npartner of the Comoros \u2014 but also and above all \nthrough including our brothers and sisters in Mayotte, \nbecause there can be no realistic and lasting solution to \nthe dispute without their involvement. \n That is the new approach that I proposed as soon \nas I was inaugurated to settle the territorial conflict that \nhas divided my country and France for just over \n30 years. Indeed, I believe that any search for a \nsolution to this thorny problem must include our \nMahorais brothers and sisters, with whom we share ties \nknitted through history, blood, language, religion and \nculture. We believe that the large Comorian diaspora in \nFrance and the island of R\u00e9union can join with its \nbrothers and sisters of Mayotte and the other three \nComorian islands in order finally to renew their natural \nbonds, carry out projects and live out their common \ndestiny in harmony. \n \n \n29 11-51191 \n \n In this light, and in our desire to see this problem \u2014 \nwhich has lasted too long \u2014 be finally settled \nfavourably and peacefully, that we hope to promote the \nnegotiations with France and our Mahorais brothers \nand sisters that we believe to be essential.  \n Speaking of territorial integrity, I would like to \nmake particular mention of countries that occupy a \nspecial place in Comorians\u2019 hearts. For the Kingdom of \nMorocco, a brother country whose legitimate positions \non the Western Sahara my country has always \nsupported, I hope that the dialogue being held under \nthe auspices of the United Nations will quickly lead to \na peaceful solution to the problem. To the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, that great country and friend to the \nComoros, we here reaffirm our unfailing support for it \nin its legitimate struggle for one China, developing in \npeace and prosperity. \n I cannot speak of justice and equity without \nbringing up the need for internal reform of our \nOrganization, particularly the Security Council. We \nbelieve that only better representation of every \ncontinent on the Council, including the essential \nAfrican presence as a permanent member, can ensure \nbetter cohesion within the international community and \nthus do away with frustration and antagonism. \n In conclusion, I would like to thank all the \nfriendly countries and the regional and international \norganizations that continue to support us in multiple \nways in our efforts to re-launch our country\u2019s \nsocio-economic development. In particular, I thank \nQatar, which hosted the conference on assistance in \ninvestment and development in the Comoros, the \ncommitments for which have begun to materialize, \nthanks to the untiring efforts of high-level Qatari \nauthorities. I would also like to thank the American \nAdministration for its kind efforts to make our stay in \nthis great and beautiful country enjoyable."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to be \nhere to read the statement of my President, His \nExcellency H\u00e2mid Karzai, who had to return from New \nYork to Kabul on an urgent basis, following the tragic \nassassination, through a terrorist plot, of Afghanistan\u2019s \nformer President and Chairman of the High Peace \nCouncil, Mr. Burhanuddin Rabbani. \n The President\u2019s message begins:  \n  \u201cIt is a great honour to address the General \nAssembly at this year\u2019s session, although I regret \nthat I am unable to do so in person. I was here in \nNew York the day before yesterday and had \nlooked forward to attending this important \nsession of the Assembly. I had to return to Kabul \nafter the tragic news of the martyrdom of former \nPresident and Chairman of the Afghan High \nPeace Council, Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani. \nHe was assassinated in a cowardly terrorist plot \nby the enemies of peace in our country. \n  \u201cAs I speak, the Afghan nation is mourning \nthe loss not only of a valued and deeply respected \nnational figure, but a champion of peace who \nworked tirelessly, up to the last moment of his \ndistinguished life, for peace in his country. On \nbehalf of the Afghan people, I am grateful for the \nmessages of condolences expressed by leaders \naround the world at this terrible national loss in \nAfghanistan. \n  \u201cAs the single largest gathering of nations, \nthe Assembly is the highest manifestation of the \nplurality of our world. It is also the most solemn \nopportunity we have, once a year, to bring to \nglobal attention our national concerns and to \nissues that are, in our view, of concern to the \nwider world. \n  \u201cOver the past year, the world saw not only \npolitical volatility of historic proportions in the \nMiddle East, but also an unabated global \neconomic crisis, huge increases in the prices of \nfood and energy and enormous devastation \nwrought by natural disasters. Most countries \naround the world have seen aggravated conditions \nof life for their peoples, and for many others the \nfuture looks continuously bleak. In short, we live \nin times of uncertainty and crisis, and it is at \ntimes like these that international cooperation \ngains true relevance and meaning. \n  \u201cTen days ago, this very city marked the \ntenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. On \nbehalf of the people of Afghanistan, who have \nexperienced the scourge of terrorism in its worst \nimaginable form, I pay homage and respect to the \nmemory of the 9/11 tragedy and commiserate \nwith the people of the United States for their \nsense of loss, which this anniversary has \nrekindled. \n  \u201cOn this occasion, I urge the Assembly to \nalso reflect on the millions of lives around the \nworld that were touched by terror and violence \nbefore 9/11 and those that have been lost to \nterrorist violence over the 10 years since.  \n  \u201cMy country, Afghanistan, has suffered the \nmost, but many \u2014 from Pakistan to India, Iraq, \nEurope and many others around the world \u2014 \nhave fallen victim to this modern-day enemy of \npeace. I urge the Assembly to also honour the \nsacrifices many nations have made in the fight \nagainst terrorism around the world. Above all, \nhowever, I ask that we pause and take stock of \nwhere we are 10 years after the world was shaken \ninto an unprecedented resolve to act in the face of \na common enemy. \n  \u201cLater this year, Afghanistan will also mark \nthe anniversary of 10 years of the new political \nera heralded by the end of the Taliban rule and \ncharacterized by the beginning of a journey \ntowards a peaceful, prosperous and democratic \nway of life. There is so much that we have to \ncelebrate in the enormous achievements we have \nhad, with the solidarity and generous help of the \ninternational community. These 10 years have \nbeen a truly unique chapter in the history of our \nancient country.  \n  \u201cGrasping the opportunity, we took bold \nsteps to reunite the country after decades of strife \nand violence, laying the foundations of a young \ndemocracy. Our social and economic \naccomplishments are phenomenal, greater by \ncomparison than in any other period in our \ncountry\u2019s history. Never before have the Afghan \npeople enjoyed comparable access to education \nand health or seen a greater development of \ninfrastructure across the country. \n  \n \n11-51179 6 \n \n  \u201cRegrettably, the sense of gratitude and \npride we feel at our achievements is tempered by \nthe absence of a key ingredient of any country\u2019s \ndevelopment, namely security. Despite the \nAfghan people\u2019s sincere embrace of the \ninternational fight against terrorism and the \nimmeasurable sacrifices made on this path, we \nhave yet to reap the rewards of experiencing a life \nfree from violence and terror. \n  \u201cWe Afghans are proud to have partnered, \nover the past 10 years, with the world\u2019s struggle \nagainst terrorism. While together we have fought \nand crushed extremists in some of their long-held \nstrongholds, elsewhere they have continued to \nthrive. Today, we see a worrying trend towards \nincreased radicalization of the youth. Al-Qaida, \ndespite the elimination of its leaders, remains \nactive in the region, and the Taliban militancy \nmaintains its deadly spectre over my country. \nBoth continue to receive sanctuary and support in \nthe region, which keeps them alive. This \nsanctuary problem is, without a doubt, the \nAchilles\u2019 heel of this war.  \n  \u201cTo the extent that international terrorism \nand extremism remain real threats to international \nsecurity, peace will remain mortgaged to the \nsuccess of the fight in the region. To succeed, \nhowever, we must fundamentally review and \nadjust our approaches in this fight. It is urgent \nthat we focus our strategy to make our collective \nstruggle more objective and results-oriented. Our \nenemy must not be defined by a selective \ntreatment of the geography to which we have \naccess, but by an assessment of the threat it \nposes, regardless of where it may be based. \n  \u201cThe Afghan people remain ardent \nsupporters of the fight against international \nterrorism, despite having suffered unspeakable \nlosses in this endeavour. However, we fail to see \nthe efficacy of the fight in which ordinary \ncitizens bear the brunt while terrorist sanctuaries \nremain untouched, far away from the towns and \nvillages of Afghanistan. The continued credibility \nof the fight will depend above all on taking its \nfocus to where terrorism originates. \n  \u201cOn the other hand, when it comes to the \nTaliban insurgency, we do not see military action \nas the only solution. In our eager quest for \nrestoring peace to the lives of our people, we \nhave extended a hand of peace and reconciliation \nto all those Afghans who have had reason to \nremain outside the boundaries of the current \npolitical process in Afghanistan. \n  \u201cLed until now by the late Mr. Rabbani, \nwho is tragically no longer among us, through the \nHigh Peace Council, and supported by our \npartners from the international community, the \npeace process is a comprehensive effort. It covers \nthe reintegration of armed combatants into \ndignified civilian life and reconciles the \nleadership of the Taliban. \n  \u201cThe reconciliation policy is based on our \ncommitment to make the political process more \ninclusive and to provide a genuine and acceptable \nalternative to violence for all Taliban and other \nmilitant leaders, most of whom are currently \nbased outside Afghanistan. Those leaders are \nwelcome to return home and play their proper \nrole in Afghan politics and Government \u2014 \nprovided that they break ties with Al-Qaida, give \nup violent activities and accept the Afghan \nConstitution. Clearly, without sincere cooperation \nfrom regional and international partners, notably \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, this strategy \nwill not succeed. \n  \u201cThe year 2011 is a crucial year for \nAfghanistan. The most important development for \nour country was the commencement of the \ntransition process last July. This process will see \nthe complete transfer of security responsibility \nfrom international forces to Afghans by the end of \n2014. With the completion of the transition \nprocess, we Afghans and our international \npartners will achieve the most important strategic \ngoal of our 10-year partnership: the emergence of \na sovereign Afghanistan that is self-reliant and is \nthe peaceful home of all Afghans, an Afghanistan \nthat is at peace and lives in peace with the rest of \nthe world. \n  \u201cNeedless to say, the success of the \ntransition process depends on, besides the \ndemand and solid resolve of the Afghan people, \nthe continued support of the international \ncommunity. The role of our NATO partners, \nparticularly in terms of the capacity development \nof our security institutions, will be vital. \n \n \n7 11-51179 \n \n  \u201cOn the other hand, transition is not just \nlimited to security. Indeed, while transition is \nboth desirable and inevitable, the economic effect \nof the withdrawal of foreign forces from \nAfghanistan needs to be managed carefully. In \nother words, for Afghanistan to become truly self-\nreliant, apart from the security transition, we will \nneed a comprehensive economic transition. That \ntransition will take much longer than the security \ntransition and will require the continuation of \nsteadfast support on the part of our international \npartners beyond 2014. \n  \u201cIn this context, we look forward to the \nmuch awaited International Conference on \nAfghanistan, to be held in Bonn, Germany, on \n5 December 2011. Hosted by Germany and \nchaired by Afghanistan, the Bonn conference will \nbe an opportunity for us to brief our international \npartners about the major Compact accomplishments \nof the past 10 years, and in particular about the \nprogress of the Transition and reconciliation \nprocesses. \n  \u201cMost importantly, at Bonn we will call for \ncontinued commitment of the international \ncommunity to assist Afghanistan in the post-2014 \nperiod, after the foreign military presence on \nAfghanistan soil comes to an end. To that end, we \nwill share our vision for the next 10 years \u2014 the \nvision of developing Afghanistan into a stable \ncountry, a functioning democracy and a \nprospering economy. As a country at the centre of \nan emerging \u2018new silk road\u2019, Afghanistan can \nbecome a regional hub for trade and transit. This \nvision is worth all the efforts we Afghans can \nmuster, as well as all the support we can get from \nthe international community. \n  \u201cAs a framework for long-term partnership, \nwe will call for a new paradigm of cooperation \nbetween Afghanistan and our friends and \npartners. The strategic partnership that we are \ncurrently negotiating with the United States and \nother partners, including the European Union, \nwill be a model for the kind of enduring and \ncomprehensive partnership we wish to have with \nmembers of the international community. Such \npartnerships will help guarantee Afghanistan\u2019s \nsecurity and stability, as well as assist our future \neconomic development. I emphasize that neither \nour strategic partnership with the United States, \nnor any other partnerships we will forge in the \nfuture, will be a threat to our neighbours or to any \nother country. \n  \u201cI also emphasize that in the context of \nthese future partnerships, the principle of Afghan \nsovereignty and the centrality of the Afghan State \nmust be given due credence; the manner of our \ncontinued partnership should conform to the \nrequirements of a sovereign Afghanistan. As an \nimportant step in this direction, all the parallel \nstructures created by the international community, \nbe it in the security, governance or development \narenas, must be removed to make space for the \nemergence of genuine and capable indigenous \ninstitutions. \n  \u201cIn particular, the role of the United Nations \nin Afghanistan must be adjusted to the \nrequirements of Afghan sovereignty. I welcome \nthe review of the mandate of the United Nations \nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan, as authorized \nby the Secretary-General. In the months ahead, \nwe look forward to participating in this review \nand to its positive conclusion. \n  \u201cOn the subject of regional cooperation, we \nare currently working closely with Afghanistan\u2019s \nold friend and brother, the Republic of Turkey, \ntowards a regional conference to be held in \nIstanbul on 2 November 2011. Hosted by Turkey \nand championed by Afghanistan, the Istanbul \nConference will help build a common regional \nvision for peace and stability. The Conference \nwill recognize Afghanistan\u2019s quest for stability, as \nwell as the region\u2019s growing need for confidence-\nbuilding and cooperation in the face of the \ncommon challenges we face, notably terrorism, \nextremism, the drug trade and obstacles to \nlegitimate interaction and movement, to name but \na few. \n  \u201cOver the past 10 years, we have \nundertaken numerous initiatives to promote \nregional cooperation, mainly with a view to trade \nand economic activities. However, we have \nlearned that unless we boldly address our political \ndifferences and the deficit of trust and confidence \nthat divides the region, regional cooperation will \nremain an aspiration. It is for that very reason that \nat the Istanbul Conference we will aim to focus \non political and security issues. \n  \n \n11-51179 8 \n \n  \u201cIn the coming weeks, we will expect to \nconsult with all countries in the Heart of Asia \nregion to develop a common understanding in the \nrun-up to the Conference. \n  \u201cIn today\u2019s interconnected world, \ndevelopments in Afghanistan and the surrounding \nregion are hugely influenced by events in the \nwider world. Therefore, we in Afghanistan are \nclosely watching the situation in the Middle East. \nAs a nation that has experienced war and \ndestruction for many years, the eruption of \nviolence in these countries fills us with anxiety. \nWe are particularly concerned by the \ndevelopments in Libya. We recognize the \nNational Transitional Council as the legitimate \nGovernment of Libya. However, based on our \nown experience, we urge the brotherly Libyan \nnation to recall that the shortest route to peace \nwill be through ensuring inclusivity and \nsafeguarding the unity of the Libyan nation. \n  \u201cThe people of Afghanistan deeply \nsympathize with the plight of our brothers and \nsisters in Palestine. We reiterate our call for an \nimmediate end to their suffering and the \nrealization of their inalienable rights, including \nthe right to an independent State. In this \nconnection, we stand firmly behind the efforts \naimed at Palestine\u2019s admission as a full Member  \n \n of the United Nations. I hope that this year we \nwill witness, with pride, the inclusion of Palestine \nas the 194th Member of the United Nations. \n  \u201cThe Afghan people also shared the pain of \nthe loss experienced by the Japanese people when \nthe natural disasters struck earlier this year. Japan \nis a longstanding friend of Afghanistan, and we \nare confident that this great nation will soon \novercome the challenges of recovery. \n  \u201cThe Assembly is a manifestation of our \ncollective will to stand together against the \nchallenges that face human society and to realize \nthe potential for a peaceful and prosperous world \nfor all. Our gathering here is also a testimony to \nthe valuable role that the United Nations plays in \nthe realization of our collective will. I applaud \nthe remarkable leadership that Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon has demonstrated in steering the \nUnited Nations in a direction where it can truly \nbecome an asset to a peaceful world. \n  \u201cFinally, many countries from across the \nglobe have stood in solidarity, over the past \n10 years, with the Afghan people. On behalf of \nthe people of Afghanistan, I again thank them for \ntheir support.\u201d"

        "file_text": "It is a great \nhonour and privilege to take part in the general debate \nand to represent my country on this rostrum at a \nsignificant juncture in Moldova\u2019s modern history, the \nrecent celebration of the twentieth anniversary of its \nindependence and 20 years of its membership in the \nUnited Nations, which we will mark in a few months. \nThese interrelated and complementary events \nconstitute an excellent opportunity to once again \nexpress our genuine attachment to the founding \nprinciples of the Organization, and our sincere \nappreciation for the support and assistance the \ninternational community has given my country during \nthis time. \n On behalf of my delegation, I have the pleasure \nto extend congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on assuming his high and \nresponsible position, and to join previous speakers in \nexpressing our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Joseph \nDeiss for his excellent management and the \ncompetence he displayed during his presidency of the \nAssembly. I would also like to reiterate our sincere \ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on \nhis reappointment to a second term as Secretary-\nGeneral, to convey our deep appreciation for his \nstrenuous efforts and activity on behalf of the \ninternational community and to wish him success in \ncontinuing his noble mission. \n The beginning of a new decade of the twenty-first \ncentury has been marked by major changes, sincere \naspirations and high hopes in many parts of our planet. \nWe wholeheartedly welcome the Republic of South \nSudan\u2019s declaration of independence and its entry into \nthe United Nations as the 193rd Member State. We \nhave witnessed the genuine desire of young people for \ndemocratic reforms and human rights, fundamental \nfreedoms and social justice. Peoples in the \nMediterranean region and in North Africa and the \nMiddle East have set out firmly along the road of \ndemocracy, launching the Arab Spring. In that regard, \nwe recall the events that changed Moldova and \nlaunched our country on a new, more democratic track \nin 2009. \n In this time of change and historical upheaval, we \nnote the transition of Libya to a new phase in its \n \n \n25 11-51681 \n \npolitical development, as stated expressively in the \nAssembly last week by the Chairman of the National \nTransitional Council Executive Office of Libya (see \n), whom the Republic of Moldova, like \nmany other delegations, supported as Libya\u2019s \nrepresentative in the General Assembly. The role of the \nUnited Nations in supporting Libya\u2019s transition to \ndemocracy in the wake of the downfall of the former \nregime has been incremental. We express our \nsatisfaction at the Security Council\u2019s approval of the \ncreation of a mission to assist the transitional \nauthorities and the Libyan people during the critical \npost-conflict phase. \n We have also learned that natural calamities hit \nnations indiscriminately. In order to overcome the \nconsequences of ecological disasters, such as the great \neast Japan earthquake, the Fukushima nuclear accident, \nthe great flooding in Pakistan and the severe drought \nand hunger in the Horn of Africa, requires the common \nefforts of both developed and developing States. The \ninternational community has the great task of \nstrengthening its humanitarian and disaster response \ncapabilities. \n Faced by different challenges, it is commendable \nto have a joint platform of concerted actions, managed \nby the United Nations. Poverty, conflicts, climate \nchange, economic and financial issues, migration, \npandemics, terrorism, international crime and other \ncrises affecting humankind cannot be countered \nindividually, but only by means of global strategies. \nThe United Nations is a unique tool in addressing and \novercoming them. \n The United Nations should consolidate its central \nrole in world affairs, and, consequently, enhance its \nmultilateral and universal potential by making the \nOrganization stronger and more representative, \nefficient and able to promptly react to major \nchallenges. A reformed Organization must \npragmatically adapt to new realities and strengthen its \ninfluence, in strict accordance with the United Nations \nCharter. The most appropriate methods of \ncommunication, consultation and cooperation during \nthe reform process should be developed, in close \ninteraction with other actors, such as the private sector, \ncivil society and academics, who play a more visible \nrole in shaping the modern world. \n The greatest incentive for economic growth and \nsecurity is a balanced and equitable global trade \nsystem, for which the international community has \nbeen struggling in complex negotiations since the Doha \nRound in 2001. While talks on the issue continue, \ndiscrepancies and ruptures in our economies make it \ndifficult to stand against the waves of the economic \nand financial crises. It is hardly possible that countries, \nespecially developing ones, remain immune to the \nglobalized economic downturn. While we are required \nto implement drastic austerity measures, access to \nmarkets is vital for our economies. That is one of my \ncountry\u2019s priorities. Our Government is working hard \ntowards the extension and diversification of market \noutlets in cooperation with its partners, primarily in \nEurope. We rely on openness, a constructive approach \nand fair play in market relations as our best allies for \nwin-win solutions in global trade. \n The Republic of Moldova stands committed to its \nhuman rights agenda. Last year, my country ratified the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \nand the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \nCourt, in a sustained effort to contribute to the \ndevelopment and implementation of international \nstandards in the fields of human rights and the rule of \nlaw. \n As a member of the Human Rights Council, \nMoldova has taken an active part in the Council\u2019s \ndeliberations and activities, with the aim of building up \na strong and legitimate human rights body. This year, \nMember States underwent the complex process of the \nCouncil\u2019s review. Although not all the concerns of \nMember States were accommodated for a far-reaching \nand more ambitious outcome of the review, we should \nremain committed to fulfilling the balanced and \nobjective agenda of the Council, while its membership \nis expected to comply with resolution 60/251 to uphold \nthe highest standards in the field of human rights and \nto fully cooperate with the Council\u2019s mechanisms. \n The Republic of Moldova remains committed to \nthat principle. In approximately two weeks, my country \nwill engage in an intensive review by the United \nNations Human Rights Council under the universal \nperiodic review mechanism, involving not only the \nGovernment but also civil society and other national \nstakeholders. We intend to proceed in that exercise \nwith genuine openness, objectivity and a constructive \napproach. \n The commemoration of the tenth anniversary of \nthe terrorist attacks in New York on 11 September 2001 \n  \n \n11-51681 26 \n \nreminded us once again of the great losses, the needed \nvigilance and the imperative to multiply our efforts in \ncombating the terrible scourge of terrorism. \n As a State party to all the universal legal \ninstruments on the prevention of terrorist acts, the \nRepublic of Moldova condemns terrorism and \nextremism in all their aspects, and welcomes the \nachievements of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy. We advocate the earliest conclusion \nof the negotiations of the comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism, the convening of a United \nNations conference and the strengthening of all efforts \non combating terrorism at the national, regional and \nglobal levels. To contribute to that end, the Republic of \nMoldova is currently hosting a regional event on \npreventing and countering the financing of terrorism in \nSouth-East European States. \n Let me now refer to one of the most important \nsecurity issues faced by the Republic of Moldova \u2014 \nthe Transnistrian conflict. From the outset, I would like \nto reconfirm that the Government of the Republic of \nMoldova remains fully committed to the goal of \nachieving a political, comprehensive and viable \nsolution to the issue, which should lead to the \nreintegration of my country. \n During the past five years, in referring to the \nTransnistrian issue, we have always made the same \nappeal. Moldova calls for the unconditional resumption \nof the negotiations on the political settlement of the \nconflict in the \u201c5+2\u201d format. I am happy to announce \nthat, exactly five days ago, at the 5+2 consultations \nround in Moscow, that decision was finally taken. We \nexpress our gratitude to the Russian Federation, the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nUkraine, the European Union and the United States \u2014 \nthe members of the 5+2 negotiations format \u2014 for \ntheir efforts in reaching that result. However, the \nresumption of the official negotiations was never seen \nas a goal in itself. We are fully aware that the most \ndifficult part of resolving the conflict is still ahead. \n On this occasion, I would like to reiterate some \nbasic elements of the Moldovan approach towards the \nproblem. A viable and comprehensive political solution \ncan be based only on respect for the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, within \nits internationally recognized borders. The central \nquestion on the agenda of the five plus two \nnegotiations should be the special status of the \nTransnistrian region within Moldova. On the one hand, \nthat special status should ensure full respect of the \nneeds, rights and freedoms of the local population. On \nthe other hand, it should provide for the functional \nintegration of the region with the rest of the country. \n Over the past year, our efforts have been focused \non mobilizing internal resources and international \nsupport to advance the conflict resolution process. In \nthat regard, we continue to promote confidence-\nbuilding measures between both banks of the Nistru \nRiver. Our current list of priorities includes the \nrestoration of fully-fledged rail communications \nthroughout the Transnistrian region, in accordance with \ninternational standards. Another important objective is \nthe restoration of landline phone connections to allow \npeople from the Transnistrian region to communicate \nfreely with their relatives and friends in the rest of \nMoldova.  \n The main beneficiaries of such measures are, \nobviously, the population and the business community. \nThe solutions are on the table. Our message for the \nleadership in Tiraspol is clear \u2014 abandon the policy of \nself-isolation and let us think together about practical \nand transparent solutions that would make people\u2019s \nlives much easier. \n Let me also refer to some unresolved issues that \nneed further attention. We are concerned about the \nsituation of Latin-script schools in the Transnistrian \nregion, which remain under constant pressure from \nlocal authorities. Children should never become \nhostages of political disagreements. In the same \ncontext, we emphasize the need to improve the human \nrights situation in the region, in particular to resolve \nthe case of Mr. Ilie Cazac, who has been abusively \nimprisoned in Tiraspol, in order to secure his \nimmediate and unconditional release. \n We need to reflect on the future of the existing \npeacekeeping arrangements in Moldova. I would like \nto underline the fact that Moldova has been at peace \nfor the past 19 years. Therefore, what we really need is \na peace consolidation, not peacekeeping, exercise. That \nrequires the transformation of the existing, old-\nfashioned military mechanism into a multinational \ncivilian mission operating under a relevant \ninternational mandate and focusing on confidence-\nbuilding activities. \n We should not avoid discussions about the \npresence of foreign military forces that are stationed on \n \n \n27 11-51681 \n \nMoldovan soil without the consent of the host country, \nin breach of the Moldovan Constitution and relevant \ninternational commitments. We are confident that an \nearly completion of the withdrawal of foreign \nmunitions stocks and the armed forces guarding them \nfrom the territory of the Republic of Moldova will \npositively influence the process of settling the \nTransnistrian problem. \n As in the case of other conflicts, the Transnistrian \nsettlement process cannot advance to its final goal \nwithout wide international support, particularly from \nthe mediators and observers. It is our strong belief that \ngenuine mediation based on shared objectives, joint \nefforts and good faith is an essential factor in that \nregard. \n We fully concur with the President\u2019s focus on the \npeaceful settlement of disputes, and his assessment that \npeaceful settlements, including those brokered through \nmediation efforts, provide the most cost-effective and \nlong-lasting solutions. We will actively engage in \nfurther debate on the role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes, with a view to developing and \nconsolidating the role of the General Assembly as the \nworld\u2019s leading peacemaker. \n Moldova\u2019s advancement on the path to European \nintegration, the primary goal of which is the overall \nmodernization of the country, remains the absolute \npriority of the domestic and external policies of the \nRepublic of Moldova. The Government has initiated a \nseries of deep reforms to ensure the rule of law, the \nindependence of justice and a functional market \neconomy where businesses and foreign investments can \nfind a proper place to grow. Those have proven to be \ncomplex, lengthy and sometimes painful processes, but \nthey are absolutely indispensable for further \ndevelopment. \n Moldova\u2019s proactive attitude and determination in \npromoting and implementing reforms has ensured a \nmore intense and expanded political dialogue between \nthe European Union (EU) and Moldova. We have made \nsignificant progress in negotiating an association \nagreement with the European Union by opening a \nstructured dialogue on human rights and fully engaging \nin efforts to meet the conditions established during the \nvisa liberalization dialogue. We are ready to launch \nnegotiations on creating a broad and comprehensive \nfree trade area with the European Union. \n The European perspective continues to be the \nEU\u2019s most effective tool in promoting dynamic and \nconsistent reforms in neighbouring countries. We are \nconfident that the promotion of democratic values, \nprosperity, stability and security in Europe will lay the \nfoundation for the future EU agenda. That projection of \nsoft power will be possible only if it is accompanied by \nan extension of EU borders. In that context, we hope \nthat the Warsaw Eastern Partnership Summit will make \nan important contribution to strengthening EU relations \nwith partner countries, developing its messages and \nleaving the door open for those Eastern European \nneighbours that are able to meet the accession criteria \nin the foreseeable future. \n Over the past 20 years, my country has achieved \nsignificant positive developments in the field of \ninternal affairs. Still, much remains to be done in the \nprocess of carrying out democratic and socio-economic \nreforms, the main objective of which is to consolidate \nthe Republic of Moldova as a sovereign, independent \nand reintegrated European State. \n In that regard, we further count on the support of \nthe United Nations and its Member states in advancing \nthe political and economic development of my country, \nresolving the Transnistrian conflict, speeding up the \nwithdrawal of foreign military forces and \nimplementing our development priorities. \n In conclusion, I would like to reconfirm the \ncommitment of the Republic of Moldova to the ideals \nand goals of the United Nations, and its readiness to \nfurther cooperate broadly by engaging in concrete \nactions to bring those ideas and aspirations to life."

        "file_text": "Allow me to join previous \nspeakers in congratulating Ambassador Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We \nwelcome his efforts to promote the goals of the United \nNations and to act as a bridge between the developed \nand the developing world. We pledge our full support \nand cooperation as he steers the work of this session. \n I would also like to thank Mr. Joseph Deiss for \nhaving guided us with much efficiency through the \nproceedings of the past session. We wish him well in \nhis future endeavours. To Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, who has been elected once again at the helm \nof our Organization, we continue to extend our support \nand cooperation. \n We welcome our newest Member State, the \nRepublic of South Sudan, to the family of nations. \n The United Nations was founded on the \nfundamental belief that collective action can serve our \ncollective security. That steadfast principle is even \nmore essential in addressing the many challenges that \nthreaten world peace today. In Ambassador Al-Nasser\u2019s \ninaugural statement as President, he referred to the \nenormous political, social, economic and \nenvironmental challenges facing the world (see \nA/65/PV.103).  \n I could not agree with him more. Pandemics such \nas AIDS, malaria and non-communicable diseases; \nthreats related to terrorism, weapons of mass \ndestruction, human trafficking, the illicit trade in and \nuse of small arms and light weapons and the illicit drug \ntrade; and the risks posed by climate change and the \ncontinuing vulnerability of our women and youth all \ncall upon us to deepen our cooperation and strengthen \nour international institutions. \n Although some citizens in developing countries \nenjoy good living standards, the realization of \nsustainable development in many of those countries \n  \n \n11-50871 20 \n \nremains unattainable. Achieving social justice for all \nrepresents the most basic humanitarian challenge of \nour times. In order to move the world further along the \npath of compassion, solidarity and shared \nresponsibility, that goal deserves our highest attention. \n As the world becomes more intertwined, the \nimpact of climate change in one country or region is \naffecting the prosperity and security of others as well. \nAs responsible citizens of this precious planet, we must \nstand united behind the collective goal to preserve our \nworld for current and future generations. Our \nunderstanding of climate change suggests that our \nplanet will undergo considerable changes over the next \n50 years, impacting all areas of society. \n For Suriname, with its low-lying coastline, that \nmeans a vulnerable exposure to a rising sea level, \nrisking inundation of our fertile soil and freshwater \nreservoirs. With 80 per cent of Suriname\u2019s population \nliving in the coastal area, our ability to produce food \nand guarantee food security will be in serious jeopardy. \nFor countries such as ours, it is therefore of paramount \nimportance that the international community honour its \ncommitments, realize the speedy implementation of the \nCanc\u00fan Agreements and honour its pledges to the \nSpecial Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation \nFund. \n We cannot afford for the upcoming United \nNations Climate Change Conference in Durban to fail \nto produce concrete agreements and targets on reducing \nemissions, which would lead to a halt or drastically \nreduce the rising temperature on the planet. We owe \nthat to our present and we owe that to our future \ngenerations. We call upon all parties concerned to \nreach an agreement. \n Suriname now stands at a crossroads in its efforts \nto attain sustainable development. We resolve to \npromote an investment-friendly environment, with \nprudent fiscal and monetary policies that are aimed at \nsecuring macroeconomic stability in the medium and \nlong terms. Allow me to outline the main objectives of \nour development strategy. We intend to maintain real \neconomic growth and raise per capita income, while \nsimultaneously promoting a more equitable income \ndistribution. We will further develop the mining sector \nas the engine of economic growth in the short and \nmedium terms. We plan to move away from a \ncommodity-based economy and focus on the \ndiversification of our economy and increased \ninvestment in other sectors, such as the agro-industry, \ntourism, services, transport, infrastructure and housing. \nWe will invest in our human capital, which is our most \nimportant resource. In that context, Suriname will \nstrengthen its national capacities to enhance our the \nutilization of our abundant natural resources for the \nbenefit of its people. \n We are well aware that we cannot move forward \nin isolation. We recognize the strategic interest of \ninternational cooperation to complement national \ndevelopment policies. In that process, we are strongly \ncommitted to the objectives of such regional \norganizations as the Caribbean Community and the \nUnion of South American Nations (UNASUR). \n Despite the current international financial \ncrisis \u2014 which is not of our making \u2014 Suriname\u2019s \npresent economic outlook remains favourable. \nImproper management of the world crisis, however, \nwill have negative consequences on our economy. We \nare pleased with the UNASUR proposal for a complete \nrestructuring of the international financial system, with \nthe participation of all nations in the decision-making \nprocess. The time has come to bring an end to the \npractice of decision-making by only a few, which has \nhad disastrous consequences for the majority of the \npeoples of the world. For countries such as Suriname, \nwith small, open economies, it remains of vital \nimportance to continue on the path of prudent \nmacroeconomic policies and economic diversification. \n Since it is understood that sustainable \ndevelopment can be attained only in a safe \nenvironment, it is crucial to preserve international \npeace and security. Armed conflicts, interference in the \ndomestic affairs of States, terrorism and transnational \ncrime \u2014 including drug-related crime and the illegal \ntraffic in and use of small arms and light weapons \u2014 \nonly derail our efforts to address the challenges that we \nare faced with today. \n At the sixty-sixth session of the General \nAssembly, we are once again called on to reflect on the \nspirit of our Charter as it relates to the assurance of \ninternational peace, security and development. The \ntheme for this session, \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means\u201d, is most \nfitting, since mediation can and should become one of \nthe most effective instruments in international conflict \nresolution. The failure to recognize and apply the \nprinciples of equity and justice in international \n \n \n21 11-50871 \n \nrelations has resulted in unacceptable situations. Those \nhave brought about extreme poverty, further \nmarginalization, increasingly brutal forms of \ncriminality and destruction of the environment. \n At the same time, we increasingly witness acts of \nwar and intervention in many parts of the world. Such \narmed conflicts are sometimes preceded by a mandate \nof our very own Security Council, with disregard for \nthe consequences of destruction, loss of life and human \nsuffering. Suriname wishes to draw urgent attention to \nthe stipulations of Article 33 in Chapter VI of the \nUnited Nations Charter, which in our opinion have not \nbeen consistently applied. That failure has resulted in \nan unnecessary continuation of violence on the African \ncontinent. \n I also express concern regarding the situation in \nSomalia, where severe famine has taken the lives of \ntens of thousands and continues to be a threat to \nthousands more. We must ask ourselves if the \narchitects of the acts of war on that same continent \u2014 \nunder the pretext of the protection of human rights \u2014 \ncould not better have used those precious resources in \nthe fight against famine. Furthermore, the Security \nCouncil should be a forum for dialogue and action, \nfully responsive to current and future global \nchallenges, and should not be permitted to bypass the \nefforts of regional institutions that aim to promote the \npeaceful settlement of disputes. In particular, when \noutbursts of violence occur, peaceful efforts should \nnever be hindered or neglected. \n On a special note, it is of great concern that \napproximately 18 months after the disastrous \nearthquake in Haiti, the recovery efforts on that island \nnation are stagnating. We therefore call upon the \ninternational community to honour its pledges and \ncontinue to support the efforts of the Haitian people to \nreconstruct their homeland. \n Suriname reaffirms the right of the Palestinian \npeople to self-determination, including the right to an \nindependent State of Palestine, as endorsed by the \nGeneral Assembly in December 2010 (see resolution \n65/202). Suriname has responded to the plight of the \nPalestinian people and has taken the decision to \nrecognize Palestine as a sovereign State, worthy of \nbecoming a full-fledged Member of this world \nOrganization. \n We also reiterate our concern about the \npersistence of the imposition of the economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. Those \nmeasures continue to cause hardship for the Cuban \npeople and to have adverse effects on the just \ndevelopment of that country. How many more \nresolutions need to be adopted before justice can be \ndone for the people of Cuba? Suriname once more calls \non the States Members of the United Nations to \nvehemently reject the unilaterally imposed embargo on \nthis nation. \n In closing, the provisions and the spirit enshrined \nin the Charter of the United Nations remain valid as an \ninstrument for promoting international peace, security \nand development. \n As Members, we have the moral obligation to \ncontinue to live up to the provisions of our Charter, \ntaking into consideration the demands of changing \ntimes in a changing world. \n We must, however, ensure that unity and justice \nreign among all nations.

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to address the \ninternational community, first of all, to express the \npleasure of the Government of the Republic of Panama \nat the election of His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. \n The delegation of Panama is gratified by the \nholding of the general debate in the presence of the \nSecretary-General and representatives of the different \nMember States, Observers and organizations. We \nwould like to congratulate the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session for his excellent \nwork. \n President Al-Nasser has invited us to focus this \ndebate on strengthening the role of mediation in the \npeaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \nresolution. The importance of this theme invites us to \ndeeply reflect on its multiple dimensions, given that \nmediation is an essential instrument in the preservation \nof international peace and security. \n Panama is a multi-ethnic country where people of \ndifferent races, cultures, creeds and languages coexist \nin harmony and freedom, and where love of \nrepresentative democracy, independence and respect \nfor the sovereignty, ideology and territorial integrity of \nall countries are inalienable specific qualities that \ndefine us as a nation. \n In our view, and as a founding member of the \nUnited Nations, Panama will always advocate for \ninternational peace and security, the promotion of \ndialogue among Member States, the strengthening of \nmultilateral dynamics and facilitating the mission of \nthe United Nations. That is largely due to experiences \naccumulated during the course of the diplomatic \nhistory of our country. More than three decades ago, \nfor a second and last time, the Security Council held an \nextraordinary session away from Headquarters, with \nthe purpose of politically mediating the dispute over \nthe sovereignty of Panama over its Canal and the \nterritories adjacent to the Canal Zone, controlled at that \ntime by the United States of America, which was the \nplatform that launched the Panamanian cause onto the \ninternational stage. \n It was the joint will and intervention of the \nmembers of this illustrious General Assembly, \ndemonstrated in its historic resolution 31/143, of 1976, \nwhich to a great extent inspired the signing of the \nTreaties between Panama and the United States in \n1977. Nowadays, the Panama Canal, fully under our \nsovereign authority, is one of the most important axes \nof our economic development, supervised by a \nPanamanian administration, for the benefit of all \nnations. Panamanians will always be grateful to the \nUnited Nations for this noble success of \nmultilateralism. \n In the 1980s, the Contadora Group was \nestablished in Panama as a mechanism for multilateral \nmediation. It forged a Latin American alliance \ncommitted to democracy, economic cooperation and \nregional security and led to the Esquipulas peace \nagreement \u2014 an overarching advance in the \nconsolidation of peace in Central America. The \nContadora Group was the predecessor of the Rio \nGroup, which is today an important mechanism for \nconsultation and coordination in Latin America. \n When our democracy was restored in the early \n1990s, with the support of the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, we as a nation initiated \nsustained consultations among the principal actors of \nGovernment and civil society in order to strengthen our \nadministrative institutions, secure the return of the \nPanama Canal to Panama, overcome asymmetries in \nour country, and identify strategies to accomplish our \ndevelopment priorities. \n During the past two decades, our culture of \ndialogue has given us the skills necessary to transform \nour country into a democratic and dynamic society that \nis progressing at a steady pace under the current \nAdministration of the President of the Republic, \nRicardo Martinelli Berrocal. \n As a result, Panama is now considered the second \nmost competitive economy in Latin America, according \nto the World Economic Forum classification system, in \n \n \n17 11-51681 \n \nview of our first-class financial system, our ports, our \nhigh-quality multimodal logistics infrastructure and our \nefficient technology \u2014 all of this in an environment \nthat is open to business and generates global interest in \nforeign direct investment. \n Our robust prospects for economic growth and \nour effective management of public debt, in \ncombination with continuous, adequate and careful \nfinancial discipline, have been the determining factors \nin our recently achieved investment grade with a stable \noutlook, according to the major rating agencies. \nLikewise, we have begun to implement an active \ncooperation agenda in the area of information \nexchange and fiscal transparency. We have adopted all \nof the measures suggested, which have enabled us to \ncomply with the recommendations of the Organization \nfor Economic Cooperation and Development in this \nrespect. However, this journey to success has not been \neasy, and many future challenges remain. \n I believe that all of those here today will take on \nthe main challenges faced by the international \ncommunity in the process of achieving a coherent \nrestructuring of the world economy and the reform of \nits institutions and oversight mechanisms. Panama is \nfully aware of this need, and our international agenda \nrequires us to participate actively in the major \nmultilateral mechanisms and economic and commercial \nintegration forums in the areas of investment, tourism \nand technology, for the benefit of our citizens. Panama \nbelieves that such efforts must be promoted without \ndelay by the major economies if we truly wish to \novercome the turbulence in international markets. \n Our country also believes that to ensure a \nfavourable economic climate, domestic conflicts must \nbe prevented. This depends on, inter alia, the \neffectiveness of the democratic regime, public security, \nrespect for human rights, the responsible management \nof natural resources, tolerance, access to health-care \nand sanitation services, the affordability of basic \ngoods, good governance, and inclusive and balanced \ndevelopment. \n We in Panama, after living for 21 years under a \nmilitary dictatorship \u2014 until 1989 \u2014 have made a \nstrong commitment to democracy as a means of \npeacefully resolving the disputes that arise in our \nsociety. The experiences suffered under that \ndictatorship have led us to speak out unequivocally, in \nbilateral and multilateral forums, in favour of the \nstrengthening or re-establishment of the effectiveness \nof democratic institutions wherever necessary. This has \nled us to clearly express our position in defence of \ndemocracy in cases such as those involving Honduras, \nthe failed coup attempt in Ecuador, and the Arab \nSpring, which brought the winds of freedom to that \nregion of the world. \n The duty to resolve disputes that give rise to \ninternational conflicts lies primarily with those States \nwhose disagreements have generated the conflicts in \nquestion. Nevertheless, the United Nations, as the \nepicentre of global diplomacy, must increasingly \nperfect the art of mediation as a means of resolving \ninternational disputes. We can never forget that this is a \nfundamental principle of the Charter of the United \nNations, enshrined in its Article 33 \u2014 a mandate that \nhas resulted in many accomplishments around the \nworld, where wisdom, mutual understanding and \nagreement have prevailed over aggression, hate and \ndestruction. \n Mediation and dialogue have formed the basis of \nthe stand that Panama has taken in connection with \nconflicts that have a bearing on peace and international \npolitical stability. Allow me to point out in that respect \nthat the Government of the Republic of Panama \nbelieves that the Palestinian people have the right to be \nrecognized as a State, but that they must first resolve \ntheir differences with their neighbour Israel, which also \nhas the right to peaceful and harmonious coexistence \nwith Palestine and the other States of the region. There \ncould be no better solution than one that emerges from \ndirect negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian \nNational Authority. \n We also trust in the outcome of dialogue between \nthe parties in the case of China. Panama, with full \nrespect for the existing diplomatic truce, calls for \ngreater participation by Taiwan in international forums \nand initiatives, in recognition of the fact that its people \nwish to contribute to the pursuit of global peace and \nwell-being. \n For that reason, and given the relevance of this \nimportant provision of international law, we invite the \nSecretary-General and the President of the General \nAssembly to continue to promote and enhance the role \nof mediation as a viable strategy for the peaceful \nresolution of disputes. \n However, for the United Nations system to \ncontinue its effective peace mediation activities, each \n  \n \n11-51681 18 \n \nMember State must honour the commitments \nundertaken, so that the Organization can count on \nsufficient resources. This call for international \ncooperation is particularly relevant in these times of \nbudgetary constraints in many countries, and given that \naggressive competition for scarce resources is one of \nthe primary causes of armed conflicts. \n Panama is a country with a lengthy and notable \nhistory of peace and conciliation. In our opinion, the \nbest option when faced with the threat of armed \nconflict is comprehensive, transparent and \nunconditional diplomatic dialogue between the parties. \n We welcome the fact that in July 2011 the \ninternational community marked an important \nmilestone along the path to a collective security \narchitecture through the unanimous adoption of a \nresolution entitled \u201cStrengthening the role of mediation \nin the peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict \nprevention and resolution\u201d (resolution 65/283). That \nconsensus represents the victory of reason over the \nabsurd and harmful option of confrontation. The \ninternational community has seen clearly the major \nadvantages of investing in a concerted effort to \nconsolidate peace before it becomes necessary to \ncontain the human tragedies resulting from violent \nconflicts, as we have witnessed and are witnessing in \nSomalia, for instance, where hunger, disease and \ndestruction reign. \n Human history has taught us that hunger, poverty, \nignorance, injustice and social inequality give rise to \nthe greatest threats to peace and security. If we, the \nStates Members of the United Nations, remain \ndetermined to save succeeding generations from the \nscourge of war, we must opt for proactively ensuring a \npeace that is based not on action taken in reaction to \npolitical or military acts of aggression, but on faith in \nand guarantees of universal and equal human rights in \nall corners of the world. \n As we believe in the valuable role that the United \nNations should play, Panama is very proud to share \nwith this Assembly the fact that the Government of \nPresident Ricardo Martinelli proposed the creation of a \nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Latin America and \nthe Caribbean, with the aim of strengthening \ncoordination and dialogue among regional agencies, in \nparticular the 16 United Nations bodies already \nestablished in Panama. The national Government will \nfinance the project, which will be a unique model of \nbest practices in implementing sustainable \ndevelopment in Latin America and the world. \n In the past decade, our country\u2019s privileged \ngeographic position and the logistical infrastructure \nthat Panama City offers has attracted various \nhumanitarian aid organizations. That has also \nencouraged Panama to promote the construction of a \nregional humanitarian assistance logistics centre for the \nAmericas. The regional centre will have the necessary \nagreements to expedite the entry and exit of \nhumanitarian aid in order to help in the event of natural \nor other disasters, such as occurred last year in Haiti, \nwhere the international humanitarian agenda is still \nvery necessary.  \n With such projects, we reiterate our commitment \nto the multilateral system and to the United Nations \nOrganization, and show that, as small lower-middle \nincome developing countries, we also provide \ninternational cooperation, even in such times of \neconomic difficulty for the large economies. \n Nor does Panama wish to miss the opportunity \nbefore the Assembly to call for reflection on the \nenvironmental, political and social challenges that all \nour societies face and that we must overcome, once \nagain, through dialogue and cooperation among States \nin an effort to address those global challenges.  \n Without a doubt, one of those great challenges is \nthat posed by climate change and its effects. Climate \nchange is a priority of my country\u2019s foreign policy at \nthe environmental level. We are committed to all \nefforts aimed at strengthening international \nenvironmental organizations and to the struggle to find \njoint solutions to the causes and effects of that \nphenomenon. \n As part of our support to the Organization\u2019s own \ninitiatives and for the benefit of the international \ncommunity, we will host the meeting of the ad hoc \nworking groups of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, soon to take place in \nDurban, South Africa. Those working groups will meet \nin Panama from 1 to 7 October in order to advance the \nmodalities for a second commitment period of carbon \nemission reductions by developed countries and for \nstabilization of the global temperature so as to make \nprogress in fully implementing the Framework \nConvention through long-term cooperation \nmechanisms. \n \n \n19 11-51681 \n \n Panama hopes that the meeting will serve as a \nbridge between the results obtained in the Mexico \nmeeting and those that may emerge in the one that will \ntake place in South Africa, since it is necessary to set \nclear, transparent and ambitious goals. Also, the \npolitical will of developed countries in the matter must \nbe reaffirmed, as they have the primary responsibility \nunder the Convention. \n In conclusion, as the Secretary-General rightly \nstated in his opening address to the general debate:  \n \u201cSaving our planet, lifting people out of poverty \nand advancing economic growth \u2014 those are one \nand the same fight.\u201d (, p. 1) \n That is why Panama, once again and before the \nGeneral Assembly, renews its commitment to the \ncommunity of nations to work for a world where war, \nsectarian hate, discrimination, intolerance and \ndestruction waged under different flags and creeds that, \nwithout any justification, generate only poverty and \nmisery, may finally be replaced by the dialogue, \nnegotiation, cooperation and friendship stemming from \ndifferences that, on the contrary, have always been a \nsource of wealth and well-being for the peoples of the \nworld.

        "file_text": "I come \nto speak before the Assembly representing a country \nthat is celebrating the two-hundredth anniversary of the \nendeavour that led to its birth as an independent and \nsovereign State, and that has preserved its aspiration to \ncontinue offering the international community its long-\nstanding tradition of respect for the principles of \ninternational law and its ongoing commitment to the \ncause of peace and peaceful coexistence among \nnations. \n Uruguay takes pride in its calling to serve the \ninternational community in promoting dialogue, \nunderstanding and the tireless search for consensus as \nthe most appropriate ways for interaction among its \nmembers. It was through the application of those \nprinciples that we recognized and welcomed this year \nthe 193rd Member of this Organization, the Republic \nof South Sudan.  \n Likewise, in March we recognized the State of \nPalestine. We believe that all of the necessary \nconditions have been met for this recognition to \nbecome universal and for the realization of a two-State \nsolution, which Uruguay has supported since 1947, as \nwell as for a path that reaffirms the right of Israel and \nPalestine to coexist in peace, within secure and \nrecognized borders, in a environment of renewed \ncooperation and free from any threats or actions that \ncould jeopardize peace. \n The Palestinian people have a legitimate and full \nright to statehood. But the Jewish people also have the \nundeniable right to live in peace in a safe country, free \nof terrorist attacks \u2014 attacks that Uruguay has always \nrejected and condemned. \n Uruguay is proud to have made a decisive \ncontribution to the creation of the State of Israel, \nwhose hard-working people have lived up to the \nhistoric vision of the men and women who made its \ncreation possible. We are convinced also that the time \nhas come for the Palestinian people to show the world \ntheir decisive contribution to peace, development and \ninternational cooperation. \n Once again, in keeping with our adherence to \ninternational law, we cannot but express our utmost \nrejection of coercive measures that violate the \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, such as \nthe economic, trade and financial blockade imposed by \nthe United States against Cuba \u2014 a unilateral measure \nthat contravenes not only the Charter but also \ninternational law as well as one of the most important \nprinciples of my country\u2019s foreign policy, namely, the \npeaceful settlement of disputes. \n We reject all manner of violence and all threat or \nuse of illegal force, including terrorism \u2014 an unjust \nand unjustified crime, a cruel scourge that 10 years ago \nmost painfully affected New York City. We express our \ncondolences and solidarity to the victims\u2019 families and \nthe American people, as well as our desire and \ncommitment to ensure that these kinds of acts never \nhappen again, here or anywhere else.  \n While we are guided by the principles of \ninternational law, the promotion and protection of \nhuman rights and international humanitarian law also \nfigure among the priorities of Uruguayan foreign \npolicy. This a reflection of the country\u2019s political and \ninstitutional heritage, that of deep-seated democracy \nand the solid rule of law. \n Allow me to express in that respect my gratitude \nin connection with the honour conferred on us when \nUruguay was elected to chair the Human Rights \nCouncil. We will strive to honour this vote of \nconfidence by working every day to strengthen the \nmultilateral system for the protection and promotion of \nhuman rights. \n Uruguay has an outstanding record in this area, \nnot only because it is one of the countries that has \nsigned the widest array of conventions, but also \nbecause it has made specific contributions in diverse \nfields, including the defence of the rights of the child; \nthe mainstreaming of a gender perspective into all \nUnited Nations system policies and programmes, as \nreflected in the establishment and implementation of \nthe United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women; and the promotion of \nfundamental freedoms, including, inter alia, freedom of \nexpression. \n \n \n11 11-51384 \n \n During the course of its mandate, our country \nintends to promote a new culture of dialogue on human \nrights \u2014 a culture that favours the cooperation of \ncountries with the system, but also of the system with \nthose countries that need assistance to improve their \ninternal human rights situation. We would also like to \nenhance the Council\u2019s working methods and promote \nthe implementation of its instruments in a non-selective \nmanner, avoiding double standards. We would also like \nto strengthen the role of the Office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as a \nkey element of promotion and protection mechanisms, \nby providing the resources necessary so that it can \neffectively discharge the mandates that Member States \nare increasingly assigning to it. \n Uruguay is not indifferent to situations of armed \nconflict. That is why we have made tremendous efforts \nin that respect and will continue to do so in order to \nmaintain and strengthen the applicable norms of \ninternational humanitarian law. \n In keeping with this, we believe that we cannot \nignore mass atrocities such as genocide, war crimes, \ncrimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Bearing \nin mind at all times the principle of non-intervention in \nthe internal affairs of other States \u2014 a principle that \nour country and region holds dear \u2014 we recognize the \nState\u2019s primary responsibility to protect its population, \nas well as the importance of fostering cooperation with \nStates that might require international assistance to \nfulfil that obligation. The aim is not to weaken their \nsovereignty but, rather, to strengthen it. \n A few months ago, we welcomed the Secretary-\nGeneral to our country, and we congratulated him once \nagain on his re-election, which Uruguay \nenthusiastically supported from the outset. Mr. Ban \nKi-moon expressed the recognition of the international \ncommunity of one of the most relevant aspects of our \nforeign policy over the past several decades: our \nunwavering and committed participation in United \nNations peacekeeping operations. With approximately \n30 per cent of its operational defence forces devoted to \nthese operations, Uruguay is the main troop contributor \nas a proportion of its population and ranks 10th in \nabsolute terms. Uruguay thus places at the disposal of \nthe United Nations valuable human and material \nresources in the context of work that is the flagship of \nthis Organization, deploying in situations and \ndischarging mandates of increasingly complexity. \n Given the complexity of current international \naffairs, together we have begun an in-depth discussion \nof the United Nations peacekeeping system. We are \nconvinced that these missions will be sustainable only \nif we seriously reconsider the resources needed for \ntheir proper functioning and update the conditions \noffered by the system so as to ensure that the United \nNations is supplied with both equipment and human \nresources. \n Today peacekeeping operations are the most \nimportant and visible aspect of United Nations \nmissions and the one that most exposes the United \nNations to international scrutiny, often positive but \nsometimes negative. \n Uruguay reaffirms its commitment to \npeacekeeping operations and to the strictest \nenforcement of the mandates and standards regulating \nthe conduct of field personnel. That is why, in cases of \nshameful and unacceptable misconduct \u2014 such as that \nperpetrated by five members of our military deployed \nin Haiti, where since the beginning of the United \nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti we have \ncontributed tens of thousands of men and women, some \nof whom have offered their lives to help that brother \ncountry consolidate peace and stability \u2014 we have not \nhesitated to act with the utmost severity and rigor as \nthe circumstances demanded. Under my country\u2019s \nmilitary justice, those five individuals accused of \nmilitary crimes have now been sentenced to prison and \nthe case has been referred to the civil justice system to \ninitiate the corresponding criminal case. Thus, within \nthe framework of respect for due process and in the \nutmost transparency and cooperation with the relevant \nUnited Nations entities, we will stop at nothing to \nuncover the truth and punish those responsible. \n Our commitment to international peace and \nsecurity has also driven our country to play an active \nrole in the field of disarmament. Like many countries, \nUruguay has firmly promoted all initiatives aimed at \neliminating nuclear weapons and other weapons of \nmass destruction and at regulating the control and \nreduction of conventional weapons, which every year \ncause thousands of innocent civilian casualties. \n As a signatory of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, by \nvirtue of which Latin America and the Caribbean \nbecame the first nuclear-weapon-free zone, Uruguay \nhas decisively contributed to strengthening both the \nregional regime and the Treaty on the \n  \n \n11-51384 12 \n \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is \nconsidered the cornerstone of the disarmament and \nnon-proliferation regime. Uruguay has adhered fully to \nthe five points identified by the Secretary-General. We \nbelieve that the international community must make \nthe most of progress to date to advance firmly towards \na world free from nuclear weapons. \n The topic of this year\u2019s general debate is linked \nto the international peace and security agenda. We \ntherefore welcome the selection of a topic that \nunderlines the pressing need to strengthen the political \ncapacities of the United Nations. Professional and \naccurate prevention and mediation efforts could save \nthousands of human lives and billions of dollars of \nmaterial damage, thereby avoiding the loss of \ngenerations, growing resentment and despair, and a \nvicious cycle of violence can be broken only by \nreconciliation. \n That is why we welcome efforts to strengthen the \nrole of mediation and preventive diplomacy as \nmechanisms for dispute settlement. Such efforts can be \ncarried out at several levels. There can be no doubt that \nthe United Nations is the natural forum for such \nefforts, given its intrinsic legitimacy and impartiality. \nHowever, it cannot be denied that in practice such \nefforts must be complemented by the actions of \nregional entities and even individual countries, which \ncan be very effective, as has been shown in several \ninstances. In addition to the strengthening of the \naforementioned capacities, confronting global issues \nrequires the development of community spirit that \nrequires more than combined political will. A systemic \napproach is fundamental.  \n Climate change is probably the most obvious \nexample of an urgent global challenge. It is essential to \nimmediately start enforcing adaptation and mitigation \nmeasures against its adverse effects, since a \ncompromised environment will limit any development \neffort. We are aware that necessary measures require \nchanges in modes of production to avoid seriously \ncompromising resource distribution within our \ncountries. \n The Uruguayan Government strongly supports \nnegotiations on climate change under the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(UNFCCC). We take this opportunity to call for \naccelerated efforts to ensure a second stage of \ncommitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in \nthe outcome of the next Conference of Parties to the \nUNFCCC. Furthermore, it is essential that progress be \nmade in the negotiations on chemicals, especially in \nthe context of the current exercise on mercury. The \nsensitivity and importance of this matter, which has \ngreatly potential to harm the environment, requires the \ncommitment of all countries in order to successfully \nconclude the current negotiations. \n Another priority of our country is the particular \nsituation of agriculture as it relates to the climate \nchange phenomenon. A huge number of developing \ncountries, including my own, depend on that sector, \nwhich is especially vulnerable to its negative \nconsequences. That is why agriculture requires a \nspecial chapter in the framework of the UNFCC \nnegotiations.  \n A new balance among many centres of power, the \nemergence of new States and intra-State conflicts have \ncalled for a reformulation of peace missions. Global \nthreats include climate change and terrorism, and an \ninternational criminal justice entity has been \nestablished. Profound political changes have taken \nplace in many countries. We now live in a different \nworld. But the changes do not affect only political and \nsecurity matters. Enormous transformations are taking \nplace in the global economy and development issues. \nDeveloped countries are facing serious difficulties in \ntheir efforts to recover from a deep economic crisis. \nNew, so-called emerging economies are playing a \ngrowing role in setting the direction of the world \neconomy. In recent years, the need to establish new \nregulations and global agreements has become ever \nmore apparent. We are entering a new era in \ninternational economic relations. \n In that context, we must remember that peace and \nstability will not be achieved without sustainable \ndevelopment. This year, the United Nations has taken \nvery significant steps in recognizing the link between \nsecurity and development, which is born not from \npolitical declarations, but from empirical evidence, and \nis a sine qua non of capacity-building at the national \nlevel.  \n The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20) will provide us with a unique \nopportunity to renew the will to achieve the goals and \ncommitments contained in Agenda 21 and the \nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation. The quest for \nlong-term development must be based on a \n \n \n13 11-51384 \n \ncomprehensive development concept that takes \neconomic, social and environmental dimensions into \naccount. We believe it essential that Rio+20 achieve \ntangible results that benefit our citizens. For that to \nhappen, issues related to technology transfer, technical \ntraining and financing for developing countries must be \ntaken into account.  \n Food security is a fundamental component of \nUruguay\u2019s development agenda, as well as one of its \nnational priorities. We remain convinced that the \ncurrent critical situation is caused by structural causes \nthat must be resolved collectively and urgently. We are \nparticularly concerned by the paralysis in the \nnegotiations of the Doha Round of the World Trade \nOrganization. That ambitious exercise, one of whose \nobjectives is the reduction or elimination of trade \ndistortions, could, by strengthening trade, promote the \ndevelopment of the most disadvantaged countries of \nthe world. \n It is essential to eliminate agricultural subsidies. \nCountries that until a few decades ago were self-\nsufficient for their food needs now need to import a \nlarge part of what they consume, and they do so from \ncountries that subsidize their agricultural production. \nThe artificially low prices of agriculture exports, \nsustained for decades by some countries through \nsubsidies and other trade-distorting measures and \nlimitations on market access, are mainly responsible of \nthe food security problems.  \n Stimulating investment to increase production \nand improve productivity, a successful conclusion of \nthe Doha Round, as well as the transfer of adequate \ntechnology to developing countries, capable of \nachieving efficient agricultural economies, are \nfundamental to obtaining food security. \n As a middle-income country, Uruguay still faces \nserious development challenges, particularly in \neradicating poverty, diversifying production, \nintroducing technological innovation and promoting \nrenewable energy, to name but a few. The progress \nachieved must be consolidated, and to that end it is \nvital for us to be able to count on the support of the \ninternational community, and of the United Nations \nsystem in particular. I must reiterate the urgent need to \nconsider in depth a new cooperation modality or \nscheme that takes into account the specific \ndevelopment needs of middle-income countries like \nUruguay. \n Uruguay is committed to the reform process of \nthe Organization. Through the Global Governance \nGroup, we have maintained a proactive attitude in \norder to promote a strong bond between the United \nNations and informal discussion forums outside the \nsystem. However, it is critical to lead by example. For \nthat reason, we believe that improving global \ngovernance is first an internal task of the United \nNations system. In this regard, my country is very \nsatisfied with the results obtained in the pilot \nprogramme of Delivering as One, whose next \nintergovernmental conference will be held in \nNovember in Montevideo. \n For all these reason, but above all because of its \nfirm commitment to the cause of peace and \nmultilateralism, Uruguay is seeking a seat as a \nnon-permanent member of the Security Council in \n2016-2017. That would be our country\u2019s second time in \nthe past 66 years, after having served in 1965-1966. \n In conclusion, consolidating multilateralism is \none of the most challenging international tasks. \nMultiple ongoing crises demand immediate response \nand action. The rise of new informal forums with a \nlimited number of members but a growing influence in \ninternational governance requires an additional \ncollective effort to strengthen the role of the United \nNations as a forum for political discussion in which all \nStates are able to participate in decision-making.  \n A permanent effort is required to combine \neffectiveness with legitimacy \u2014 a challenge that has \nbecome increasingly more significant as globalization \ndeepens. We need a new United Nations for the twenty-\nfirst century. The first decade of the century has \nalready run its course. History is harsh with those who \ncannot adapt to its challenges, and its consequences are \nbitter. At the United Nations, we are responsible for \nputting forward appropriate answers to the \ninternational community. There is still time."

        "file_text": "I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his \nelection as President of the sixty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is confident that \nunder his able leadership the General Assembly will \nsuccessfully address the pressing issues on the agenda \nof the current session. I also wish to pay tribute to his \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for having successfully \nsteered the proceedings of this House during the sixty-\nfifth session. \n I wish also to congratulate the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, on his reappointment for a second \nterm. We remain hopeful that the Secretary-General \nwill strive to shepherd the United Nations with an \nopen, transparent and inclusive multilateral approach. \nSuch an approach, I believe, would renew and revive \nthe hopes and expectations of developing countries in \nthe efficacy of this world body. Zimbabwe places its \nhopes in a United Nations that recognizes the equality \nof sovereign States as enshrined in the founding \nCharter. \n I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to \nthe Republic of South Sudan on its attainment of \nindependence and its subsequent admission as the \n193rd Member of the United Nations family. As we all \ncongratulate this new nation, Zimbabwe calls upon the \ninternational community to render all the necessary \nsupport to its Government and its people in tackling the \nnumerous development challenges that lie ahead of \nthem. Zimbabwe stands ready to make its modest \ncontribution to that end. \n The theme \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means\u201d is most apt. \nBut how do we, the United Nations Members, measure \nup in relation to it in our activities here at the United \nNations and out there, in the real world? It is my \nprincipled view that we must be duty-and honour-\nbound to operationalize the principles upon which the \nCharter of the United Nations is based. We must not be \nguilty of manipulating the Charter to serve our \nparticular or sectional designs and ambitions. The \nCharter is our set of commandments that must be \nstrictly obeyed by each and every Member if \ninternational and regional peace is to be maintained.  \n We cannot honestly say today that this is the \nposition with regard to NATO States versus Libya. \nWhatever political disturbances might have first \noccurred in Benghazi, the process of mediation and \npeaceful negotiations was never given full play. It was \ndeliberately and blatantly excluded from positively \ninfluencing developments. There was quick resort to \ninvoking Chapter VII of the Charter, with a gross, \ndeliberate misinterpretation of the scope of the \nmandate originally given NATO to oversee and protect \ncivilians. \n Bilateral hatreds and quarrels or ulterior motives \nmust not be allowed to creep into the consideration of \nmatters pertaining to threats to international peace and \nsecurity, or even to the principle of the responsibility to \nprotect. \n We have yet to be convinced that the involvement \nof the mighty Powers in Libya\u2019s affairs has not \nhindered the advent of the process of peace, democracy \nand prosperity in that sister African country. Our \nAfrican Union would never have presumed to impose a \n  \n \n11-50871 18 \n \nleadership on the fraternal people of Libya, as NATO \ncountries have illegally sought to do, and, in fact, have \ndone. At the very least, the African Union would have \nwished to join those principled members of this body \nwho preferred an immediate ceasefire and peaceful \ndialogue in Libya. The African Union was and remains \nfully seized of this crisis and will spare no effort in \nworking to fully complement the United Nations so \nthat peace may return to Libya and its tormented \npeople. We wish that process Godspeed. \n The newly minted principle of the responsibility \nto protect should not be twisted to provide cover for its \npremeditated abuse in violating the sacred international \nprinciple enshrined in the Charter of non-interference \nin the domestic affairs of States, because to do so \namounts to an act of aggression and causes the \ndestabilization of a sovereign State. Moreover, to \nselectively and arbitrarily apply that principle serves \nmerely to undermine its general acceptability. Indeed, \nmore than other States, all five permanent members of \nthe Security Council bear a huge responsibility in this \nregard for ensuring that their historical privilege is \nused more to protect the United Nations Charter than to \nbreach it, as is happening currently in Libya through \nthe blatantly illegal, brutal, callous and murderous \nNATO bombings. There we see NATO bombing places, \nseeking out, hunting and hounding the children of \nAl-Qadhafi. Have the alleged sins of the father now \nbeen visited on the sons? Have the children lost their \nright to life? They are no longer human beings; they \nare being hunted every day. Or is it because each of \nthem is no longer worth the price of a barrel of oil? \n After more than 20,000 NATO bombing sorties \nthat targeted Libyan towns, including Tripoli, there is \nnow an unbelievable and most disgraceful scramble by \nsome NATO countries for Libyan oil, indicating \nthereby that the real motive for their aggression against \nLibya was to control and own its abundant fuel \nresources. What a shame.  \n Yesterday, it was Iraq, and Bush and Blair were \nthe liars and aggressors as they made unfounded \nallegations of possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction. This time, it is the NATO countries that are \nthe liars and aggressors, as they make similarly \nunfounded allegations of destruction of civilian lives \nby Al-Qadhafi. \n When we in Zimbabwe sought to redress the ills \nof colonialism and racism by fully acquiring our \nnatural resources, mainly our land and minerals, we \nwere and still are subjected to unparalleled vilification \nand pernicious economic sanctions, the reasons \u2014 lies \nagain \u2014 alleged to be violations of the rule of law, \nhuman rights and democracy, which never, never \noccurred. My people have condemned these illegal \nsanctions, and recently more than two million \nprotesters\u2019 signatures have demonstrated their \nantipathy for them. We thank the Southern Africa \nDevelopment Community (SADC) and the African \nUnion for supporting us and demanding the immediate \nremoval of the illegal sanctions. \n We in Africa are also duly concerned about the \nactivities of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \nwhich seems to exist only for alleged offenders from \nthe developing world, the majority of them Africans. A \nblind eye is routinely turned to leaders of the powerful \nWestern States guilty of international crimes, such as \nBush and Blair. Such selective justice has eroded the \ncredibility of the ICC on the African continent. \n My country continues to work with others for a \nrevitalized General Assembly. However, our ambitions \nextend to the need to reform the Security Council as \nwell. Africa\u2019s call for at least two permanent seats on \nthe Security Council for its members has been constant \nfor decades. Africa cannot remain the only region \nwithout permanent membership in the Security \nCouncil. \n The current global economic crisis and the \nattendant financial crisis compounds the plight of the \nmost vulnerable, that is, the developing countries. The \npresent international economic and financial \narchitecture has to be reformed and made to respond \ntimeously to the real needs of all our peoples. The \nsituation challenges the ability of our developing world \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \n As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the \nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action against \nracism, xenophobia and other related social ills, let us \nall recommit ourselves to fighting and defeating these \nevils. \n My country fully supports the right of the gallant \npeople of Palestine to statehood and membership in the \nOrganization. The United Nations must become \ncredible by welcoming into its bosom all those whose \nright to attain sovereign independence and freedom \nfrom occupation and colonialism is legitimate. Let us \nall accept Palestine as a legitimate State and a Member \n \n \n19 11-50871 \n \nof this body. Similarly, the tormented people of the \nSahrawi Arab Democratic Republic must not be \nforgotten. We call for immediate progress in the \nengagements for a solution to their long-running saga. \n The Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \nbe held later this year, is a pivotal occasion from which \nwe should emerge with agreed measures to address \nmatters of climate change and how to mitigate threats \nto the very existence of small island States in \nparticular, and to the coastal regions of many heavily \npopulated nations. Zimbabwe will be fully engaged in \nthose negotiations. \n Let me reiterate my country\u2019s full belief in the \naspirations enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations. We must all resist any abuse to which it may \nbe exposed through the unwelcome behaviour of a few. \nMy country celebrates the UN-Women entity, as it \naddresses the position of more than half of humankind \nin all our countries. \n The African Union must not be undermined; \nrather, it should be allowed to complement the efforts \nof the United Nations for peace and security on the \ncontinent. Zimbabwe is a peaceful member of the \nAfrican Union, SADC, the Common Market for \nEastern and Southern Africa, the Non-Aligned \nMovement and many other international economic and \ntrade organizations, and thus desires to continue to play \nits part in creating a peaceful environment in the world. \nThe United Nations can count on the unqualified \nsupport of Zimbabwe as required, even if only in our \nmodest way. \n I wish the sixty-sixth session of the General \nAssembly every success."

        "file_text": "I am pleased to add my voice to the \nunanimous acclaim of His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser as President of the General \nAssembly for this, our sixty-sixth session. A skilful and \nseasoned diplomat, he has played an integral role in \nestablishing the State of Qatar as a central and crucial \nactor in international diplomacy. I have no doubt that \nhe will approach his new responsibilities with similar \ndedication, even-handedness and compassion. \n In recent months the winds of change have \nencircled the globe, reaching and reshaping the \nunlikeliest corners of our planet, for good and for ill. \nThose winds have swept the nation of South Sudan into \nthese hallowed halls as a welcome and esteemed new \nmember of our global family. They are blowing away \nthe flimsy impediments to Palestinian statehood, and \nbreathing fresh air into stagnant negotiating processes. \nThe winds of change have howled across the sands of \nthe Middle East and North Africa, reshaping long-held \ngeopolitical assumptions. \n The grim economic storm clouds that formed \nominously on our global horizon three years ago have \nyet to dissipate, and, indeed, seem to be multiplying. \nNatural disasters, climate change, and the \naccompanying non-metaphorical winds of hurricanes \n \n \n17 11-51360 \n \nand tropical storms have buffeted my multi-island \nnation and my region yet again, upending our fragile \neconomies and causing painful developmental \nsetbacks. \n The United Nations finds itself in the eye of these \nincreasingly turbulent geopolitical and socio-economic \nstorms. The role that we collectively play in response \nto these howling gales will determine the contours of \nthe post-crisis world and the relevance of this \ninstitution in that world. Will the international \ncommunity shield the vulnerable from these winds? \nWill we harness their power for positive change? Or \nwill we become little more than unnecessary weather \nforecasters, watching and warning about which way the \nwinds blow, but never acting for the benefit of our \npeoples\u2019 humanization? \n The President has wisely selected \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes\u201d as the theme of \nthis general debate. That theme could not be more apt \nor timely. Too often, the difficult work of mediation, \nnegotiation and peaceful resolution of disputes is \nprematurely abandoned in the search for a quick fix of \nmilitarism, brinkmanship or ill-advised unilateral \naction. The very drafters of hard-fought Security \nCouncil resolutions often cast aside the letter and spirit \nof those documents before their ink has dried, and the \nfrenzied pursuit of a military solution to every dispute \nis sometimes sickeningly palpable. \n All too frequently, the loudest champions of \nexpensive and unnecessary military action are those \nleaders of military Powers who sometimes seek to \nshore up sagging local political fortunes with bullets, \nbombs and the bodies of faceless foreigners in faraway \nlands. History has never been kind to such nakedly \npolitical crusades, and those who have sown the wind \nhave invariably reaped the whirlwind of their bloody \ncampaigns, long after the triumphalist glow has faded. \nNeocolonialist and imperialist adventures, however \ndisguised, will never triumph before the bar of history \nover a people\u2019s right to self-determination and the \ninalienable embrace of sovereignty. \n The ongoing global economic and financial crisis \nis a devastating storm that has shown no signs of \nabating. Economies the world over remain in peril, and \nnone is immune from the widening and deepening \nfallout of this systemic crisis of ill-regulated financial \ninstitutions and the movement of capital. The effects of \nthe international global and financial meltdown are \nnow being felt well beyond the bottom lines of \nmultinational corporations. The macroeconomic and \ndevelopmental consequences of this economic tornado \nare now painfully apparent, as is the terrible impact on \nthe lives of individuals. \n The economic crisis has spurred rising global \nunemployment and poverty, and has engendered a \nfeeling of hopelessness, especially among young \npeople. The continuing fallout of the economic \nupheaval can be felt in streets and cities around the \nworld and is a major contributor to the global unrest \nthat has pitted disgruntled youths and others in violent \nopposition to Government forces, from Tottenham to \nTripoli. Social unrest elsewhere beckons, in dozens of \ncountries where neither the socio-economic conditions \nnor the political institutions can contain the enormous \npressures much longer. \n Well into our third year of the international \neconomic crisis, we can now declare that the tepid and \ntimid responses of wealthy developed nations have \nfailed to heal the global economy. The uncoordinated \nlurches from stimulus to austerity and back typify the \nconfusion of the self-appointed premier forums of our \ninternational economic cooperation. The recovery that \nthey prematurely declared was false and fleeting, and \ntheir counsel of patience and predictions of long-term \nrecovery are cold comfort to the suffering peoples of \ncountries that did not contribute to the crisis. \n In small, vulnerable and highly indebted middle-\nincome economies such as ours, the economic debacle \nthreatens to have debilitating and ongoing \nconsequences. We cannot afford to wait for the promise \nof incremental or cyclical up-ticks in the global \neconomy. Small States need the fiscal and policy space \nto creatively spur development in ways that comply not \nwith the checklists of discredited economic theorists, \nbut with real-world particularities and people-centred \npolicies. The international financial institutions have \nyet to sufficiently grasp this simple fact. \n The General Assembly must reassert its role in \nthe response to the international economic crisis. In the \nearly days of the global economic deterioration, Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines played a leading role in the \nUnited Nations Conference on the World Financial and \nEconomic Crisis and its Impact on Development. \nUnder the President\u2019s leadership, the Assembly must \nnow meaningfully follow up on the unfulfilled \nrecommendations and mechanisms spelled out at that \n  \n \n11-51360 18 \n \nConference. The Caribbean region has a vested interest \nin this most urgent of matters. \n This year, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was \nthe subject of a United Nations resolution (65/136) that \ncalled upon the international community to provide \nassistance in the wake of Hurricane Tomas, which \ncaused millions of dollars of damage in our region. \nWhile we are extremely grateful to the many countries \nthat contributed generously to the emergency response, \nour national and regional recovery is far from \ncomplete. In the light of the welcome call by the \nPresident of the General Assembly to focus on disaster \nprevention and response during the current session, I \nremind the international community of our continuing \nrecovery efforts and the ongoing vulnerability of small \nisland developing States during the still active 2011 \nAtlantic hurricane season. \n I remain baffled by the intransigence of major \nemitters and developed nations that refuse to shoulder \nthe burden for arresting the climate changes that are \nlinked to the excesses of their own wasteful policies. \nAs Hurricanes Irene and Katia crept northward to \ntypically untouched cities in the United States and the \nUnited Kingdom, we in the Caribbean felt saddened at \nthe extensive damage and tragic loss of life, which is \nan annual occurrence in our region. We can only hope \nthat our now-common experiences can engender a level \nof solidarity and constructive engagement that will lead \nto binding and meaningful emissions reduction targets \nand the fulfilment of commitments on adaptation \nfinancing for vulnerable small island developing \nStates. Time is running out on the very existence of \nmany countries in the face of rising oceans and \nincreasingly intense storms.  \n I am heartened that the President of the General \nAssembly has decided to place special emphasis on \nsustainable development and global prosperity during \nthe current session. But the citizens of the world, and \nindeed many of its Governments, have lost faith in \nendless self-important summits that produce little in \nthe way of tangible results. The archives of the United \nNations are filled with grandiloquent declarations and \noutcome documents from summits whose commitments \nwere forgotten even before representatives had boarded \ntheir planes to return home from their exotic venues. \n Next year, the issue of development returns to \nLatin America for the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development (Rio+20) in Brazil. Rio+20 \nwill take place one decade after Mexico\u2019s heralded \nMonterrey Consensus, in which developed countries \ncommitted themselves to the target of devoting 0.7 per \ncent of their gross national income to official \ndevelopment assistance to developing countries. Today, \neven accepting the liberal definitions and creative \naccounting used by some States to measure \ndevelopment assistance, developed countries are \ncontributing only 0.32 per cent of their gross national \nincome to official development assistance \u2014 less than \nhalf of the Monterrey target. We just have to make this \nbetter. We must do it right. It is just not good for us to \nbe taken for a ride all of these years with all of these \npromises. It must come to an end sometime, and the \nworld is changing. Let us get it right. It is our \nresponsibility. Please.  \n In that regard, our dreams remain constantly \nunfulfilled. I am reminded of the poetic inquiry of \nLangston Hughes, an authentic voice of America, who \nasked simply this: \n \u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred? \nDoes it dry up \nlike a raisin in the sun? \nOr fester like a sore \u2014 \nAnd then run? \nDoes it stink like rotten meat? \nOr crust and sugar over \u2014 \nlike a syrupy sweet? \nMaybe it just sags like a heavy load. \nOr does it explode?\u201d \nRecent events in the streets of major cities around the \nworld have probably answered Langston Hughes\u2019 \nqueries. Talk is cheap. We must get some action.  \n It should be a source of alarm and international \nembarrassment that the composition of the Security \nCouncil is an ossified relic of the Second World War, \nseemingly immune to the modern realities of new \ncountries and new global Powers. It is an outrageous \nact of international irresponsibility that such an \noutmoded and increasingly illegitimate body is allowed \nto decisively insert itself into local and regional \nconflicts. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is adamant \nthat the Security Council must be reformed, and that \nthe reform must be underpinned by the expansion of \nthe Council in the permanent and non-permanent \ncategories alike, with full regard for the legitimate \naspirations of Africa and the necessary \naccommodations for small island developing States, \n \n \n19 11-51360 \n \nwhich have valuable and creative perspectives on \npeacebuilding and conflict resolution. \n The International Year for People of African \nDescent, which was declared with much fanfare, is \nalmost at an end. I am grateful to the United Nations, \nwhich has hosted a number of events to raise \nawareness of the challenges facing people of African \ndescent and foster discussions on potential solutions to \ntackle those challenges. \n Racial discrimination was justified and itself \nbecame the justification for a brutal, exploitative and \ndehumanizing system. That system was perfected \nduring the transatlantic slave trade and ingrained over \nthe course of colonial domination. The structure of the \nmodern world is still firmly rooted in a past of slavers \nand colonialist exploitation. Today, every single \ncountry of the world with a population of majority \nAfrican descent is still trapped in the periphery of our \nglobal economic and developmental systems. The \npeoples of African descent remain disadvantaged, \nindividually and systemically, by the entrenched and \nunyielding cycle of discrimination. Indeed, many of the \nwars that the United Nations struggles mightily to quell \nor avoid are rooted in the ignorant and avaricious \ncartography of the European colonizers. \n The people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \nhave a long and proud history of resistance to slavery, \nbigotry and genocide, dating back to the heroic \nresistance of the Garifuna people against British \naggression in the late 1700s. While we celebrate the \nnoble heroism of the famous and the faceless alike who \nresisted racist colonial hegemony, we must continue to \nconfront the legacy of this barbarism and continuing \ninjustice. The wounds of that era are deep, the crimes \nagainst humanity are clear and the necessity for \napology and reparations is undeniable; we cannot duck \nthose. When we speak this year about the peoples of \nAfrican descent, we must highlight what is happening \nin the Horn of Africa and in Haiti.  \n The collective voices of the international \ncommunity are rising to a crescendo in support of full \nPalestinian statehood. Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines echoes the relevant portions of yesterday\u2019s \nGroup of 77 ministerial declaration, which welcomed \nthe State of Palestine\u2019s application for full membership \nin the United Nations. The State of Palestine has \nbrought its case to this world Assembly in keeping with \nthe finest traditions of multilateralism. No one should \ncall the Palestinian acts unilateral. They come here to \nthe multilateral body. We have no doubt that its action \nand the solidarity of the international community will \nresuscitate the moribund negotiating process between \nthe Palestinian and Israeli States. \n As I reflect on the sweeping geopolitical changes \nbeing wrought in our global village, I am compelled to \nraise the fact that there is no practical, legal or logical \njustification for the seeming indifference of the United \nNations to the meaningful participation of Taiwan in \nour important work. Surely, in the context of an ever-\nexpanding and inclusive United Nations, the 23 million \ncitizens of Taiwan can, at the very least, be allowed to \nmeaningfully participate in the specialized agencies of \nthe Organization \u2014 and that should extend beyond the \nWorld Trade Organization and the World Health \nAssembly.  \n Mr. Al-Nasser assumes the presidency amid a \ncyclone of international turbulence and change. We \nmay not be able to direct those winds, but we can, and \nmust, adjust our sails to harness the energy and the \npotential of this moment, while riding out the storms of \nuncertainty and upheaval. Former United States \nPresident Abraham Lincoln once said, in a different \ncontext:  \n  \u201cThe dogmas of the quiet past are \ninadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is \npiled high with difficulty, and we must rise with \nthe occasion. As our case is new, so we must \nthink anew and act anew.\u201d \n Our stormy present requires similar resolve, \ncreativity and action. Let us rise to the occasion and \nfulfil the immense potential of this peaceful global \nAssembly. Into those swirling winds of change, let us \nraise the flag of inclusiveness, equality, peace, justice \nand development for all the peoples of the world to see. \nMay Almighty God continue to bless us all. \n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines for the statement he has \njust made."

        "file_text": "\nI sincerely greet all gathered here and offer \ncongratulations on the opening of the sixty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly. I congratulate His \nExcellency Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at this session \nand express confidence that the Assembly under his \nleadership will work successfully and fruitfully. \n Allow me to convey my gratitude to Mr. Joseph \nDeiss, President at the sixty-fifth session, for his \n \n \n9 11-51185 \n \neffective activity in this post. In availing myself of this \nopportunity I should also like once again to \ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to \nthe post of Secretary-General and wish him great \nsuccess. \n As in past years, this forum is the continuation of \nthe process of forming suitable approaches to the \ncomplex phenomena of the modern world \u2014 in other \nwords, a search for appropriate answers to questions \nhaving global significance. It becomes more and more \nevident that there is a demand for systemic measures \nbased on a clear definition of goals, a vision of their \npossible implementation and a choice of effective \ninternational mechanisms.  \n Turkmenistan formulates these goals as follows: \npeace through development. Today these concepts \ncannot be considered separately. The direct connection \nbetween peace and development is exactly what opens \nwide possibilities for the consolidation of political will \nand the intellectual and material resources of the \ncommunity of nations. That is important in order to \nestablish sustainable, stable and, at the same time, \nflexible and balanced modern systems of international \nties in politics, economics and in the humanitarian \nsphere.  \n We are convinced that this large-scale issue and \nthe responsibility for its implementation lie first and \nforemost with the United Nations. Turkmenistan acts \naccordingly in forming its approaches to the issues of \nachieving a firm peace and security, implementing the \ndevelopment goals and realizing humanitarian \ncooperation.  \n Considering that a fundamental condition for \nensuring long-term peace and strategic stability is to \nefficiently abide by the United Nations Charter, \nTurkmenistan pursues a steady and purposeful policy \nof peace and good-neighbourliness and actively \nencourages peaceful processes. We absolutely reject \nmilitary force as an instrument of foreign policy and \nintergovernmental relations. We believe that solutions \nthrough armed force do not offer prospects for success, \ndo not eliminate sources of and reasons for clashes or \ncontradictions, and in most cases do not create \nconditions for supplying appropriate answers to many \nquestions that arise in post-conflict periods.  \n Turkmenistan attaches paramount importance to \nthe settlement of any situation by peaceful means and \nmethods. In that connection and in compliance with the \nfundamental documents of the United Nations, we \nsuggest that at this session the Assembly start to \ndevelop a declaration on the critical introduction of \npolitical and diplomatic tools for the resolution of \ninternational issues, with further consideration at \nsubsequent sessions. To our way of thinking, adopting \nsuch a declaration would allow for a considerable \ndecrease in the probability of the use of force to \nresolve clashes in intergovernmental relations. It would \nhelp to reduce the risks concerned and threats to \ngeneral stability and security.  \n At the regional level, we have proposed a number \nof initiatives on maintaining peace and stability in \nCentral Asia and in the Caspian basin. These initiatives \nwere welcomed positively. In our opinion, the next step \nmust be taken, namely, to arrange a representative \nforum on security in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea \nregion. Turkmenistan suggests hosting this event next \nyear. We believe that the establishment of an advisory \ncouncil on peaceful development in Central Asia and \nthe Caspian Sea region may emerge as one of the \npolitical outcomes of that forum. \n In talking of the necessity to ensure security on a \nglobal scale, we do not mean only its political \ncomponent. Global security is considered as a \ncomprehensive whole, based on indivisibility and a \nwhole range of key factors that define the vectors of \ntoday\u2019s worldwide development. That involves the \nsolution of economic, energy, ecological, food and \nhumanitarian issues.  \n Today it is obvious that global security cannot be \nprovided unless peace and consent at national and \nregional levels are reached. Therefore Turkmenistan \naims its efforts at the maximum promotion of the \nprocesses of sustainable development, attaining the \nMillennium Development Goals and creating efficient \nmodels of multilateral reciprocal action for the solution \nof urgent international issues.  \n A reliable and stable transit of energy resources \non the international market is one of the issues at hand. \nOur proposals on the matter received support from the \nworld community and were reflected in General \nAssembly resolution 63/210, adopted in 2008. I believe \nthat the time has come to start developing concrete \nmeasures on the resolution of energy transport issues. \n With a view to joining the efforts of the Member \nStates that are taking an active part in the development \nof an international legal foundation in the sphere of \n  \n \n11-51185 10 \n \nenergy supply, Turkmenistan considers it appropriate to \ncreate a new mechanism, transparent and open to all: \nan interregional energy dialogue under the aegis of the \nUnited Nations, supposing that the Organization would \nactively promote establishment of an essential format \nof cooperation. We see the States of Central and South \nAsia, the Caspian, the Black Sea and Baltic regions, \nRussia, China, the European Union and the countries of \nthe Middle and Near East \u2014 all States, companies and \ninternational financial institutions concerned \u2014 being \namong its participants. The acknowledgment by United \nNations Member States of the general nature of the \nlong-term goals of development and a readiness to \nachieve their implementation jointly act today as \ndetermining factors for the sustainability of the global \neconomic system. \n The serious effects of the worldwide financial \nand economic crisis have clearly demonstrated once \nagain the need to unite efforts to form viable models \nand realistic plans, taking account of the interests and \nneeds of all States of the world. Turkmenistan will take \nan active part in this process and will contribute to the \nexchange of successful experiences gained by our \ncountry on a number of fronts involving economic and \nsocial development.  \n We are ready to do this through the relevant \nUnited Nations structures, first of all the Economic and \nSocial Council. Our country submits its candidature for \nmembership in that authoritative body for the term of \n2013-2015. We are preparing for the work in this body, \nand, if elected, Turkmenistan will spare no efforts to \nsuccessfully implement the tasks entrusted. \n Turkmenistan will also take part in the Rio+20 \nEarth Summit in 2012. We see it as a landmark event in \nthe process of making progress towards sustainable \ndevelopment objectives. We intend to announce a \nnumber of specific proposals at that forum.  \n With regard to maintaining sustainable economic \ngrowth, I should like to dwell on a crucial component, \nnamely, the creation of a modern transport \ninfrastructure.  \n Over the years our country, together with partners \nin the region, has been actively working on the \nimplementation of major projects to optimize traffic \nflow in the Eurasian sphere. We believe this is a very \npromising area, given the huge potential of the north-\nsouth and east-west corridors. It is important that those \ncorridors, which could give a powerful impetus to \neconomic development and trade relations on a \ncontinental scale, be used effectively. We believe that \nthe United Nations could play an important role in \ncoordinating the establishment of international \ncooperation in the field of transport.  \n In that regard, Turkmenistan suggests that there \nbe an initiative, during the current session, to start \ndeveloping a United Nations special programme on the \ndevelopment of transport, including the study of transit \nand transport opportunities between the Caspian and \nBlack Seas and between Central Asia and the Middle \nEast. \n Turkmenistan sees the environmental sphere as a \nkey area for international cooperation. We respect the \ninitiatives and decisions taken at the summits on \nclimate change in Copenhagen and Cancun. We are \nlooking forward to continuing a constructive \ninternational dialogue on this issue in November this \nyear at the meeting in Durban. We are convinced of the \nneed to join efforts in this field at the global, regional \nand national levels and to coordinate the actions of \neach United Nations Member State. In that connection \nI should like to emphasize that Turkmenistan is \ncurrently preparing an extensive document, the \nNational Strategy on Climate Change. After the \nadoption of the Strategy we will be ready to submit it \nto the relevant United Nations agencies as a \ncontribution to our common work. We believe that it \nwill be possible, during the current session and in the \ncontext of closer multilateral cooperation, to start \nestablishing systemic machinery in this area. To that \nend, Turkmenistan proposes establishing a specialized \ninstitution \u2014 a United Nations interregional centre on \ndevelopment and issues related to climate change. We \nare willing to provide for its functioning with all the \nnecessary infrastructure in the capital of Turkmenistan, \nAshgabat. \n A most important question that goes far beyond \nregional boundaries is the environment of the Caspian \nSea. Here we are also convinced of the need to give \nspecific content to international efforts to preserve the \nunique natural resources of the Caspian Sea. In that \nregard we propose organizing a Caspian environmental \nforum as a permanent body to deal with environmental \nissues in the Caspian basin, as well as to make \nappropriate proposals and recommendations. \n Achieving sustainable development is directly \nrelated to the resolution of humanitarian issues, support \n \n \n11 11-51185 \n \nfor natural human rights, and opportunities for \nindividuals to achieve personal fulfilment and for \npeople to lead valuable lives. In that regard our country \nwill continue its cooperation with United Nations \nhumanitarian bodies for further implementation of \nUnited Nations conventions in the field of human \nrights. As a permanent member of the Executive \nCommittee of the Office of the High Commissioner for \nRefugees (UNHCR), Turkmenistan will actively \npromote the implementation of practical measures \naimed at protecting and supporting refugees. We have \nfound it useful, in working with UNHCR, to study our \nexperience in granting citizenship to refugees and \nstateless persons and to organize, in that connection, an \ninternational meeting involving all stake-holders in \nAshgabat in 2012. \n The challenges facing the Organization are \ncomplex and ambitious, but they are realistic and \nachievable because we have a common goal, namely, to \nmake the world a better, fairer and more humane place. \nWe are united by common values and shared \nresponsibility. We are united in our endeavour to move \nforward. We rely on the vast experience gained by the \nUnited Nations over the decades, as well as on the will, \nintellect and wisdom of the community of nations. All \nof this will determine the extent of our overall success. \nToday each country makes its own unique contribution \nto the development and progress of mankind. This \nopens up enormous opportunities for creating and \nimplementing new ideas, for developing innovative \nmodels of cooperation to address key issues in modern \ntimes. Turkmenistan is ready to take an active part in \nthis activity, firmly following a strategic course aimed \nat close and comprehensive cooperation with the \nUnited Nations."

In a similar vein, I \nthank His Excellency Joseph Deiss for his leadership \nof the sixty-fifth session. I also take this opportunity to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \nreappointment as Secretary-General. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \nextend a warm and hearty welcome to the community \nof nations to the Republic of South Sudan following its \nindependence on 9 July. We commend both the \nGovernments of the Sudan and the Republic of South \nSudan for the smooth transition during the handover \nand takeover of power. Zambia encourages the two \ncountries to resolve the outstanding issues between \nthem amicably and to work towards maintaining \npeaceful relations, as that is the only way to achieve \neconomic and social development. \n The theme for the sixty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means\u201d, is indeed a \npertinent one, considering the various conflicts across \nthe globe that threaten international peace and security. \nThe recent upheavals in North Africa and the Middle \nEast not only present a new dimension to politics in \nthat region but also highlight the need for mediation to \navert the outbreak of fighting. \n My delegation wishes to underscore the need for \nthe international community to resolve conflicts on the \nAfrican continent, including the situation in Libya, \nwithin the frameworks established by the African \nUnion. We believe that local solutions have a higher \nprospect of being respected and accepted by all parties \nto the conflict. \n In this regard, Zambia aligns itself with the \nmediation efforts put in place by the African Union and \nsupports the Roadmap for the Resolution of the Crisis \nin Libya endorsed by the African Union heads of State \nand Government at their seventeenth Summit held in \n  \n \n11-51681 22 \n \nMalabo, Equatorial Guinea, this year. With regard to \nLibya, Zambia shares the relief of the Libyan people in \nridding themselves of a leader who committed \negregious atrocities against his people.  \n We must, however, express serious concern about \nnew atrocities being committed against black people in \nthat country \u2014 both citizens and migrants from African \ncountries. We call on this body to send a strong \nmessage that it will not only pursue perpetrators of \nsuch atrocities as vigorously as it did Al-Qadhafi but \nalso undertake to investigate all allegations thoroughly. \nIt would be tragic if, in the euphoria of celebrating the \nousting of Al-Qadhafi, the United Nations turned a \nblind eye to atrocities still being committed. \n The Palestinian-Israeli conflict continues to be a \nmajor concern to international peace and security. We \nunderstand the frustrations of the Palestinian people \nover the long negotiations, which have completely \nstalled in recent years. In that regard, I wish to reaffirm \nthat Zambia recognizes the Palestinian State, with pre-\n1967 borders and East Jerusalem as its capital. In a \nsimilar vein, Zambia recognizes the State of Israel and \nits right to live in peace with its Palestinian neighbour. \n The drought situation in the Horn of Africa \npresents a humanitarian emergency that threatens the \nlives of 12 million people. While erratic rainfall in past \nyears is the main cause of the drought, the prevalent \npolitical instability and violence in Somalia has \nhampered that country\u2019s ability to effectively respond \nto the crisis. Zambia has pledged to donate several \nmetric tons of various food items and cash from the \nGovernment and the private sector.  \n The need to address the political instability and \nviolence in Somalia continues to be urgent. We \ntherefore call upon the United Nations to implement \nthe recommendations of the Special Representative of \nthe Secretary-General for Somalia, in which he called \nfor the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping \nmission there. \n Exactly one week ago, on 20 September, general \nelections took place in my country. On Friday, three \ndays later, the fifth and newest President of the \ncountry, Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata, was inaugurated. \nThe incumbent President graciously conceded and \nhanded over power. It was smooth and peaceful. It was \na triumph for democracy in my country. Zambia \nstrongly believes in the rule of law and is concerned at \ntrends towards unconstitutional changes of \nGovernment \u2014 trends that in some cases receive the \nactive support of powerful countries in the \ninternational community. \n The political stability that Zambia has and \ncontinues to enjoy has had a positive impact on the \neconomic development of the country. Over the past \ndecade real gross domestic product growth has \naveraged 5.4 per cent. While that growth has reflected \neffective macroeconomic management and good \ncopper prices, it has also been built on the foundation \nof Zambia\u2019s stable political environment and improved \nrecord of governance. In 2011, we expect to \nconsolidate that strong performance with growth now \nprojected to be above 7 per cent, second only to the \nprojected growth rates of 9.2 per cent for developing \nAsia and significantly above the projected 5.5 per cent \ngrowth rate for sub-Saharan Africa. \n Those economic trends notwithstanding, Zambia \nstill faces the challenge of translating its economic \ngrowth into a significant reduction in poverty and a \ngeneral improvement in the living standards of its \ncitizenry. It is our intention for the benefits of \neconomic growth to be broadly shared by the \npopulation at large. We hope to achieve that by \ncontinuing to strengthen our governance institutions, \nmaintaining peace and stability and ensuring that we \nremain open to the opportunities that global trade and \nthe exchange of ideas and experiences offer to a \ndeveloping economy. \n The country\u2019s economic development agenda is \nguided by the National Vision, under which Zambia \naspires to be a prosperous middle-income country by \n2030. The national agenda has been operationalized \nthrough five-year national development plans. \nCurrently the country is operating under its Sixth \nNational Development Plan, under the theme \n\u201cSustained economic growth and poverty reduction\u201d. \nWith these achievements, Zambia is on course to \nachieve five of the eight targets of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2011. \n In four years the MDG target date will be upon \nus. While Zambia has made notable progress towards \nachieving the 2015 MDG targets, particularly in terms \nof increased access to education, reduced maternal, \ninfant and under-5 mortality rates and child nutrition, \nthose achievements risk being reversed, pushing the \ncountry off track, owing to the multifaceted negative \nimpacts of the world economic recession, unfulfilled \n \n \n23 11-51681 \n \ncommitments and ever diminishing levels of financial \nassistance from cooperation partners. Under the \ncircumstances, many developing countries are unlikely \nto meet the MDG targets. It is therefore important not \nonly that every effort should be made to assist \ncountries stay on track but that we start planning for a \npost-2015 MDG framework. \n Beyond the challenges posed by infectious \ndiseases, Zambia is also affected by the emerging \nglobal trend of non-communicable diseases. The \nsocio-demographic and technological transition that \ngoes with urbanization and industrialization has \nresulted in an increase in non-communicable diseases \nin our country. I would therefore like to commend \nPresident Al-Nasser for hosting the High-level Meeting \non the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable \nDiseases. My delegation is, nevertheless, cautious that \nwhile focusing on non-communicable diseases, \nresources meant for infectious diseases, such as \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, should be \nsecured, so that the gains already achieved in these \nareas are not lost. \n Allow me to express Zambia\u2019s gratitude to the \nSecretary-General for organizing the High-level \nMeeting on addressing desertification, land \ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty eradication on 20 September \n2011. There is no doubt that the United Nations \nConvention to Combat Desertification is the least \nsupported of the three Rio Conventions, the others \nbeing the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change and the Convention on Biological \nDiversity. It is in that light that the convening of the \nHigh-level Meeting, as a means of raising awareness \nabout desertification, land degradation and drought at a \nhigh level, is most welcome. There is clearly a need for \nconcerted efforts on the part of all Member States to \nraise the profile of the Desertification Convention to \nthe level of the other two. \n Zambia views desertification and land \ndegradation as a major economic, social and \nenvironmental problem that requires immediate \nattention. It is in that regard that my country\u2019s sixth \nnational development plan, for 2011 to 2015, has \nendeavoured to mainstream environmental management in \ngeneral and sustainable land management in particular. \nThe challenge now is for Zambia to mobilize adequate \nand predictable financial resources to implement the \nprogrammes contained in the plan. The mobilization of \nresources for implementing programmes to combat \ndesertification and mitigate the effects of drought is an \nobligation shared by all Member States, including \nthose unaffected by desertification, as is spelled out in \nthe Convention, in Agenda 21 and in the Johannesburg \nPlan of Implementation of the World Summit on \nSustainable Development, among others.  \n We therefore call for the judicious \nimplementation of the outcome decisions of the \nrecently held High-level Meeting on desertification and \nland degradation. We also call on all States to ensure \nthat adequate financial resources are available for \nprogrammes aimed at combating desertification and \nmitigating the effects of drought. \n Turning to the topical subject of climate change, \nwhose adverse effects are responsible for exacerbating \ndesertification, land degradation and drought, the need \nto put in place a new and dynamic international regime \nfor climate change has never been so urgent. The \nadverse effects of climate change are being borne \ndisproportionately by poor countries such as my own. \nThe effects of climate change are real and are already \naffecting our agriculture, water, and infrastructure, to \nmention only some sectors. Yet, as we have repeatedly \nsaid, it is rich countries that are responsible for the \nhistoric build-up of greenhouse gases in our \natmosphere, the problem that has brought about global \nwarming and climate change. The developed world \nshould therefore show leadership when it comes to \nagreeing on a new international regime on climate \nchange. \n Zambia looks forward to the forthcoming United \nNations Climate Change Conference to be held in \nDurban, South Africa, in December. We are confident \nthat these talks will build on the positive outcome of \nthe last Conference, held in Canc\u00fan, last December. \nAfrica, which is hosting such talks for the first time, is \ndetermined to ensure a successful outcome. Time is \nrunning out and we can no longer afford the luxury of \ninconclusive talks each year. We call on all parties to \ncommit to making progress and ensuring that \nagreement is reached on all outstanding issues so as to \npave the way for a new climate change regime. We also \ncall for the immediate operationalization of all funds \nestablished so far under the Climate Change \nConvention, thereby making financial resources \naccessible to countries in need. \n  \n \n11-51681 24 \n \n The High-level Meeting to commemorate the \ntenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban \nDeclaration and Programme of Action was a timely \nreminder to all nations to continue to promote the \nrights of all people regardless of race or creed as equal \ncitizens of the world. Zambia recommits itself to the \njust cause of fighting against any form of racism or \nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related \nintolerance. \n With the year 2012 very much in sight, Zambia \nhopes for a successful conclusion to negotiations on \nthe arms trade treaty. A strong and robust treaty will \nhelp foster regional and international peace and \nsecurity. Zambia also supports an arms trade treaty that \nencompasses all conventional weapons, including \nsmall arms and light weapons and their ammunition; \ncomponents of weapons; dual-use equipment with a \nmilitary end-use; and arms production equipment and \ntechnology. Furthermore, Zambia advocates an arms \ntrade treaty with a broad scope that includes landmines \nand conventional weapons already covered by \ninternational weapon-specific agreements, as well as \ntechnical support. \n Last Friday the President of Sierra Leone, in his \ncapacity as Coordinator of the African Union \nCommittee of Ten Heads of State on Security Council \nreform, reminded the Assembly of the need to hasten \nnegotiations on this important issue. Zambia aligns \nitself with that statement and sentiment. It is a fact that \nAfrica is now one of the largest regions represented in \nthe United Nations, with 54 members, the same \nnumber as Asia. It is also a fact that three-quarters of \nthe issues on the Security Council\u2019s agenda are African \nissues.  \n Unfortunately, it is also a fact that Africa is the \nonly continent with no representation in the permanent-\nmembership category of the Council. In addition, \nAfrica is underrepresented in the non-permanent-\nmember category. Africa\u2019s request for two permanent \nseats, with all the rights and obligations of current \nmembers, and for two additional non-permanent seats, \nis a matter of justice and the right to have an equal say \nin the decision-making on issues that concern our \ncontinent. It is also a matter of democracy. Above all, it \nis about the dignity of a people and the dignity of a \ncontinent."

        "file_text": "Luxembourg is very pleased that the President of the \nEuropean Council, Herman Van Rompuy, was able for \nthe first time to address this Assembly on behalf of the \nEuropean Union (see ), and I align myself \nfully with his statement. \n Never before has the United Nations been so \nindispensable; never before have expectations of it \nbeen so great. We are going through a period of great \nturbulence; a period, as the Secretary-General has said, \nburdened by great difficulties, but also rich in \nopportunity for the progress of humankind. It is our \nduty to respond to the expectations placed on us by all \nthose across the world who seek peace, security and \ndignity. \n On 9 July 2011 a new State was born before the \neyes of the entire world. In January, during their \nreferendum on independence, the people of South \nSudan spoke loudly and clearly. More than 98 per cent \nof the electorate voted for the independence to which \nthe southern part of Africa\u2019s largest country had \naspired for so long. Luxembourg is proud to have \nrecognized South Sudan on 9 July, even before the \nhistoric moment of its admission to the United Nations. \n The independence of South Sudan is a testament \nto the willingness of the two parties in the long \nSudanese conflict to implement the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement. It is now up to both parties to show \nthe same willingness to implement new agreements to \naddress the issues of good-neighbourly relations \nbetween the Sudan and South Sudan. The two Sudans, \nand their peoples first of all, will benefit if the \nrelationship finally becomes a constructive one, \nallowing for socio-economic development on a new \nbasis.  \n The international community stands ready to \nsupport both countries. The development of the Sudan \nand support of the new State of South Sudan on its path \nto viability, stability and prosperity are tasks that we \nmust all tackle together and cooperatively. The \nEuropean Union is actively engaged. Luxembourg fully \nsupports its efforts and is also committed bilaterally, \nparticularly regarding demining activities to help \nremove the vestiges of a war that was so long that it \nhas marked several generations of Sudanese. \n A few days ago, in recognizing the full powers of \nLibya\u2019s National Transitional Council, the Assembly \nblessed, in a way, the end of Colonel Al-Qadhafi\u2019s \ndictatorial regime, one that suffocated the whole of \nLibyan society for 42 years and did not hesitate to use \n  \n \n11-51378 2 \n \nheavy weapons against its own population without \ndiscrimination, trampling on its people\u2019s aspirations for \nfreedom. \n The international community had to react, to \nassume its responsibility to protect Libyan men, \nwomen and children who were under fire \u2014 and who, \nunfortunately, are still under fire in Sirte and Bani \nWalid. We did not want to reproach ourselves yet again \nfor having hesitated too long, for having neglected our \nresponsibility to protect those unable to defend \nthemselves against the cruelty of their own authorities. \nWe did not want once again to be the powerless \nwitnesses of large-scale violence.  \n Our Organization was able to react and \ndemonstrate its capacity to act in a decisive, timely and \njust manner. The General Assembly suspended Libya \nfrom the Human Rights Council. Acting within the \nremit of Chapter VII of the Charter, the Security \nCouncil authorized all measures necessary to protect \nthe population and civilian areas under threat of attack. \nThe Council was able to act so decisively because the \ninternational community, and the region in particular, \nsupported its action. The Arab League played a very \nimportant role in this regard, which I heartily \ncommend. \n Today, thanks to their courage and the resolute \nsupport of the international community, the Libyan \npeople are free to choose their future. Together with \nour European Union partners, we stand ready to \nsupport Libya on its path to democracy and to help the \nNational Transitional Council in its immense task of \nestablishing a new State, in which human rights are \nrespected and every element of society can find a \nplace. As Mr. Jean Ping, who was President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, put it so \nwell in Paris on 1 September, Africa will benefit \nenormously from the emergence of a democratic Libya, \nat peace with itself and with its neighbours. We will all \nbenefit from it. \n In Tunisia and in Egypt, the people have also \nprevailed in their quests for liberty and the rewriting of \nthe social contract, in the face of the supporters of their \nformer regimes. In other countries in the region, people \nmust, alas, continue to struggle to achieve respect for \ntheir fundamental freedoms.  \n In Syria, the regime continues to conduct a brutal \ncampaign against its own population. Every appeal, \nincluding that of the Secretary-General, to end the \nviolence and repression has so far remained \nunanswered. As the Human Rights Council on \n23 August decided, commendably, to send urgently an \nindependent international commission of inquiry to \nSyria, the Security Council should also assume its \nresponsibility in the matter. The credibility of the \nUnited Nations as a moral force, one that protects \ncivilian populations and their rights, is at stake. \nEqually at stake is the capacity of the United Nations \nto be present in crises, revolts and disasters that assault \npeoples\u2019 dignity and threaten their very existence. \n Peace, security, dignity \u2014 these are also key \nwords when we talk about the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict: the right of two peoples to live in peace, \nsecurity and dignity.  \n A solution to this conflict, which has lasted too \nlong and has poisoned the entire region, must \nnecessarily be reached through the recognition of the \nright of both parties \u2014 not just one of them \u2014 to live \nin a sovereign and viable State. This is unfortunately \nnot yet the case, despite the hope inspired by the \ncourageous words of President Obama at this very \nrostrum last year (see A/65/PV.11). On the contrary, we \nhave seen neither a halt to the illegal construction of \nsettlements, nor a significant lifting of the embargo on \nthe Gaza strip. The revival of direct peace talks was \nshort-lived. \n We all heard Palestinian President Mahmoud \nAbbas\u2019s vibrant appeal yesterday, his call for \nrecognition of the his people\u2019s legitimate right to a \nState and for acceptance of the aspirations of Palestine \nto have a seat in the Assembly and to fully assume its \nplace among the nations of the world. I can only hope \nthat his appeal will be heard. Israel\u2019s legitimate desire \nto live for the long term in security depends on the \nrealization of the right of the Palestinians to live in \ndignity in their sovereign State. \n But merely responding to this appeal is not \nenough. It is imperative that negotiations between the \ntwo parties start again as soon as possible. Only \nnegotiations will allow tackling the root causes of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. The parameters for a \nsettlement have been known for a long time. I fully \nsupport the proposal made yesterday by the Quartet for \na strict timetable: one month to agree on the agenda \nand modalities of the negotiations, and no more than a \nyear to reach a comprehensive agreement.  \n \n \n3 11-51378 \n \n I appeal to the parties to show proof of their \npolitical will and ability to make the necessary \ncompromises and sacrifices so that by the end of 2012 \npeace in the Middle East finally becomes a reality. \nFrom this rostrum, I reiterate firmly that the restart of \nnegotiations cannot again stumble over cement and \nstones, and I dare believe that the Israeli Government \nknows that. In their efforts both now and in the future, \nthe parties can count on the nations of the European \nUnion, including my country, Luxembourg. \n The events over the past year in North Africa, the \nMiddle East and sub-Saharan Africa remind us of the \nimportance of a United Nations Organization with solid \nmeans for prevention and mediation, for peacekeeping \nand peacebuilding. Conflict prevention is one of the \nprincipal obligations set out in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. Primary responsibility for that belongs \nto Member States, but no State can act alone. Each \nmust be able to count on the support of the rest.  \n At the 2005 World Summit, we all committed to \npromoting a culture of prevention, and we put in place \nimportant new tools and mechanisms. The \nPeacebuilding Commission, by uniting all concerned \nactors and formulating integrated strategies, is an \nessential element of these. \n My country is deeply convinced of the relevance \nof a broad and multidimensional approach to \npeacebuilding. Luxembourg is proud to be an active \ncontributor to the work of the Peacebuilding \nCommission, notably as Chair of the country-specific \nconfiguration for Guinea established this February. Our \npriority is to support the authorities in Conakry in the \nareas of national reconciliation, security sector reform \nand employment for women and young people. Since \n2010 Luxembourg, in its national capacity, has been \nsupporting mediation conducted by the Community of \nSant\u2019Egidio between the main political and civil \nsociety actors in Guinea. \n Both at the bilateral level and in its capacity as a \nmember of the European Union, Luxembourg sees \nconflict prevention and providing support in post-\nconflict situations as being at the heart of its activity \nabroad, primarily through multilateral instruments, \nwith the United Nations, naturally, first and foremost \namong them. The challenges we face are not limited to \npolitical conflicts but also concern economic, social \nand environmental transformation.  \n Let us remember that the Arab Spring began with \nan act of social protest. We therefore agree entirely \nwith the priority that the President intends to give \nduring his mandate to sustainable development, \npoverty eradication and achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n With our European Union partners, we will do \neverything in our power to contribute ensuring that the \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20), which will take place in Brazil \nless than a year from now, in June 2012, is truly \nsuccessful. Rio+20 must set a range of ambitious goals \nthat will ensure that we stay on track with sustainable \ndevelopment and preserve future generations\u2019 ability to \nlive on our planet.  \n Sustainable development, in its three elements \u2014 \neconomic, social and environmental \u2014 has long been \nat the centre of Luxembourg\u2019s development \ncooperation policy. I am happy to say that Luxembourg \nhas managed to maintain and even increase its efforts \nin terms of official development assistance, which in \n2010 reached 1.09 per cent of our gross national \nproduct. \n We no longer need to prove the close link \nbetween security and development. For Luxembourg, \nthe links between security and climate change are \nequally obvious. As the Secretary-General observed, \nclimate change must be seen as a threat multiplier. \nLuxembourg\u2019s commitment to combating climate \nchange, including through the Group of Friends created \nhere in New York for that purpose, is also part of our \nstrategy for preventing conflicts before climate change \nmakes them worse. In that context, my country offers \nsupport and technical assistance to small island \ndeveloping States, particularly those in the Pacific, \nwhose existence is threatened by climate change. \n Since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, \nLuxembourg, together with its European partners, has \nmade binding commitments to reduce its carbon \nemissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. \nLuxembourg is also contributing to the fast start \nfinance initiative in order to tackle climate change. I \nshould stress that these resources are new and \nadditional to our official development assistance. \n Among the numerous other challenges that \nrequire a coordinated and collective response, I should \nlike to mention one in particular: the prevention and \ncontrol of non-communicable diseases. Non-communicable \n  \n \n11-51378 4 \n \ndiseases not only cost 36 million human lives every year; \nthey also result in significant losses to national revenue \nand pull millions of people below the poverty line. \nThey affect all of us and are having an increasingly \npreponderant impact on developing countries. The \nresponse to this challenge of epidemic proportions \nmust be global and universal. \n I therefore commend the initiative on the part of \nthe Caribbean Community countries to put this subject \non the General Assembly\u2019s agenda and to publicize, \nbeyond the medical community, the scope and impact \nof the crisis in non-communicable diseases, including \nin development terms. There is no question that the \ndebate in the High-level Meeting on the Prevention and \nControl of Non-communicable Diseases, the round \ntables and the various side events held in the last few \ndays have allowed us to reach that goal. We should \nnow fully implement the commitments undertaken in \nthe Political Declaration (resolution 66/2, annex). I can \nassure the Assembly that Luxembourg will continue its \nefforts to that end at the national, regional and \ninternational levels. \nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, \nwhose tenth anniversary we have just commemorated, \nwere attacks against not only the United States, the \nhost country of our Organization, but against all of us, \nagainst our values and principles, our convictions and \nbeliefs. Our Organization itself has become the target \nof cowardly attacks. Such despicable acts must not, \nhowever, lead us to turn inward. On the contrary, they \nshould encourage us to redouble efforts to continue to \nact together in furthering the ideals and values of our \nOrganization and its Charter, to fight together against \nterrorism and for a better and safer future for \ngenerations to come, for development and respect for \nhuman rights, for democracy and the rule of law. That \nis our joint responsibility: the responsibility to prevent, \nto preserve and to protect. \n Luxembourg stands ready to shoulder its \nresponsibilities and to continue to work for an effective \nmultilateralism, including \u2014 if the Assembly affords \nus the opportunity \u2014 as a non-permanent member of \nthe Security Council in 2013-2014."

        "file_text": "Allow me at \nthe outset to convey the regrets of His Excellency \nMr. Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, President of the Republic \nof Mali, who, owing to a particularly busy national \nschedule at this time, was unable to attend the current \nsession of the General Assembly. However, he asked \nme to convey his most cordial greetings and sincere \nwishes for the success of our work. \n The Mali delegation is particularly pleased to \nconvey to Mr. Al-Nasser its heartfelt congratulations \non his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. His election is not \nonly a just recognition of his exceptional qualities as a \nseasoned diplomat, but also a tremendous tribute to his \ncountry, Qatar, with which Mali enjoys excellent \nrelations. I therefore assure him of the support and full \ncooperation of my delegation in discharging his \nmission. Allow me also to express my great \nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for \nthe superb manner in which he presided over the sixty-\nfifth session, which has just ended, to the satisfaction \nof all Member States.  \n Finally, I should like to congratulate Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his outstanding re-election as \nthe head of the Organization. I remain fully convinced \nthat his unswerving commitment to upholding the \nprinciples and ideals of the Organization and to the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \nwill help to strengthen further the role of the United \nNations on the international scene. \n The current global context is marked by profound \npolitical upheavals that gravely threaten international \npeace and security. This situation makes the theme \nchosen for the general debate \u2014 \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes\u201d \u2014 all \nthe more pertinent. I should therefore like first to stress \nthe important role of mediation and the urgency of \nrenewed collective efforts to prevent and resolve \nconflicts and, above all, to put a halt to violence, the \nuntold suffering inflicted on civilian populations, and \nthe massive destruction of socio-economic \ninfrastructure.  \n \n \n5 11-51197 \n \n My country remains convinced that the \nprevention of conflicts and their resolution through \nmediation are undoubtedly guarantees of peace and \nlasting security. In that regard, Mali will continue to \nencourage and support all initiatives and mediation \nefforts under way with a view to combating the root \ncauses of conflicts and paving the way to a lasting \npolitical solution able to guarantee peace, stability and \nsecurity, without which there can be no socio-economic \ndevelopment. Part of this process are the promotion of \ngood-neighbourly relations and peaceful coexistence, \nthe non-use of force in dispute settlement, \nunderstanding and mutual respect, the bolstering of \ninternational cooperation, and the culture of peace and \ndialogue among religions and civilizations. \n The events under way in the world are of concern \nto us in that they clearly demonstrate that the quest for \npeace and security remains the most pressing \nchallenge. In Africa, while outstanding progress has \nbeen made in promoting peace, security and stability, \nthe fact remains that the situation in the Horn of Africa \nand in North Africa, particularly in Libya, remains a \nsource of major concern. Today more than ever, \nweapons and deadly confrontations must give way to \nthe imperative of dialogue and national reconciliation, \nwhich are required to establish lasting peace, \nconsolidate national unity and maintain territorial \nintegrity. \n In the Middle East, the Palestinian question is \nand remains a source of major concern to the \ninternational community, which must encourage the \nIsraelis and Palestinians to take the steps necessary to \nestablish a climate of trust and launch direct \nnegotiations towards a comprehensive peace \nunderpinned, inter alia, on the relevant resolutions of \nthe General Assembly and the Security Council. While \nreiterating its active solidarity and total support to the \nPalestinian people in their just, legitimate struggle, \nMali will continue to support all initiatives towards the \ncreation of an independent, sovereign and viable \nPalestinian State living side by side and in peace with \nIsrael within secure, internationally recognized \nborders. \n International peace and security continue to be \nthreatened by other phenomena, such as international \nterrorism, cross-border organized crime, and the traffic \nin weapons, drugs and human beings. The attacks \nperpetrated throughout the world are stark reminders \nthat no country is safe from terrorism, and that no \ncause, howsoever just, can justify the deliberate use of \nviolence against innocent civilians.  \n In that regard, I note the security challenges in \nthe vast Sahelo-Saharan strip that Mali shares with \nseveral brother countries in the region. Our subregion \nfaces today the proliferation of small arms and light \nweapons and the trafficking of drugs and human beings \nfuelled by organized crime networks in collusion with \nterrorist groups. The events in Libya and their \ncollateral effects could further aggravate this already \nworrisome situation.  \n Aware of the threats posed by these phenomena to \nthe stability and harmonious development of the \nregion, the Governments of the countries concerned \nhave worked to establish joint operational mechanisms \nto combat our common enemies effectively. For its \npart, the Government of Mali reaffirms its full support \nfor all initiatives of the States of the subregion seeking \nto better coordinate and harmonize our efforts to meet \nthe multiple common challenges. Parallel to efforts at \nthe subregional level, our Government is intensifying \nits efforts to implement the Special Programme for \nPeace, Security and Development in Northern Mali. \n The year 2012 will be an important one for Mali. \nAfter almost 20 years of democratic institutional \npractices, the President of the Republic, who will not \nstand for re-election, saw fit to revise the 1992 \nConstitution, following broad national consultations, in \norder to consolidate democracy, good governance and \nthe rule of law in our country. \n A participative, inclusive process has already \nbeen opened with all stakeholders \u2014 the Government, \npolitical parties, national deputies and civil society \u2014 \nto guarantee the transparency and credibility of future \nreferendums and future. I reiterate the commitment of \nthe Government to do its utmost to smoothly \nimplement the envisaged reforms and meet the \nchallenge of holding successful elections in 2012. I \nremain confident of success as our democracy has \nmatured over the past four elections. This progress has \nbeen inspired from Malian culture based on dialogue, \ntolerance and sharing.  \n The people of Mali share the ambition of the \nGovernment to build a strong, united Mali \u2014 a \ndemocratic and stable Mali resolutely committed to \npeace, dialogue and international cooperation. They \nalso share the determination of the Government to \ncreate the conditions for true prosperity in order to \n  \n \n11-51197 6 \n \nmake Mali an emerging economy in the medium term. \nThat is why I solemnly call from this rostrum on the \ninternational community and development partners to \nsupport the electoral process under way and our efforts \nto meet the challenge of organizing a constitutional \nreferendum and free, transparent and democratic \nelections. \n As a Sahelo-Saharan country facing the \nphenomenon of desertification and unpredictable \nrainfall, Mali considers climate change to be one of the \nmajor challenges affecting the survival and \ndevelopment of humankind. That is why we are present \nat all meetings on this issue, as borne out by our recent \nparticipation at the High-level Meeting on the theme \n\u201cAddressing desertification, land degradation and \ndrought in the context of sustainable development and \npoverty eradication\u201d. I reaffirm Mali\u2019s commitment to \ncontinuing to step up its actions to preserve and \nconserve the soils, forests and fauna, in step with the \nnational and international commitments of our country. \n The sessions of the General Assembly also offer \nus a chance to take stock of the severity of other \nchallenges facing the world. I think in particular of the \nstruggle against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and \nnon-communicable diseases, which were the subject of \nHigh-level Meetings on 19 and 20 September. In \naddition to the challenges they pose to public health, \nthese scourges have become a real problem for \ndevelopment. The international community must, we \nbelieve, redouble its efforts and its vigilance to contain \nthese illnesses. It will also have to deliver on its \ncommitments to the developing countries in order to \nallow them to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals.  \n It is also important to give sustained attention to \nthe issue of reform and democratization of the United \nNations by giving a greater role to women in decision-\nmaking in political, economic and security forums. It is \nalso important to democratize the international \nfinancial institutions, bearing in mind the huge changes \nthat have taken place in the world and the need for \nbetter representation for all regions. \n The global economic situation certainly remains \nfragile, but the financial crisis should not become a \npretext for reducing official development assistance \n(ODA). The implementation of the Programme of \nAction for the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals must remain a priority. The \ninternational community must revive its collective will \nto put into practice and even go beyond commitments \nundertaken in the field of ODA in order to combat \npoverty and all forms of injustice that breed violence \nand insecurity throughout the world.  \n Similarly, the implementation of the Istanbul \nPolitical Declaration and Programme of Action for the \nleast developed countries (LDCs) for the decade 2011-\n2020 will allow the LDCs to marshal the necessary \nfinancial resources to ensure the lasting growth and \ndevelopment that guarantee peace and stability in the \nworld. In that regard, Mali will continue to support all \ninnovative initiatives in development financing, trade, \nthe alleviation of foreign debt, and technology transfer \nto developing countries in general and LDCS in \nparticular. \n In our quest for a safer and more just, prosperous \nand peaceful world, the best way to guarantee our \ncommon future is to strengthen cooperation and \ninternational solidarity. Let us engage collectively to \nfind lasting solutions to the challenges and complex \nproblems facing humankind. It is in the interest of us \nall and in the interest of our collective survival."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to be here \ntoday and to represent the brave and resilient people of \nPakistan before the Assembly. As participants may \nknow, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Syed Yusuf \nRaza Gilani, was due to visit New York and address \nthis House. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister could \nnot come owing to the humanitarian disaster caused by \nthe floods in Pakistan. Once again, I feel privileged to \nbe able to deliver the remarks of the Prime Minister to \nthe General Assembly. \n I bring to Mr. Al-Nasser and to all the nations of \nthe world assembled here salaam, peace and the \ngreetings and good wishes of the people of Pakistan. \nWe are delighted to be able to address the General \nAssembly under the leadership of Mr. Al-Nasser. This \nis an important session of the Assembly, and the State \nof Qatar is a truly deserving and able country for this \noccasion. The Pakistani people have intimate, brotherly \nrelations with his great country, and I speak for my \npeople in welcoming his presidential term. His election \nto this high office is as much a tribute to his \noutstanding qualities as it is to the high esteem in \nwhich his country is held in the comity of nations. \n Why are we here? Other than the allure of New \nYork City, why have we converged at the General \nAssembly? Pakistan is here because it believes in \nmultilateralism. Each September we return to this great \ncity and this grand stage so that we can restate and \nreaffirm the principles and values of multilateralism. It \nis and has been one of the abiding central tenets of our \nforeign policy. We are committed to the very idea of \nthe United Nations. \n To us, the idea is very simple. We can do more \ntogether than we can apart. We can solve complex \nproblems by consensus rather than through \nunilateralism. Multilateral cooperation can help us deal \nwith the spectrum of global challenges, old and new, in \nour interdependent world. As we grow more and more \ndependent on one another, the space for unilateralism \nand unidimensional answers to the most difficult \nquestions shrinks. Those who are sceptical of the future \nof multilateralism are living in the past. The future, our \ncollective global future, is, God willing, bright. It is the \nUnited Nations and multilateralism that will safeguard \nthat future. \n Pakistan believes in the promise of the United \nNations: a world free from the scourge of war; a world \ngoverned by rules and norms of civility, of decency, of \ngoodwill; creating a better future for the peoples of the \nworld; and inter-State conduct premised on the respect \nfor the immutable principles of the United Nations. We \nmust ensure that the United Nations is the best \nrepresentation of the aspirations of our peoples. \n We must do better. There is far too much distance \nbetween those aspirations and the sometimes dark \nrealities of our times. We are constantly struggling with \ndifficult choices and cycles: expediency versus values, \ninterests versus ideals. There is conflict, discord and \ndeath. Natural and man-made calamities spread fear \nand destitution among millions, and often exacerbate \nand expose already unacceptable levels of poverty and \ndeprivation. We face these challenges in every country. \nWe cannot afford to face them alone. The importance \nof togetherness and of our faith and collective \ncommitment to the ideals, principles and values of the \nUnited Nations cannot be overstated. \n Togetherness, or multilateralism, of course, does \nnot mean uniformity or conformity. It does not mean \nfalling in line. Instead, it means harmony, tolerance, \nrespect for diversity and a pragmatic, cognitive \nrealization that no one system, no single prescription, \nno one raah, or path, works for all. Each society, every \nculture offers a path for the march of mankind. \nPreconceived assumptions about the superiority of one \nway or the other must not be allowed to contaminate \nthe spirit of the United Nations. \n \n \n7 11-51681 \n \n Pakistan\u2019s oldest spiritual traditions and most \nbeloved poets and peers have taught us that there can \nbe no progress where the mind is divorced from the \nheart. Faith in the United Nations is a manifestation of \nthe best rational traditions and the most cherished \ntraditions of idealism and believing in something. We \nbelieve in the United Nations. The spirit of the United \nNations must permeate all our endeavours. The peoples \nof the world await the advent of the true age of the \nUnited Nations. We must reassert our promise to \ndeliver it. \n I would like to compliment the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his tireless efforts in \nbringing to bear the vast reservoir of goodwill, \ncompassion and common humanity of Member States \nin successfully addressing a wide array of challenges. \n On behalf of the people of Pakistan, I wish to \nconvey our grateful thanks to the Secretary-General \nand the international community for their support and \nsolidarity, expressed so generously in the wake of the \ndevastating floods last year. \n This year again, heavy monsoon rains have \ncaused widespread flooding. Millions have been \naffected, with about 5.4 million people rendered \nhomeless. Human and economic losses, as well as the \npressing requirements of relief and rehabilitation, \nobliged us to seek international assistance. We again \nthank the international community for its support and \nsolidarity. \n The Pakistani people continue to consistently \ndemonstrate their immense reservoir of courage, \nforbearance and generosity. God willing, we shall \novercome this misfortune through the same fortitude \nand resilience that our people have been blessed with. \n At this session of the General Assembly, Pakistan \nis seeking election to a seat on the Security Council. In \nsoliciting the support of President Al-Nasser, I wish to \nassure him that we would discharge our responsibilities \nwith utmost dedication to the high ideals and principles \nof the United Nations. \n Pakistan attaches the highest importance to \npromoting the goals of peace, security and stability in \nthe world. In our own region, we have relentlessly \nendeavoured to create an environment of shared \nprosperity and peace. A democratic, progressive and \nprosperous Pakistan embedded in a stable, secure and \nprosperous region guides the framework of our foreign \npolicy and could yield enormous benefits not only for \nthe peoples of our region but for those of the world as \nwell. \n We have reached out to our immediate \nneighbours with a sincere desire to join hands in \nbringing about durable peace and development through \na win-win approach. Situated as we are on the \ncrossroads of Central, South and West Asia, we realize \nthe enormous opportunities that ensue from pursuing \nwith diligence the vision of common development and \ncooperation. \n I am happy to note that both Pakistan and India \nare now engaged in a substantive dialogue process that \nwe in Pakistan hope will be uninterrupted and \nuninterruptible. We certainly intend to make that \nengagement fruitful and to premise it on the promise of \na mutually rewarding enterprise that would enable us \nto make the best use of the complementarities that \nexist. \n We look forward to resolving all outstanding \nissues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, \nwhich is among the oldest on the agenda of the United \nNations and the subject of several Security Council \nresolutions. A peaceful resolution that accords fully \nwith the aspirations of the Kashmiris is indispensable \nfor durable stability, as is the need to safeguard their \nfundamental human rights. \n The reality of a nuclearized South Asia imposes \nboth on Pakistan and on India the onerous \nresponsibility to work together to create mutual \nconfidence, avoid an arms race and enhance strategic \nstability. We look forward to moving in that direction \nin the dialogue process. \n Pakistan is also firmly committed to promoting \nstability and peace in Afghanistan. We respect and \nsupport the efforts of the Government of Afghanistan \nfor reconciliation and peace, under the leadership of \nPresident Karzai. \n We strongly condemn the terror attacks in Kabul, \nin which many precious lives were lost. We also \nexpress our sympathy to our brothers and sisters and \nthe leadership of Afghanistan on the tragic \nassassination of Mr. Burhanuddin Rabbani, former \nPresident and Chairman of the Afghan High Peace \nCouncil. Such cowardly attacks will never succeed in \ndeterring our proud Afghan brothers and sisters from \nrealizing the noble goals of reconciliation and peace. \n  \n \n11-51681 8 \n \n Pakistan fully supports an Afghan-led and \nAfghan-owned inclusive process of reconciliation and \npeace in Afghanistan. We want to see Afghanistan as a \nunited, independent and sovereign State. We urge all \nconcerned to join the reconciliation process. We also \ncall for a de-escalation and cessation of violence. \n The road ahead for peace in Afghanistan and our \nregion as a whole is full of challenges. The complexity \nof the situation and the ground dynamics need to be \nanalysed objectively and carefully. Clarity and \nstrategic coherence, especially among Afghanistan, the \nUnited States and Pakistan, are of the utmost \nimportance. It is for that reason that we attach \nimportance to the work of the Trilateral Core Group. \nWe also attach considerable importance to the \nAfghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission for \nReconciliation and Peace. \n It is only by charting a clear road map that we \nwill be able to bring about the necessary operational \npolicy coordination to achieve our shared goals and \nobjectives. Given the volatility of the situation, it is \nperhaps understandable that there is a high level of \nanxiety and emotion. However, we must not lose sight \nof the goals. We must work together closely and as \nresponsible partners in a cooperative manner, and not \nrush to judgements or question each other\u2019s intentions.  \n A cooperative endeavour, in full solidarity with \nthe people of Afghanistan, is the only way of ensuring \npeace, stability and prosperity in the region. Pakistan is \nwilling to do its best with international partners and, \nmost notably, the Governments of Afghanistan and the \nUnited States, to acquit itself of that high responsibility \nat this defining moment in one of the most important \nstruggles of our times. \n Pakistan has always upheld the realization of the \ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including \ntheir right to an independent homeland with Al-Quds \nAl-Sharif as its capital. Here, I would like to reaffirm \nour principled position. President Mahmoud Abbas \nmade an historic and memorable case for his people \n(see ). We stand by him and the Palestinian \npeople. We stand by our brothers and sisters, and we \nagree that the current situation is no longer sustainable. \nWe support the quest of the State of Palestine for \nmembership of the United Nations. \n In North Africa and the Middle East, we have \nwitnessed important developments. Pakistan believes \nthat the aspirations of the people must be \naccommodated peacefully, without external \ninterference and in a manner consistent with the \nprinciple of sovereignty, unity and the territorial \nintegrity of States. \n Very few countries have been ravaged by the \nmonster of terrorism as brutally as Pakistan. We are \nkeenly aware of the threat that terrorism poses to \nPakistan, to Pakistan\u2019s neighbours and to the rest of the \nworld. Some 30,000 innocent Pakistanis \u2014 men, \nwomen and children \u2014 have been killed. The ever-\nvaliant Pakistani armed forces have defended Pakistan \nand the rest of the world, at the highest cost. Our \ntroops have sacrificed 6,532 shuhada, or martyrs. \nSome 19,190 of our strongest, bravest and most \nhonourable boys have suffered injuries. It does not stop \nthere. We have seen 3,629 of our police and \nparamilitary personnel embrace shahadat, or \nmartyrdom. Since 2002, 10,720 of those men and \nwomen of the police and paramilitary services have \nbeen injured.  \n The grieving mothers, daughters, sisters and \nwives of those brave men and women are a constant \nreminder of our need to be vigilant and to fight the \nmenace of terrorism. Pakistan\u2019s most popular leader, \nShaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated \nin 2007. Numerous politicians have lost sons, brothers \nand fathers at the hands of terrorists. Our streets are \nfilled with armed police posts. We cannot enter our \nparks, shopping centres, churches or mosques without \nbeing searched and frisked. Terrorists have attacked \nour military installations, the grave sites of our \nspiritual leaders, our minorities and the very idea of \nPakistan. If I began recounting Pakistan\u2019s sacrifices \nand suffering, I would be here till next September. We \ndo not take terrorism lightly. We cannot afford to. We \nhave suffered far too much at its hands. \n Our nation is united in its determination to \neliminate the spectre of terrorism from our soil, our \nregion and the world. It is important to enhance \ninternational cooperation to totally obliterate terrorism \nin all its forms and manifestations. \n Our resolve is inspired by Allama Muhammad \nIqbal, the legendary poet philosopher, to whom \nPakistan owes a debt of gratitude. Iqbal said: \n \u201cThe eagle does not fall from its soaring height \n If you have the will, there is nothing to fear from \nadversity\u201d \n \n \n9 11-51681 \n \n Pakistan has the will. We do not fear adversity. It \nis Pakistan\u2019s firm determination not to allow any space \non its territory for militants and terrorists. On the \nregional plane, we must all pledge that our respective \nterritories will not be allowed to be used by terrorists \nagainst others. \n The issue of organizing, financing, arming, \nsupporting and abetting terrorist violence needs to be \naddressed seriously and effectively. Notable success \nagainst Al-Qaida and its affiliates has been registered \nin recent years. It is well known that, following the \nTora Bora bombing and consequent dispersal of \nAl-Qaida, it was Pakistan\u2019s intelligence and security \nagencies that interdicted a large number of Al-Qaida \noperatives. Very recently, Yusuf Al-Mauritani, the chief \noperative of Al-Qaida, was arrested in a joint Inter-\nService Intelligence and Central Intelligence Agency \noperation. \n We must demonstrate complete unity in ranks, \navoid any recrimination, build greater trust and, more \nimportant, bring about the requisite operational \ncoordination in combating the menace. Otherwise, I am \nafraid that terrorists are the only ones who will gain. \nEliminating terrorism is in our national interest. We \nbelieve that our success is critical to regional and \nglobal peace and security. \n Despite our limited capacity and constraints, we \nhave done all that we can towards realizing the vision \nof a bright future for our people and the peoples of \nAfghanistan and the region. We have actively \nadvocated and worked for closer regional economic \nintegration. We believe that, unless we prioritize \ndevelopment and create win-win scenarios in terms of \nmutually beneficial joint ventures in connectivity, \ninfrastructure, energy and trade, we cannot succeed in \nchanging the picture. We need to give hope and provide \na silver lining to those who have not seen peace for \nthree generations and have only taken up mercenarism \nand guns as a means of livelihood. \n Pakistan\u2019s commitment to eliminating terror and \nmilitancy is irrevocable. We believe that action to that \nend warrants a comprehensive approach that deals not \nonly with the violence, but also its root causes. That \nrequires enhancing international cooperation in \nmultiple domains. \n Pakistan has reached out to all countries of the \nworld to establish mechanisms and arrangements, \nincluding intelligence cooperation, mutual assistance in \nlegal and criminal matters, and joint operations where \nrequired. We believe that is a global issue which needs \nto be addressed effectively.  \n Pakistan supports initiatives to strengthen the \nUnited Nations. However it is important not to start \nanything that could prove divisive or potentially \nunravel the essential pillars of the United Nations. The \nprocess of Security Council reform must be carried out \nin a manner to reinforce the confidence of the world\u2019s \npeoples in that body and enhance its credibility and \neffectiveness. Such reform must enjoy the full \nconsensus of the international community and accord \nwith the fundamental principle of sovereign equality.  \n I remain committed to the vision of Pakistan\u2019s \nmartyred leader, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, \nwho reminded us time and again that selective morality \nis by definition, immoral, and that fundamental human \nvalues alone must guide our actions. \n Pakistan attaches high importance to United \nNations peacekeeping functions and is a major troop-\ncontributor to United Nations peacekeeping. Pakistan \nhas consistently been among the top United Nations \npeacekeeping contributors for many years. We have \nover 10,000 troops in the United Nations Blue \nHelmets. \n We also attach importance to United Nations \nwork in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. \nOur collective endeavours in those fields would show \nmore effective results if we could enhance security for \nall through non-selective and non-discriminatory \napproaches. Normative work must be premised on \nprinciples. \n We applaud the work of the United Nations in \nmultiple domains. The specialized organizations, \nbodies and institutions are veritable examples of \naccomplishments based on shared goals and broadened \nfields of cooperation. Pakistan played a leadership role \nin conceiving and piloting the One United Nations \nInitiative. That is a potentially vital actor in global \ndevelopment and aid effectiveness. Despite the Paris \nDeclaration and its reaffirmation at Accra, we have a \nlong way to go. The One United Nations Initiative in \nPakistan has struggled to achieve the lofty goals that it \nset, but we continue to invest hope in its eventual \nsuccess. \n Of course, the most important kind of \nharmonization is the one that takes place between \n  \n \n11-51681 10 \n \npeople, between hearts and minds, between nations. We \nplace immense importance on our ability to promote \nharmony and tolerance among and between societies, \ncultures, faiths and nations. We know the price to be \npaid when those values are breached, having lost the \nGovernor of our most populous province, Salmaan \nTaseer, and our valiant Minister for Minority Affairs, \nShahbaz Bhatti, to acts of violence perpetrated by \nextremists. For us, the process of harmony and \ntolerance begins at home, and we take it very seriously. \nWe are committed and our resolve is strong. \n At the international level, we are confident that \nthe United Nations provides the best global forum, as it \nis fully equipped to enhance understanding and \ngoodwill among all members of the international \ncommunity. Respect for beliefs, cultures and traditions \nare the hallmark of civilized conduct. We are \nparticularly concerned over campaigns that tend to \nstigmatize Islam and Muslims. Islam is a religion of \npeace. It is important that the international community \ncelebrate our common humanity and unity in diversity. \n The systemic fault lines in the global economic \nlandscape have surfaced lately and remain a source of \nimmense concern. The debt and financial crisis added \nanother worrying dimension to the existing disparity \nbetween developed and developing countries and \nhighlighted the need to promote holistic development \nand economic growth. That requires revisiting the \nfundamentals and readiness to equitably address the \nunderlying issues. \n As a democratic country committed firmly to the \nideals, values and principles of the United Nations, \nPakistan will continue to do its best for the cause of \nglobal peace and prosperity. Under the leadership of \nPresident Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Syed \nYusuf Raza Gilani, the Pakistani nation is moving \nahead, confident of itself and its enormous capabilities. \nAs a vibrant democracy, we are in the process of \naccomplishing a historic societal transformation. The \nchallenges our people have dealt with have empowered \nand emboldened us further.  \n We will remain unflinchingly democratic. We will \ndefeat those that seek to terrorize us. We will empower \nwomen. We will protect the weak and the vulnerable in \nour midst, especially minorities. We will stand up for \nthe weak and vulnerable abroad. We will support the \nhuman rights of Kashmiris. We will speak in support of \nthe Palestinians. We will educate our children. We will \nprotect our children. We will face any and all \nchallenges with determination and faith. Most of all, \nwe will be a peaceful and prosperous society. There \nwill be challenges, but we will overcome each one of \nthem. \n We do not anticipate undertaking that alone. With \nour neighbours and our friends, we will undertake it \nall, in a spirit of togetherness and of harmony. We will \nforge ahead despite the darkness of our times in the \nspirit that helped to build this great institution. That \nspirit speaks to the very heart of Pakistan\u2019s identity \u2014 \nit is the spirit of the United Nations. Let us join hands \nand march forward, for the good of the peoples of our \ncountries and for the good of the world. \n I will conclude my statement with the words of \nPakistan\u2019s founding father, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad \nAli Jinnah, which is the quintessential expression of \nPakistan\u2019s foreign policy. Mr. Jinnah stated, in a radio \nbroadcast of February 1948:  \n \u201cOur foreign policy is one of friendliness and \ngoodwill towards the nations of the world. We do \nnot cherish aggressive designs against any \ncountry or nation. We believe in the principle of \nhonesty and fair play in national and international \ndealings and are prepared to make our utmost \ncontribution to the promotion of peace and \nprosperity among the nations of the world. \nPakistan will never be found lacking in extending \nits material and moral support to the oppressed \nand suppressed peoples of the world, and in \nupholding the principles of the United Nations \nCharter.\u201d"

        "file_text": "When we \nmet in this very place in September last year, who \namong us could have imagined that in barely one year \nthe world, already shaken by an unprecedented \neconomic crisis, would undergo such change? Within a \nfew months, the Arab Spring gave rise to immense \nhope. \n The Arab peoples, too long crushed by \noppression, were able to raise their heads and claimed \nthe right to be free at last. They fought back against the \nviolence and brutality with their bare hands. To those \nwho proclaimed that the Arab Muslim world was by \nnature hostile to democracy and human rights, the \nyoung Arabs produced the most cogent denial. \n We do not have the right to disappoint the hope of \nthe Arab peoples. We do not have the right to destroy \ntheir dreams. For shattering the dreams of those \npeoples would vindicate the fanatics who have not \nstopped pitting Islam against the West by stirring up \nhatred and violence everywhere. \n That appeal for justice shook the world, and the \nworld cannot respond to that call for justice by \nperpetuating an injustice. That miraculous spring of the \n \n \n23 11-50692 \n \nArab peoples imposes on us the moral and political \nobligation at last to find a solution to the Middle East \nconflict. We cannot wait any longer. The method used \nto date \u2014 I weigh my words carefully \u2014 has failed. So \nwe must change the method. \n We must stop believing that a single country \u2014 \nwhether the largest or a small group of countries \u2014 can \nresolve so complex a problem. Too many large actors \nhave been sidelined for our efforts to succeed. I mean \nthat no one can believe that the peace process can \nsucceed without Europe, without all the permanent \nmembers of the Security Council and without the Arab \nStates that have already chosen peace. A collective \napproach has become indispensable in order to create \ntrust and to provide guarantees to each of the parties. \n Peace will indeed be made by the Israelis and the \nPalestinians, and by no one else. No one can expect to \nimpose it on them. But we must help them.  \n The method no longer works. Let us together \nacknowledge that setting preconditions for negotiation \nis to condemn ourselves to failure. Preconditions are \nthe opposite of negotiation. If we wish to enter into \nnegotiation, which is the only possible path for peace, \nthere must be no preconditions. \n Let us change the method. All the elements of a \nsolution are known \u2014 the Madrid Conference of 1991, \nPresident Obama\u2019s speech of 19 May, the Road Map, \nthe Arab Peace Initiative and the parameters agreed by \nthe European Union. So, let us stop endlessly \ndiscussing the parameters and allow negotiation to \nbegin in line with a concrete and ambitious timetable. \nSixty years without one centimetre\u2019s progress \u2014 does \nthat not compel us to change the method and time \nframe to one month to resume discussions, six months \nto reach agreement on borders and security, and one \nyear to reach a definitive settlement? \n As of this autumn, France proposes hosting a \ndonor conference so that the Palestinians can complete \nthe construction of their future State. France wishes to \nsay that we must not immediately seek the perfect \nsolution, because there are no perfect solutions. Let us \nchoose the path of compromise, which is neither \nrenunciation nor repudiation, but which allows us to \nmove forward, step by step. \n Thus, for 60 years the Palestinians have been \nwaiting for their State. Has the time not come to give \nthem hope? For 60 years, Israel has suffered from not \nbeing able to live in peace. For 60 years, the question \nof the peaceful coexistence of the two peoples \u2014 \nPalestinian and Israeli \u2014 has continued to fester. We \ncan no longer wait to take the path of peace. Let us put \nourselves in the place of the Palestinians. Is it not \nlegitimate that they claim their State? Of course it is. \nAnd who does not see that creating a democratic, \nviable and peaceful Palestinian State would be, for \nIsrael, the best guarantee of its security? \n Let us put ourselves in the place of the Israelis. Is \nit not legitimate that, after 60 years of war and attacks, \nthey demand guarantees of that peace, so long awaited? \nOf course it is. I say that forcefully. If anyone \nanywhere in the world were to threaten the existence of \nIsrael, France would immediately and wholeheartedly \nstand alongside Israel. Threats made against a State \nMember of the United Nations are unacceptable, and \nthey will not be accepted. \n Today, we are facing a very difficult choice. Each \nof us knows \u2014 and let us stop with hypocrisy and one-\noff diplomacy \u2014 that full recognition of the status of a \nState Member of the United Nations cannot be attained \nat once. The first reason for that is the lack of trust \nbetween the main parties. But let us tell the truth: who \ncan doubt that a veto in the Security Council will \nengender a cycle of violence in the Middle East? Who \ncan doubt that? \n Must we therefore exclude an intermediate stage? \nWhy not envisage offering Palestine the status of \nUnited Nations Observer State? That would be an \nimportant step forward. After 60 years of immobility, \nwhich has paved the way for extremists, we would be \ngiving hope to the Palestinians by making progress \ntowards final status. \n To show their determined commitment to a \nnegotiated peace, the Palestinian authorities should, as \npart of that approach, reaffirm Israel\u2019s right to exist \nand to its security. They should commit to avoiding \nusing this new status to resort to actions that are \nincompatible with the pursuit of negotiations. \n We have but one alternative \u2014 immobility and \nnegotiations that go nowhere or an intermediate \nsolution that would give hope to the Palestinians with \nthe status of an Observer State.  \n In parallel, Israel must observe the same restraint. \nIt must abstain from any actions that would prejudge \nthe final status.  \n  \n \n11-50692 24 \n \n The ultimate goal must be mutual recognition of \ntwo nation-States for two peoples established on the \nbasis of the 1967 lines with agreed and equivalent \nexchanges of land.  \n The General Assembly, which has a power to do \nso, should decide to move ahead, leave behind the fatal \ntrap of paralysis, missed appointments and short-lived \nattempts to relaunch the process. Let us change our \napproach. Let us change our state of mind. Each should \ntry to understand the reasoning, sufferings and fears of \nthe other. Each must open its eyes and be ready to \nmake concessions. \n In conclusion, I would like to say to the \nPalestinian people with the deep and sincere friendship \nI hold for them: \u201cThink of the Israeli mothers grieving \nfor their family members killed in terrorist attacks. \nThey feel the same pain as the Palestinian mothers \nconfronted with the brutal death of one of theirs\u201d. \n I would like to say to the Israeli people with the \ndeep and sincere friendship I hold for them: \u201cListen to \nwhat the young people of the Arab Spring are saying: \n\u2018Long live freedom!\u2019 They are not crying \u2018Down with \nIsrael\u2019. You cannot remain immobile when this wind of \nfreedom and democracy is blowing in your region\u201d. \n I say with deep and sincere friendship for these \ntwo peoples who have suffered so much that the time \nhas come to build peace for the children of Palestine \nand for the children of Israel. But it would be a great \nshame if the General Assembly did not seize the \nopportunity of the reawakening of the Arab peoples to \ndemocracy to settle a problem that brings unhappiness \nto these two peoples, who are in any event condemned \nto live alongside each other. If we take a compromise \nsolution, we will rebuild trust and we will give people \nhope. \n I say that with the utmost gravity to the \nrepresentatives of all nations. We must assume an \nhistoric responsibility. It is the General Assembly of \nthe United Nations that must keep this appointment \nwith History. \n Let us reassure Israel and give hope to the \nPalestinian people. The solution is on the table. Let us \ntake this compromise solution over deadlock. Deadlock \nmight satisfy everyone here, but it will create violence, \nbitterness and opposition that will imperil the \nresurgence of the Arab peoples. To that, France says \nthat the tragedy must cease for a simple reason: it has \ngone on for too long. \n"

        "file_text": "We are living in times of \nbreathtaking change. Much of it is good change: \nscientific and technological progress making real \nadvances for humankind, an ever more interconnected \nworld strengthening economic opportunity and \ndevelopmental potential, the profound transformations \nthat are sweeping through North Africa at present. \n But there is also much that is disturbing: violent \nconflict in many parts of the world, growing \nenvironmental damage to our planet, the ravages of a \nglobal financial and economic crisis, the continuing \nscourges of poverty, inequality, human rights abuses, \nterrorism and extremism and a range of other threats to \nglobal peace and security.  \n To respond to these multiple and interrelated \nchallenges, we have one constant anchor: the United \nNations. No other organization is as well equipped to \ndevelop common answers to the big questions of our \ntime. No other organization has the same global impact \nand legitimacy. With our increasing need for global \nsolutions, the United Nations, which represents almost \nall the countries on earth, has the political, moral and \nlegal authority to act. While there may be no easy \nanswers to the questions being posed, our best chance \nof finding effective responses lies in the collective \ndeliberation and action provided for by this \nOrganization. \n Ireland is deeply committed to the United \nNations. We look to it to uphold and defend the \nuniversal values of peace, security, human rights and \ndevelopment that are set out in the United Nations \nCharter. The Charter tells us that all human beings are \nborn free and equal in dignity and rights. The United \nNations is the embodiment of freedom and equality. It \nis a bulwark defending these core human values in a \nchanging and uncertain world.  \n Freedom and equality: these are the values that \nunderpin Ireland\u2019s response to key global and regional \nchallenges. It is our deep commitment to freedom and \nequality that places Ireland in the vanguard of \ninternational efforts to resolve conflict, to create and \nmaintain peace, to eradicate hunger and \nunderdevelopment, and to put an end to human rights \nabuses around the world. \n The values of freedom and equality and the \nessential ideals of the Charter are not just words \nwritten on a page. Since we assembled here 12 months \nago, we have seen them expressed in North Africa and \nthe Middle East in a million acts of courage and \nliberation. We have watched the people of the Arab \nSpring, who have asserted their rights and stood up to \noppression and corruption. Tahrir \u2014 freedom \u2014 has \nnow passed into all our vocabularies as a byword for \nall those no longer prepared to see their basic human \nrights suppressed.  \n The events of the past nine months in North \nAfrica and the Middle East are historic in their sweep \nand profound in their implications. These have been \ngenuinely popular movements demanding reform, \n \n \n25 11-51384 \n \nfreedom and equality. The leadership role exercised \nwithin them by women has been striking and \ninspirational. \n The people of the Arab Spring have stood up and \nstood together to assert their basic rights and freedoms: \nthe right to choose their own leaders, the right not to \nlive in fear of the knock on the door, the right to live \nfreely and openly, the right to provide a decent life and \na hopeful future for themselves and their families. \nThey remind us that the human thirst for basic \nfreedoms is unquenchable, and they should inspire us \nin the work we do here. In rising up to grasp their own \ndestiny, the peoples of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya are \ntracing the path of those others, once in the shadow of \nthe Iron Curtain, who, in demanding those ordinary \nfreedoms, created extraordinary history. \n The United Nations has, of course, played an \nindispensable role in supporting these developments. \nStarting with the key Security Council resolutions 1970 \n(2011) and 1973 (2011), it has led international efforts \nto support the Libyan people. I would like to extend a \nwarm welcome to the representatives of the National \nTransitional Council who took up Libya\u2019s seat at the \nUnited Nations this week, and I pledge Ireland\u2019s full \nsupport as they seek to rebuild Libya and to fulfil the \ndemocratic aspirations of the Libyan people.  \n We cannot know the final outcome of the events \nwe are witnessing. We must ensure that the democratic \nchanges under way are consolidated and that the \npromise of profound improvements in human rights in \nthe countries concerned, in particular in relation to the \nrole of women, is fully realized. \n However, the situation in Syria continues to \narouse the deepest international concern. President \nAl-Assad and his Government seem oblivious to the \ndemands of the Syrian people for change and to the \nlessons of the Arab Spring elsewhere. They appear \ndetermined to respond with further oppression and \nviolence. Our basic message to the Syrian leader is \nthis: no leader who refuses to listen to what his people \nare saying and to act on their clearly expressed desire \nfor peace and reform can expect to remain in power. \n In the Middle East peace process, the search for \nfreedom and equality has yet to bear fruit. The Arab-\nIsraeli conflict remains depressingly deadlocked. \nUnless this deadlock is broken, the opportunities for \nyet another generation of children will be destroyed.  \n The situation in the Middle East is urgent. After \n20 years of failed initiatives, disillusionment about the \nability of the political process to deliver a settlement is \ndeepening. Young Palestinians in particular are \nfrustrated and despairing. The position of the moderate \nPalestinian leadership is under threat. Never has it been \nmore important to show that politics works and that a \npeaceful, just and lasting settlement is within reach \nthrough negotiation. \n Everybody knows what a final and \ncomprehensive settlement would involve: two States, \nbased on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed land \nswaps, living side by side in peace and security. It is \nmore pressing than ever to launch direct negotiations \nthat would address all the core issues and culminate in \nsuch an agreement within a specified time frame.  \n Ireland has long been an advocate of the \nestablishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian \nState within borders based on those of 1967. We want \nto see the peoples of Palestine and Israel living as good \nneighbours in peace, security and prosperity as soon as \npossible \u2014 and this can come about only through \nnegotiation. Ireland strongly opposes all action that \nserves to hinder or delay negotiations, such as violent \nattacks on civilians and their property or Israel\u2019s illegal \nsettlement of occupied Palestinian territory.  \n The decision of President Abbas to seek \nmembership in the United Nations for Palestine is \nentirely legitimate and understandable. Palestine has \nthe same right to membership in the United Nations as \nIreland or any other Member of this Organization. \nSome would seek to argue that Palestine cannot be \nrecognized as a State because its borders remain to be \nagreed on. But if the borders of Palestine are still a \nmatter for negotiation, then so, by definition, are those \nof Israel, which is rightly a full Member of the United \nNations. \n Membership in the United Nations of itself, \nhowever, would not change the unstable and \nunacceptable situation on the ground. It does not \nremove the compelling need for negotiations. Nor will \nit offer a legitimate excuse to avoid negotiations. \nWhatever happens here at the United Nations, \nnegotiations must resume as soon as possible. The \nstatement issued last Friday by the Quartet provides a \nframework for precisely that. \n What recognition of Palestinian statehood would \ndo, however, is to give dignity and support to the \n  \n \n11-51384 26 \n \nPalestinian people, who have suffered for too long. It \nwould also be a tangible demonstration of the \ncommitment of the international community and the \nUnited Nations to an agreed settlement between two \nsovereign States, living side by side in peace, security \nand prosperity. \n The day will come, not too far off, when the \nGeneral Assembly will be asked to vote on a proposal \nto admit Palestine as a Member of the Organization, or \nperhaps, as an interim step towards the achievement of \nthat goal, to accord Palestine non-member observer \nState status. Provided that the resolution is drafted in \nterms that are reasonable and balanced, I expect Ireland \nto give its full support. In Ireland, we know from our \nown experience that peace does not come easily. It \nrequires political will and difficult compromises. But \nwe also know the benefits of peace. There can be no \ndoubting the hugely transformative power for the \nMiddle East region of a final end to the Arab-Israeli \nconflict. \n The international community has invested far too \nmuch effort and resources over the past decades not to \ndo all it can now to assist a return to direct talks by the \ntwo sides. In the words of Martin Luther King, we \ncannot ignore the fierce urgency of now. \n I again urge the Government of Israel to halt all \nsettlement expansion. I also call on it to end the unjust \nblockade of Gaza by opening up land crossings to \nnormal commercial, human and humanitarian traffic. \n The search for freedom and equality drives the \nenormously important work being done by the United \nNations and by its individual Member States in the area \nof development. \n The Millennium Development Goals provide the \nessential framework for international development \nefforts up to 2015. As we look beyond 2015, the United \nNations must remain central to the fight to end poverty \nand hunger in the world. \n A century and a half ago, the streets around this \nbuilding where we now meet, and throughout this great \ncity, were thronged with tens of thousands of Irish \npeople who came here as refugees from famine. To this \nvery day, the memory of that time remains with the \nIrish people. \n Hunger remains humankind\u2019s greatest enemy. As \nwe meet today in New York, some 12 million people \nare struggling to find food to keep their families alive \nin the Horn of Africa. Seven hundred and fifty-\nthousand are at imminent risk of death from hunger. \nThe immediate cause of this crisis is drought, but its \nseverity is the result of a combination of factors, \nincluding conflict, insecurity and persistent \nunderdevelopment. We have a moral obligation to act \nin the face of such suffering.  \n Ireland is providing over $67 million to the Horn \nof Africa in 2011 and 2012, in direct life saving \nhumanitarian assistance and through measures to \nenhance food security. The clear lesson of previous \nhumanitarian emergencies in Africa is that we must \naddress the causes in order to prevent future crises. The \nneed to address the systemic global hunger crisis is, \nand will remain, central to Ireland\u2019s development \nassistance programme. Our objective is to save lives \ntoday and build new futures for communities ravaged \nby hunger. The Scaling Up Nutrition movement, \nlaunched at the United Nations a year ago, makes a \nclear link between under-nutrition among mothers and \nbabies and the building of a healthy, educated and \nprosperous society in the future. \n We need to act together now to provide long-term \nsustainable solutions that will decisively break the \ncycle of food shortages. We believe that a strong focus \nis essential on building the productivity of smallholder \nfarmers in sub-Saharan Africa, 80 per cent of whom are \nwomen and the primary care givers of children and \nproviders of food, fuel and water. \n We know that climate change is \ndisproportionately affecting their lives and their \nlivelihoods. Their farms and livestock are less \nproductive. Their coping mechanisms are less \neffective. Over time, they are vulnerable to abject \npoverty and despair. I believe that there is a compelling \ncase for \u201cclimate justice\u201d, namely, bringing \ndevelopmental fairness to bear on the climate change \nagenda. \n The global financial and economic crisis presents \nmajor challenges for all of us in our efforts to maintain \nsolidarity with developing countries. Aid budgets are \nunder significant pressure. But we will not turn our \nbacks on the world\u2019s poorest. In Ireland, despite the \neconomic difficulties that we are facing, and because \nwe recognize our moral obligation and our interests, \nvalues and principles as a member of the international \ncommunity, development will remain at the heart of \nour foreign policy. We remain committed to the United \n \n \n27 11-51384 \n \nNations target of providing 0.7 per cent of gross \nnational income to Official Development Assistance \n(ODA). We will continue to work to achieve that \ntarget. \n As Ireland will sustain its ODA effort, we will \nalso maintain our longstanding engagement across \ncritical areas of United Nations work. We remain \nstrongly supportive of the vital role of the United \nNations in peacekeeping and conflict resolution. \nRecently a 440-strong battalion of peacekeepers from \nthe Irish Defence Forces returned to serve with the \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, the first \ncountry to which we deployed peacekeepers more than \nhalf a century ago. \n A deep attachment to the values of freedom and \nequality and other core human rights principles \nunderpins our candidature for election to the Human \nRights Council at the elections to be held in 2012. If \nelected, we look forward to making a strong \ncontribution to the work of enhancing the Council\u2019s \nperformance and promoting respect for human rights \nworldwide. \n We will continue to push for the disarmament \nmachinery of the United Nations to become more \nresponsive to twenty-first century imperatives. Key \nchallenges for the year ahead include the \nimplementation of the agreements reached at last \nyear\u2019s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, as \nwell as the negotiation of a robust arms trade treaty. \nWe will maintain a strong focus on the implementation \nand universalization of the Convention on Cluster \nMunitions, adopted in Dublin three years ago. \n Regional organizations have always been vital \npartners for the United Nations in the areas of peace, \nsecurity and conflict resolution. Next year, Ireland will \nchair the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (OSCE). We look forward to making our \ncontribution to the resolution of the so-called \nprotracted conflicts within the OSCE region. Our \nchairmanship will be a practical demonstration of \nIreland\u2019s strong commitment to multilateralism and \nwill draw on our own national experience of conflict \nresolution. \n Over the past week, the Assembly has heard of a \nformidable array of challenges facing the world. Peace \nand security, human rights, the elimination of hunger: \nthese are among the great moral imperatives of our \ntime. Underlying each of them is the need to assert the \nfreedom and equality of all human beings. Now more \nthan ever, the United Nations is demonstrating that it is \nthe home for these fundamental values and goals and \nthe arena in which we can best pursue collective \nsolutions. \n Ireland will play its full part in the search for \nthose solutions. Whether it is to bring peace to parts of \nthe world ravaged by conflict, relief to those threatened \nby famine and starvation or protection to those \nafflicted by human rights abuses, we will make our \ncontribution. We will stand up, in the Assembly and \nelsewhere, for fairness, for justice, for freedom and for \nequality, in the conduct of international relations."

        "file_text": "The primary \npurpose of the United Nations is to maintain peace and \nsecurity, as set out in the very first Article of its \nCharter. This remains the top priority of the \ninternational community and of the United Nations. \n However, 66 years after the adoption of the \nCharter, our definition of peace and security differs \nfrom what it was in the immediate aftermath of the \nSecond World War. Our concerns today are wider than \nthe mere suppression of aggression or similar breaches \nof peace. We are now equally concerned about the \nthreats to peace and security resulting from factors \nother than armed aggression. Tensions exist, within \nnations and among nations, as a result of unequal \naccess to resources, the lack of food security, or \nexistential threats because of the inability to address \nclimate change issues. Insecurity also results from the \nabsence of an adequate international mechanism for the \nredress of grievances and the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes. \n I propose to deal with four of the constitutive \nelements of present-day security that the international \ncommunity and the United Nations should address, \n  \n \n11-51360 24 \n \nnamely, the elements of economic, environmental, \nhuman and legal security. \n When peoples and nations feel inextricably mired \nin poverty and face bleak prospects for development, \nthey are insecure about their future. That economic \ninsecurity may ultimately threaten global peace. The \ncurrent economic turmoil is deepening the despair of \nthose who live in need and is spreading despondency, \neven in relatively affluent countries. The world \neconomy has yet to recover from the crisis of 2008. \n Today, Europe and North America struggle with \nbudget deficits, unsustainable debts and high \nunemployment. At the same time, the recent political \nturmoil across the Middle East could mean that oil and \nfood prices will continue to rise. As developed \neconomies grapple with these serious challenges, the \ndeveloping world finds itself negatively impacted by \neconomic and financial crises resulting from failures in \nwhich it had absolutely no part. \n While the ability of established developed \ncountries to deal with economic and financial problems \nis in question, the world is witnessing the rapid rise of \na number of emerging economies. As the economic \ncentre of gravity shifts eastward and creates new \nopportunities, we must ensure that those formidable \nglobal challenges do not create economic insecurity for \nthose who feel left behind and that they do not lead to \nother threats to international security. \n It is imperative that we manage these \ntransformations judiciously and with pragmatism. In \nthat context, I must stress the particular economic \nvulnerabilities of small island developing States \n(SIDS). The economies of SIDS remain highly volatile \nbecause of their open economies, small economic size, \nnarrow resource base, disadvantages in economies of \nscale, high export concentration, dependency on \nimports and high vulnerability to energy- and food-\nprice shocks. \n We reiterate that SIDS need to be granted \npreferential treatment as part of a global strategy to \nensure economic security. Regrettably, SIDS have been \ndenied the formal recognition of their specific \nvulnerabilities that would entitle them to special \nconsideration. My delegation fully supports the \nimplementation of the Barbados Plan of Action and the \nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. \n As there are increasing concerns over issues such \nas employment, food security, climate change and \naccess to water, it is a matter of regret that trade talks \nthat could give a boost to international trade, and \ntherefore to economic security, are stalled. \n On a broader note, I must say that talks on trade \nand other economic issues, to the extent that they take \nplace at all, are held in sectoral and often restricted \nforums. While the specialized nature of these \nnegotiations, or of the scope of the matters being \naddressed by standard-setting organizations, may \nrequire dedicated sectoral frameworks, it is imperative \nthat the international community ensures that those \nframeworks are legitimate ones, with universal \nmembership. It is also imperative that, as an apex body, \nthe United Nations have a holistic view on global \neconomic, financial, trade and development issues. \n During the 1970s, the United Nations played a \nsignificant role in shaping the conceptual framework \nfor a new international economic order. The United \nNations has adopted a number of landmark resolutions \nthat have laid the normative foundation for a more \nequitable economic order. The United Nations still has \na role to play in shaping the world economic order to \nensure economic security, in accordance with its \nmandate under the Charter. The United Nations is the \nonly international organization with not just the \nnecessary legitimacy and universality but also the \nresponsibility to have an overview of global economic \ndevelopment. In doing so, the United Nations will \nensure policy coordination among forums for various \nsectors, set principles and guidelines for sector-specific \nnegotiations, and assume its ultimate responsibility for \nthe economic security of all nations. \n To reaffirm its responsibility with respect to \neconomic security, the United Nations must not only \nundergo reforms in its institutions and working \nmethods, it must also re-balance its focus on political \nand economic issues. In this regard, the Economic and \nSocial Council must be given the prominence it was \nintended to have as one of the principal organs of the \nUnited Nations. And in assuming its responsibility with \nrespect to economic security, a reformed and \nrevitalized United Nations will have to work more \nclosely with regional cooperative institutions, which \nare the pillars of international cooperation. \n The high food prices of 2007 and 2008 and the \nglobal economic crisis led millions of people into food \n \n \n25 11-51360 \n \ninsecurity and raised the total number of people who \ngo hungry to more than 1 billion. Commodity prices \nremain high and the risk of repeated crises is real. With \nthe projected increase in world population to \n9.1 billion by 2050, and the rising costs of production, \nthere is a risk of persistent price volatility. That will be \nexacerbated by the effects of climate change. The \ninternational community must therefore seriously \naddress the issue of food insecurity around the world.  \n Economic security also entails working towards a \nmore inclusive national society without discrimination, \neliminating inequalities and fostering wider \nparticipation on the part of all sections of the \ncommunity in national development and governance. \n Two days ago, at our 14th meeting, we gathered \nto commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption \nof the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. \nWe welcome the progress achieved in the fight against \nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \nintolerance since 2001. We nonetheless recognize that \nin spite of these efforts, many people continue to be \nvictims of these despicable practices. \n We commend the United Nations on the success \nof the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on \nYouth (see A/65/PVs.111 and 112) and the adoption of \nthe outcome document (resolution 65/312). \nDevelopment and security will require greater \nparticipation by young people in the formulation of \nstrategies and policies.  \n In that same spirit, we welcome the establishment \nof UN-Women and its overarching vision of a world in \nwhich societies are free of gender-based discrimination \nand where women and men have equal opportunities, \nrespect and consideration. A more inclusive world, \nwhere women\u2019s intellectual and economic potential is \nfully realized, will promote economic security. \n In June of next year, world leaders will meet in \nRio de Janeiro to renew their political commitment to \nsustainable development and, hopefully, to adopt \nconcrete measures that will contribute to greater \neconomic security. But before we can move ahead, we \nwill also have to consider why so many past \ncommitments have not been honoured. We look \nforward to the oceans receiving the attention that they \ndeserve at Rio, as part of the broader economic agenda. \nSmall island States in particular are relying on the \ninternational community to give due attention to the \nsustainability of the oceans in the context of the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \n(Rio+20) and beyond. The sustainability of oceans is \ncrucial to the security and, in some cases, the very \nsurvival of many small island States. \n Humanity as a whole is now increasingly \nconcerned about its environmental security, probably \nmore than it has ever been in its history. For some \nsmall island nations, this concern is, in fact, an \nexistential one. In recent decades the United Nations \nhas brought to the fore the concept of sustainable \ndevelopment and the measures required to promote \nsuch development. The preparatory work under way for \nRio+20 has highlighted the serious gaps we still face in \nthis area. The disruptions resulting from climate \nchange pose a real threat to global security. \n Climate change is real. Extreme weather \nphenomena such as super-storms, floods, droughts and \nheat-waves are already upon us. Climate change is \naffecting us in our daily life, and it threatens the very \nsurvival of many small islands. Mauritius is already \nexperiencing the adverse effects of climate change. Air \ntemperature has risen by 0.6\u00b0 to 1.1\u00b0C in different \nmicroclimates over recent decades. The sea level is \nrising at the rate of 1.2 millimetres per year in the \nsouth-west Indian Ocean. Our annual rainfall has \ndecreased by 8 per cent compared to the 1950s. \nExtreme weather conditions such as flooding are \nbecoming more frequent. \n Without international cooperation and concerted \naction, the impact of climate change will be \ndevastating for all our nations. My delegation firmly \nbelieves that the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change is the primary \ninternational, intergovernmental forum for negotiating \nthe global response to climate change. Small island \nnations are economically vulnerable, and their \nvulnerability is exacerbated by the dramatic \nconsequences of climate change. Small island States \nrely on the international community for their security. \n Mauritius is committed to the concept of the \ngreen economy. We recognize that it is not a one-size-\nfits-all notion. Countries need to reflect their own \nnational priorities and realities in their implementation \nof it.  \n My Government has been pursuing a sustainable \ndevelopment strategy. The Maurice Ile Durable project, \nwhich we adopted in 2008, is taking shape, and a \nwhole range of measures have already been \n  \n \n11-51360 26 \n \nimplemented. We propose to increase the share of \nrenewable energy in the generation of power from the \npresent 18 per cent to 35 per cent by 2025, by making \nmore intensive use of biofuels and wave, solar and \nwind energy. To that end in May last year I set up a \nfull-fledged ministry with responsibility for sustainable \ndevelopment. We are engaged in a national \nconsultation process to formulate strategies and \npolicies that have public support and are designed to \nprotect the environment, deliver social justice and \ncreate a sustainable economy. \n Climate has impacted the water cycle both \ndirectly and indirectly, and will continue to do so, by \naffecting precipitation and evaporation cycles as well \nas water availability and patterns of water \nconsumption. Many regions of the world are already \nexperiencing reduced rainfall. As climate change \nintensifies and water scarcity becomes more acute, the \nthreat of tensions among different nations and different \nusers may increase. The international community must \ntherefore work together to address this pressing issue. \nEnvironmental security must be a priority of the United \nNations in promoting global security. \n As well as dealing with the existential threat that \nclimate change poses for some nations, people around \nthe world continue to be concerned about their own \nsecurity. I will mention four such concerns.  \n Disarmament is a major component of \ninternational security strategy. The threat to humanity \nposed by the continued existence of nuclear and other \nweapons of mass destruction is a universal concern. \nOur failure to resolve the issue of disarmament \ncontinues to undermine global development and \nsecurity. A significant reduction in the production of \nconventional weapons and eventually a world free of \nnuclear weapons are goals that will be achieved only \nover time, and that will require patience and \nperseverance. As a matter of fact, the international \npolitical environment is now probably more conducive \nto the realization of these goals than it has ever been. \n Terrorism continues to be a threat to security. \nRecent events have reminded us that acts of terrorism \ncan be perpetrated by extremists from all points on the \npolitical spectrum, and that terrorism is equally capable \nof breeding in both poor and rich countries. The \ninternational community needs to follow up on the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and \nenhance international cooperation in that regard. \n The World Drug Report 2011 again shows that \ndrug trafficking and consumption remain significant. \nNarco-trafficking and drug money in organized crime \nand terrorist activities are a threat to stability and \nsecurity at the national and regional levels. As we \ncelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the 1961 Single \nConvention on Narcotic Drugs, let us recommit our \nefforts to fight drug trafficking as part of the global \nstrategy to ensure human security. \n We are 30 years into the fight against HIV/AIDS, \nwhich is an ever-present threat to human security. I am \nconvinced that we have achieved more in the 10 years \nsince the special session of the General Assembly on \nHIV/AIDS than we did in the previous two decades. It \nis heartening that the High-level Meeting on \nHIV/AIDS held in June renewed the political \ncommitment of Governments to halting and reversing \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS and to ensuring that, by 2015, \nno child is born with HIV (see resolution 65/277, \nannex). \n Mauritius fully adheres to the UNAIDS vision of \nuniting for universal access. The National AIDS \nSecretariat, which I set up in May 2007, pursues its \nwork to achieve zero new infections, zero \ndiscrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths in \nMauritius. \n Article 2 of the United Nations Charter provides \nthat all Members shall settle their disputes by peaceful \nmeans. Article 33 spells out the means and ways of \ndoing so. In the same spirit, the Charter provides in \nChapter XIV for the establishment of the International \nCourt of Justice. \n However, recourse to international adjudication \nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes between States \nhas, historically, required the consent of the States \nconcerned. In recent times, a number of bilateral or \nmultilateral agreements have provided for the prior \ncommitment of States to submit to arbitration or \nadjudication. We welcome that development. \n Security requires the appropriate legal framework \nfor the redress of grievances or the settlement of \ndisputes. The international community has yet to set up \nadequate machinery for the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes that is available to all States. \n The General Assembly has decided to convene a \nhigh-level meeting during the sixty-seventh session on \nthe rule of law. We welcome that decision, but we want \n \n \n27 11-51360 \n \nto stress that the debate on the rule of law must apply \nat both the national and international level. We would \ntherefore look forward to the Assembly discussing the \nrule of law as it applies to inter-State relations as part \nof the forthcoming debates. \n Allow me to give as an example the difficulties \nthat my own country has experienced in resolving a \ndispute with the former colonial Power, the United \nKingdom, relating to decolonization. The Chagos \nArchipelago, which is part of Mauritian territory, was \nexcised from Mauritius prior to independence, in total \ndisregard of resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2066 (XX) and \nthe principles of international law, and was declared \nthe so-called British Indian Ocean Territory. The \nUnited Kingdom has failed to engage in any \nmeaningful discussions with us on the matter. \n When the Government of Mauritius consequently \nannounced in 2004 that it would refer the dispute to the \nInternational Court of Justice, the United Kingdom \nimmediately amended its declaration, under Article 36 \nof the Court\u2019s Statute, to reject the jurisdiction of the \nCourt with respect to certain disputes with a member or \nformer member of the Commonwealth. That illustrates \nthe kind of difficulties that a State may face in settling \na claim under international law. The States involved in \nthe dispute may refuse to negotiate in good faith and \nseek to ensure that no international tribunal can \ndetermine the law applicable to the dispute.  \n We call on the United Nations to keep under \nreview the whole issue of the settlement of disputes, \nincluding by judicial means, and to set standards of \nconduct for all States with respect to negotiation, \nconciliation, mediation or other forms of non-judicial \nand peaceful settlement of disputes or, alternatively, to \nthe submission of the dispute to adjudication. \n In that context, Mauritius is particularly pleased \nto welcome the decision of the President of the General \nAssembly to adopt as the theme of its current session \nthe role of mediation in settling international disputes. \nWe affirm our full support in advancing that cause. \n Greater legal security also requires better global \ngovernance. In that respect, the United Nations must \nlead by example. The United Nations must recognize \nthat the world has changed since 1945. Current efforts \nto adopt reforms in relation to the Security Council, the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the working \nmethods of our Organization must be given the sincere \nand strong support that is required. \n My delegation continues to believe that \ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council should \ninclude reform in the membership of both the \npermanent and the non-permanent categories. Africa \nshould no longer be deprived of its right to permanent \nrepresentation on the Council. My delegation fully \nsupports the African common position enshrined in the \nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. \n We equally believe that Latin America also fully \ndeserves permanent representation on the Council. \nMauritius further reiterates its support for India\u2019s \nrightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed \nSecurity Council. \n We also look forward to a more all-inclusive \nUnited Nations system that can effectively address \nissues of international security, with the admission of \nPalestine as a Member State. The United Nations and \nthe international community have a duty to restore to \nthe Palestinian people their dignity and their right to \nstatehood and security. Mauritius supports the \napplication for full membership of the United Nations, \nsubmitted to the Secretary-General yesterday by the \nPresident of the State of Palestine (A/66/371, annex), \nand the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people \nto take their rightful place in the international \ncommunity. We welcome the statement by President \nAbbas at the 19th meeting that Palestine extends its \nhands to the Israeli Government and the Israeli people \nfor peacemaking and for building cooperative relations \nbetween the States of Palestine and Israel. \n We are also pleased to welcome the emergence of \nSouth Sudan as an independent and a sovereign State \nand its admission to the United Nations. \n Before I conclude, I wish to say a few words \nabout matters of interest to our region. \n As a coastal State of the Indian Ocean, Mauritius \nis concerned by piracy, which poses a threat to global \ncommerce. It hinders economic development and has \nbecome a major security issue in the region and \nbeyond. We welcome the response of the international \ncommunity to that serious threat. Cognizant of the \nproblems that arise in connection with the prosecution \nand detention of pirates, Mauritius has offered to assist \nwith the prosecution and detention of pirates. Mauritius \nand the European Union signed an agreement in July \nthis year to enhance our capacity to contribute to the \ninternational effort under way in that regard. \n  \n \n11-51360 28 \n \n If the international response to the famine in \nSomalia is not commensurate with the immense and \nimmediate needs of the people, we fear that the \nproblem of piracy will only worsen. \n The continued unlawful occupation of the Chagos \nArchipelago by the United Kingdom is a matter of \nconcern for the region. Mauritius welcomes the support \nof the African Union and of the Non-Aligned \nMovement for the territorial integrity of our country. \nThe purported declaration of a marine protected area \naround the Chagos Archipelago by the United \nKingdom, in breach of the United Nations Convention \non the Law of the Sea, is another cause for concern. \nThat is why, in December of last year, Mauritius \ncommenced arbitration proceedings against the United \nKingdom under the 1982 Convention on the Law of the \nSea. \n As regards Tromelin, Mauritius and France made \nprogress with an agreement on joint management, \nwithout prejudice to our sovereignty. However, we \nneed to continue our dialogue for at the end of the day, \nthe territorial integrity of Mauritius will not be \ncomplete without the return of Tromelin. \n As a member of the Southern African \nDevelopment Community (SADC) and current Chair of \nthe Indian Ocean Commission, Mauritius welcomes the \nsigning last week of an agreement between leading \nstakeholders on a road map for the restoration of \ndemocracy in our neighbouring State of Madagascar. \nThat agreement was reached following the relentless \nefforts of SADC and the Indian Ocean Commission to \nbring the parties together. Implementation of the road \nmap requires the holding of national and local \nelections, for which significant resources need to be \nmobilized. We call on the United Nations and the \ninternational community to extend all their support for \nthe successful implementation of the road map. \n(spoke in French) \n The lack of security on the economic, \nenvironmental, legal or even, in some cases, existential \nfronts calls for a review of the mandated obligations of \nthe United Nations. While the initial concerns of the \nfounding fathers about threats to international security \nremain valid, the international community today is just \nas concerned by other threats to its security and other \nchallenges to be tackled. \n I would add that, in updating this concept of \nsecurity and, by extension, in redefining the role of the \nUnited Nations, the international community must also \nfoster dialogue among cultures and civilizations. We \nwelcome the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to create the \nAlliance of Civilizations, whose mission is to improve \nunderstanding and relations among nations and peoples \nof different cultures and religions and to assist efforts \nto halt the forces that fuel divisions and extremism.  \n Tensions are often caused by ignorance, by fear \nof others and by feelings of justice denied. Thus it is \ncrucial not only to maintain dialogue among nations \nand peoples, but also to promote the understanding of \ncultures and civilizations."

        "file_text": "\u201cThey shall beat their swords into ploughshares, \nand their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall \nnot lift up sword against nation, neither shall they \nlearn war any more.\u201d (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4) \n Far from achieving Isaiah\u2019s prophecy, humankind \ncontinues to face serious challenges at this time when \nHis Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss has passed the baton \nto the new President after presiding brilliantly over the \nGeneral Assembly at its previous session. I have no \ndoubt that on his election to the presidency of the \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session, the President brings \nto it great strengths, bolstered in particular with the \nunderstanding and mastery of international realities he \nhas acquired as, among other positions, Permanent \nRepresentative of his country, and having sat on the \nSecurity Council during Qatar\u2019s non-permanent \nmembership. \n The President did well in choosing as the theme \nfor his term \u201cThe role of mediation in the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes\u201d. Under the guidance of \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, sustained efforts have \nbeen made in this area. Here I would like to pay tribute \n \n \n17 11-51191 \n \nto him for the work he has done during his first term \nand to congratulate him on his re-election on 21 June \nas head of the Organization. I would also like once \nagain to thank him for the Organization\u2019s unfailing \nsupport during the multiple crises that my country, \nNiger, has undergone in recent years. More generally, \nwe have seen his commitment to the concerns of the \nAfrican continent and hope that his new term will \nenable him to continue on the same path. \n The choice of theme for the current session is \nproof that the prophecy of Isaiah, whose verse is \nrightly engraved in front of the United Nations \nbuilding, has been slow to become reality. Indeed, the \ninternational situation has been and continues to be \ncharacterized by serious tensions. We might have \nthought that the end of the cold war would open the \nway to an age of full and lasting peace around the \nworld. Unfortunately, owing to a lack of the ability or \nperhaps even the will to attack the evil at the root, our \nhope for a world free of conflict, like the line of the \nhorizon, recedes as we approach it. \n The root of the evil is bad political and economic \ngovernance. The promises of freedom, equality, justice, \nthe rule of law and solidarity that have been made to \nthe people of the world at the global and the national \nlevels have not always been kept. The absence of \nglobal economic regulation, the domination of \nfinancial capital over even the real economy, the \ngrowth of inequalities between and within nations are \njust so many factors in the chaos, crises and conflicts \nthat are disturbing peace around the world. Besides, \ncan a world where several billion people live in \npoverty be peaceful? What do the billion human beings \nwho are hungry have to lose? Can the Somalis, who are \nsuffering the tortures of hunger right now, or the \ninhabitants of the Sahel, who deal with hunger over \nand over again, believe that they live in a just, humane \nworld? Can extreme poverty coexist peacefully with \nextreme wealth? \n Today, 1,210 people, that is, 17 per 100 million of \nthe world\u2019s population, control revenues of \n$4,500 billion \u2014 8 per cent of the world\u2019s aggregate \ngross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 while the income of \n20 per cent of the poorest represents only 1.5 per cent, \nand that of the 2.5 billion people who live on less than \n$2 a day \u2014 40 per cent of the total population \u2014 \nrepresents only 5 per cent. Thus a thousand or so \npeople have an income one and a half times larger than \nall the 2.5 billion people living on less than $2 a day. \nBesides being morally shocking, this situation is \neconomically inefficient, since it strangles economic \ngrowth. Furthermore, the implementation of structural \nadjustment programmes that began in the 1980s is a \nperfect illustration of bad global economic governance. \nThe liberalization and privatization touted by such \nprogrammes were conducted anarchically; even today, \nsuch liberalization has been applied only in sectors \nwhere weak countries such as ours have no relative \nadvantages. As we know, such liberalization did not \naffect the markets for labour or agricultural products. \nMy country, Niger, has suffered greatly from such \npolicies. \n This is, finally, where we should recall that the \npromise made by the world\u2019s wealthy nations, \nbeginning in the 1970s, to increase their public \ndevelopment aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP has still not \nbeen kept. If you add to that the recent crises in \nbanking and sovereign debt, along with the shortfall in \ndirect investment in Africa, where there is nonetheless \ngreat scope for economic growth, you can understand \nthe inadequacy of global economic growth, particularly \nthe collapse of economic growth in wealthy countries. \nThe economic elasticity and resilience we need to cope \nwith the crises will grow only with the development of \nthe countries of the South. The world\u2019s equilibrium \ndepends on the balanced development of all its regions; \nin particular, the creation of a powerful middle class in \nevery region of the world will strengthen economic \ngrowth, stability and peace. \n For more than 60 years, the Middle East has been \none of the most turbulent regions on the planet. We had \ngreat hopes for the resumption on 9 May 2010 of \nindirect negotiations between the Israelis and \nPalestinians, mediated by the United Nations. The start \nof direct bilateral negotiations represented real hope \nfor reaching a global peace agreement based on a two-\nState solution, with an independent and viable \nPalestinian State living side by side in peace and \nsecurity with Israel and its neighbours. \n It is undoubtedly the failure of those talks that \nhas led the Palestinian Authority to take steps to \nachieve recognition of the State of Palestine based, on \nthe one hand, on the 1967 borders, and on the other, on \nits admission as a full Member of the United Nations. \nThis is the moment for our Organization to take a bold \ndecision designed to settle the Israel-Palestinian \nproblem definitively, a settlement without which the \nArab Spring will be unable to guarantee peace and \n  \n \n11-51191 18 \n \nsecurity in the entire Middle East. Indeed, the failure of \ndemocracies to resolve this long-standing crisis will \ninevitably reinforce terrorism and will erase the \ndemocratic achievements of the Spring.  \n My country, Niger, one of the 122 Member States \nthat have already recognized the State of Palestine, is \nsupporting its request for full membership in the \nUnited Nations, as presented this morning at this sixty-\nsixth session of the General Assembly. \n The tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks \nagainst the United States, commemorated last \n11 September, and the recent suicide attack against the \nUnited Nations headquarters in Abuja in Nigeria prove \nthat no region of the world is safe from terrorism. We \nfirmly condemn all acts of terrorism, wherever, for \nwhatever reason and by whomever they are committed, \nas they present one of the most serious threats to peace \nand security.  \n Terrorism, as the Assembly knows, attacks the \nvalues that constitute the essence of the United Nations \nCharter: respect for human rights, the rule of law, the \nrules governing war and the protection of civilians, \ntolerance among peoples and nations and the peaceful \nresolution of disputes.  \n In Niger, we face this threat on our northern \nborder with Algeria, to the west with Mali and to the \nsouth with Nigeria. I would like to pay a well-deserved \ntribute to the Nigerian security and defence forces, \nsome of whom have given their lives in their \ncommitment to protecting our country from terrorism.  \n Along with that threat, of course, we also have to \nface criminal organizations that traffic in weapons, \ndrugs and human beings. All of these threats have been \nexacerbated by the Libyan crisis. Indeed, arms depots \nhave been pillaged in Libya. Those weapons are now \ndistributed throughout the Sahara and Sahel area and \nrisk ending up in the hands of terrorists. Given the \nregional nature of the threats, Niger is determined to \nwork jointly with other countries, especially in our \nsubregion, to deal with the situation. The risk to the \nstability of the entire subregion, where some countries \nexperience recurrent rebellions, should not be \nunderestimated.  \n We hope that there will be a rapid solution to the \ncrisis, which would not just have a security impact on \nNiger, but also an economic and social impact, given \nthe work stoppage on the road construction that was \nbeing financed by Libya, the return from Libya of over \n210,000 migrant Niger nationals and the arrival of \nincreasing numbers of Libyan refugees fleeing the war. \nNiger is a democratic country, governed by the rule of \nlaw, and we will treat these refugees in compliance \nwith our laws and international law. Until now, our \ncountry, with very limited means, has been bearing this \nterrible burden alone. Our country therefore requires \nsupport and help from the international community in \nterms of both the security and the economic issues, as \nwe are on the frontlines of the war against terrorism.  \n Niger would also like to see a rapid return to \npeace and stability in this brotherly country and \nreconciliation among Libyans. We are concerned by the \nsituation, because the democratic institutions that our \ncountries are trying to build are still fragile. We are \nconcerned because the reality of widespread poverty \nprovides a breeding ground for terrorism.  \n My country, Niger, believes that, apart from \nimmediate security solutions, the strengthening of \ndemocratic institutions and economic and social \ndevelopment are the only ways to confine terrorism \nand guarantee peace. Democratic values are universal. \nIt has been decisively proven: there is no such thing as \nclimate determinism, which would condemn hot \ncountries to despotism and temperate countries to \ndemocracy. In understanding this, the world has made a \nquantum leap, convincing even those who would \nbelieve that the fight for democracy is simply a new \nversion of the mission to civilize, which was the \njustification for the colonialism of the past century \nbrought about by the alliance of the sword and the \ncenser.  \n As a Muslim, I would like to say that terrorism \nhas nothing to do with Islam. Islam has always \nemphasized fraternity and justice. It has always \nemphasized the intrinsic unity of all human beings and \ntheir equality, whatever their origins. Islam therefore \nproclaims that all men are equal like the teeth of a \ncomb in the hands of a weaver. Islam is a religion of \ntolerance.  \n  \u201cI do not serve that which you serve, nor do \nyou serve Him Whom I serve: nor am I going to \nserve that which you serve, nor are you going to \nserve Him Whom I serve: you shall have your \nreligion and I shall have my religion.\u201d (The Holy \nKoran, CIX: 2-6) \n \n \n19 11-51191 \n \n Those are the divine words, full of tolerance, \nfrom a sura of the Koran. Thus, terrorism has nothing \nto do with Islam, with real Islam, which is a religion of \nthe happy medium, and the fight against terrorism \nshould not be considered a religious conflict, a clash \nbetween two civilizations, a struggle between Judeo-\nChristian civilization and Muslim civilization, or a \nfight to the death between the Christian West and the \nMuslim East. The world must not return to the \nreligious wars of the Middle Ages. Quite the opposite, \nit should be able to integrate the values of two \ncivilizations that are, at their root, both from the same \narea, the Middle East. \n Climate change is another challenge that the \nworld is facing. Greenhouse gases are one of its causes. \nThe least developed poor countries, of which Niger is \nunfortunately a member, only produce 1 per cent of \nthose gases. We in Niger suffer from the effects of \nclimate change on a recurring basis. Indeed, our people \nlive off of subsistence agriculture and livestock-\nraising. Those two sectors, on which the poorest, in \nparticular women and children, rely, are very \nvulnerable to climate change. The droughts and floods \nin Niger over the past 10 years show, needless to say, a \ntrend towards a growing number of extreme weather \nevents.  \n In view of this, we decided to implement the \nThree Ns initiative, that is, \u201cthe people of Niger \nNourishing the people of Niger\u201d. As we believe that \ndrought does not need to necessarily bring about \nfamine, we have decided to increase the yields of rain-\nfed agriculture, to promote irrigation, to modernize \nlivestock-raising methods and to implement a robust \npolicy of environmental protection. As we know that \nthe harvest this season will be poor, we have decided to \nimplement an emergency irrigation programme, to \nrebuild our food stocks and to alert the international \ncommunity to the situation. From this rostrum I renew \nmy country\u2019s appeal to the international community for \naid for Niger, which, in addition to threats from the \nLibyan crisis, from terrorists and from criminal \norganizations of every kind, is also facing severe food \ninsecurity.  \n The terrible recurrent drought that Niger lives \nwith spurred our decision to restructure our economy. \nOur country has significant mineral resources \u2014 \nuranium, gold, coal, cement, which are already being \nmined, as well as oil, the first barrel of which will be \nproduced before the end of 2011. While the curse of \nmineral resources has had unfortunate results in other \ncountries, we will exploit our resources to the sole \nbenefit of the people of Niger. In accordance with the \nExtraction Industries Transparency Initiative, we mean \nto invest the profits to the benefit of the people of \nNiger, especially in agriculture, animal husbandry, \nenergy and transportation infrastructure, education, \nhealth and access to water. The resulting boost to our \neconomy will allow us to create tens of thousands of \njobs, especially for young people. Niger encourages \nprivate investment, especially foreign direct \ninvestment. Besides the legal protection we offer by \npromoting the rule of law, we have also just adopted a \nlaw on public-private partnerships in order to expedite \nfunding. \n We have the duty to create a fairer and more \nhumane world. To achieve that noble aim we need new \nglobal governance. That will require a profound reform \nof international organizations, in particular the United \nNations, the World Trade Organization, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The \ndemocratization of those institutions is absolutely \nnecessary; it is a sine qua non condition for peace and \nstability in the world. For decisions to be accepted and \nimplemented by everyone, they must be taken in a \ncollaborative, participatory way. \n I would like to focus now on our great \nOrganization. The United Nations is at once a \npermanent space for political dialogue among the \ncountries we represent and a forum for the expression \nof the solidarity necessary among our peoples. It is also \nwhere we turn for the realization of our hopes. For all \nthose reasons, reform of the United Nations must \nproceed faster. Africa takes a common position on this \nissue, which my country shares. We deeply believe \nthat, given its worldwide mandate to deal with major \nissues like peace, security, development and human \nrights, the United Nations must be fair, representative \nand democratic. We believe in an ongoing \nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the common \nforum that we all hold dear. We have no doubt that the \nPresident of the Assembly will move forward the \nprocess of democratizing the United Nations. The same \nis true of reform of the Security Council, which we all \nawait and which Africa has always called for, through \nits representatives, especially the Committee of Ten \nAfrican Ministers of Finance and Central Bank \nGovernors. \n  \n \n11-51191 20 \n \n Before concluding, I want to return to the theme \nof mediation. Our countries and the United Nations \nitself could increase their effectiveness in managing \nissues of peace, security and development if they \nsought resolution through mediation. The importance \nof the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes is incontestable. In fact, it is an essential tool \nin the peaceful settlement of disputes, which the \nCharter itself recommends to States in Article 33. \n In Niger we have experienced the benefits of \nmediation, through the United Nations, the African \nUnion and the Economic Community of West African \nStates, in our recent political and institutional crisis. It \nis true that mediation can be tedious, but in the end it \nbears fruit. We endorse every effort that aims to \npromote peace through mediation, both in active and \npotential conflicts. We also encourage the Department \nof Political Affairs to keep the principle in mind in its \nwork."

        "file_text": "I \nshould like, first of all, to associate myself with \nprevious speakers in congratulating the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and the \nmembers of the Bureau for their election. We would \nalso like to thank the President of the sixty-fifth \nsession for his work in presiding over the Assembly \nlast year. \n We also take this opportunity to congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to a \nsecond term as Secretary-General of the United \nNations. That reappointment is vivid testimony of his \nsuccesses in contributing to the promotion of \ninternational peace and security, human rights and \nsustainable development. \n The process of consolidating peace in Burundi, \nwith the support of the United Nations, led to the \nsuccessful organization of the 2010 elections through a \nprocess of consensus and thanks to an electoral code \nthat was published following consultations with all \nstakeholders. That spirit of dialogue in the process of \nconsolidating peace, also allowed our parliament to \nestablish an ombudsman position and an independent \nNational Human Rights Commission. This same \nprocess has allowed us to develop a second set of \ninstruments in our campaign against poverty, namely, \nthe law governing political parties, new property rights \ncodes, Burundi Vision 2025, a national strategy for \ndemocratic government, and the fight against \ncorruption. \n Genuine democracy now exists in Burundi. The \nexamples referred to earlier, along with maintaining \nchannels of communication, holding meetings with \ncivil society and the process of implementing \n \n \n23 11-51191 \n \ntransitional justice mechanisms, are all additional proof \nof this fact. Burundi has opened a dialogue with \neveryone. We can all note with satisfaction, then, that a \nnew chapter has been opened in the history of Burundi. \n Democratically elected institutions have led to \npeace for the first time. The people have decided what \nshould be done, and there has been a peaceful transfer \nof power. I pay tribute to the people of Burundi for \nbeing able to break with the tragic habits of the past, in \nwhich the outcome of elections was not respected. \nToday, the institutions that have been established are \nlegitimate and have the constitutional duty to protect \nthe people, ensure the stability of the country and \npromote development. \n Let us, however, have no illusions. There is still \ninsecurity in the aftermath of the socio-economic \nreinsertion of former combatants. There are also \nongoing problems with the transitional regime, along \nwith a temporary decline in the economic situation of \nour people, which is traceable to problems in \nagriculture, climate change and a spike in prices \ngenerally and oil. \n We should not forget the fact that Burundi is a \npost-conflict country. In that connection, we are \npleased by the surrender of more than 80,000 weapons, \nwhich people have handed over. Furthermore, a \ndisarmament commission has been established and the \nnational police have begun to scout for weapons and \nconfiscate them from criminals.  \n In the area of development, Burundi is continuing \nits efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals. The number of children is rising, as is that for \nteachers, because primary education is now free. We \nhave undertaken a number of reforms to train our \nyoung people for employment. The Government has \nundertaken to bring together people in villages so as to \nensure the provision of basic services such as drinking \nwater, energy, health care, schools and decent housing, \nwhich facilitates reconciliation, security and job \ncreation. This is in addition to free health care for \nchildren aged 5 and under and for pregnant women and \nwomen who give birth in public health clinics.  \n To that end, community-level endeavours have \nenabled us to build more than 2,024 schools and more \nthan 80 health centres and set up more than \n2,000 pumps for the provision of drinking water \u2014 all \nof this in three years and without any external \nassistance. \n Numerous development efforts are being \nundertaken in several key national sectors aimed at \nenhancing the lives of our people, taking advantage of \nthe integration of Burundi into the East African \ncommunity. \n We regret the continuing security-related \nincidents caused by armed bandits, land conflicts and \nthe presence of negative forces in certain areas of the \nGreat Lakes region. We were shocked by the terrible \ntragedy that took place in Gatumba on 18 September \n2011. On that dark night, a bloody attack took place in \na nightclub that caused the deaths of about 40 people \u2014 \nchildren, young people, elderly people \u2014 of all ethnic \ngroups, genders and political leanings.  \n The Government reached out to the suffering \npeople, paying the costs of the funerals and attending \nthem. The Government also decided to provide \ntreatment for all those who were injured during the \ntragedy, and a three-day period of mourning was \nannounced and observed. \n We strongly condemn that heinous attack and \nhave called for an inquiry, which should be concluded \nwithin a month. Thanks to genuine cooperation on the \npart of the people, who, having demonstrated \nconsiderable restraint, denounced those who allegedly \nplanned and carried out the attack, we are pleased to \nsay that we have made progress in the investigations.  \n This is yet a further reflection of the commitment \nof the people of Burundi to peace, which should \nreassure everyone with regard to the viability and \nstability of Burundi. That act, while it calls for further \nvigilance on the part of us all, should not be considered \nto reflect the current state of our country; if should be \nseen as an act of terrorism \u2014 an isolated incident \nwithin the overall context of peace in our country. Such \nacts of terrorism, massacres and crimes against \nhumanity are, unfortunately, being carried out in a \nnumber of countries, which makes it incumbent upon \nall of us firmly to combat them and bring their \nperpetrators to justice. \n We call on the international community to \nunreservedly condemn this heinous act and to assist us \nin prosecuting the masterminds and their henchmen. \nWe call also on the international community to support \nthe operationalization of the National Independent \nHuman Rights Commission that, in a positive step, was \nrecently established in Burundi. \n  \n \n11-51191 24 \n \n We take this opportunity also to note that \ninvestigation commissions are at work to shed light on \nthe assassinations that have taken place in various parts \nof the country. We hope that the truth about these \nevents will soon be known and those responsible will \nbe brought to justice. \n Our domestic situation is satisfactory, but we \ncannot but be aware of regional and international \nconcerns. Thus the situation in Somalia, in which \nBurundi is deeply involved through its participation in \nthe African Union Mission in Somalia, requires \nadditional partners in order for the country to be \nstabilized and prepared for elections. Those efforts \nshould be carried out in the context of international \nmeasures to combat terrorism and also to ensure food \nsecurity.  \n In order to be successful in the combat against \nterrorism, global governance must be able to meet that \nchallenge. There is therefore an urgent need for reform \nof the Security Council and ongoing interaction \nbetween the Council and the General Assembly on all \nissues of global interest. \n Before closing, we would like to congratulate \nSouth Sudan on having joined the family of nations, \nand we support the resolve of the Sudan and of South \nSudan to seek ways to peacefully settlement post-\nreferendum issues.  \n We would like to close by calling on the \nAssembly to speed up the quest to find a balance \nbetween development and the survival of our planet."

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe Vietnamese delegation, I wish to congratulate you, \nSir, on your unanimous election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am \nconfident that your diplomatic skills and experience \nwill help to ensure the great success of the current \nsession. I would like to take this opportunity to express \nmy deep appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his \nsignificant contributions to the fruitful outcome of the \nsixty-fifth session. \n  \n \n11-51670 26 \n \n The Vietnamese delegation also wishes to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \nreappointment as Secretary-General. We believe that, \nwith the cooperation of Member countries, the \nSecretary-General will make ever greater contributions \nto the operations of the United Nations and, thus, to \nglobal peace and development. We most warmly \nwelcome the Republic of South Sudan as the \n193rd Member of the Organization. \n Today, peace, cooperation and development \nremain the over-arching themes of our time. Yet \ntensions and conflicts persist in most continents and \nregions, owing to unresolved differences within nations \nand the threat and use of force. Climate change, natural \ndisasters, pandemics, transnational crime, the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \ninternational terrorism are still the challenges that \ndemand effective responses. The world economy\u2019s \nunstable recovery, coupled with economic downturns \nin many developed nations, has exposed developing \ncountries to the risks of even more unequal terms of \ntrade, rising protectionism, dwindling financial \nresources and the erosion of gains relating to the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Multilateral \nnegotiations on issues of common interest, such as \ndisarmament and climate change, have not yielded \nresults that meet our expectations. \n The current situation compels nations to promote \ndialogue and cooperation so as to surmount common \nchallenges, man-made and natural alike. Peace, \nsecurity and stability remain the intense desire of all \nnations and are prerequisites for development. The key \nto success lies in each nation\u2019s own efforts, as well as \nin enhanced international cooperation and \nmultilateralism based on respect for the fundamental \nprinciples of international law and the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, while taking into account the \nlegitimate interests of all countries, especially \ndeveloping ones. In that regard, Viet Nam commends \nyou, Mr. President, on the theme that you have \nproposed for the general debate, namely, the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes. \n As rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General, \nnever has the United Nations been so relevant and so \nurgently needed by so many people around the world. \nIt must deliver concrete results that make a real \ndifference in the daily lives of the world\u2019s people. With \nits universal membership, the Organization \nundoubtedly enjoys a unique legitimacy and should \nthus be at the forefront of global governance and \nmultilateral cooperation. \n Over the past several years, the United Nations \nhas played a crucial role in ending conflicts and \npromoting peace processes in various regions. We \ndeeply value the initiatives that place the needs of the \npoorest and most vulnerable at the centre of the \ninternational agenda, as well as initiatives to mobilize \nresources and capacities to fulfil internationally agreed \naction plans, including the MDGs; facilitate \nmultilateral negotiations on climate change, as well as \non disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction; provide solutions to such pressing \nissues as desertification, non-communicable diseases, \nnuclear safety and security; and respond to the global \nfinancial and economic crisis. We cannot help \nmentioning the efforts of the United Nations funds, \nprogrammes and specialized agencies to establish \nnorms and set agendas in accordance with their \nmandates, so as to assist developing countries in their \ndevelopment endeavours. \n At the same time, the international community \nlooks to the Organization as a source of inspiration and \nstrength, as a universal organization that can act \ndecisively to counter any tendency that may undermine \nits credibility or contradict its fundamental values and \nfounding purposes and principles. The Organization is \ntherefore expected to uphold the values of peace and \nsecurity, international law and multilateralism. It is \nalso expected to become more responsive and effective \non the ground, with the ultimate objective of better \nserving the needs and interests of Member States, in \nparticular the developing countries. \n As world peace and security are always our top \npriority, the United Nations should continue its \nconcerted and coherent efforts to promote the peaceful \nsettlement of civil wars and local conflicts in various \nregions of the world, especially those in North Africa \nand the Middle East, while preventing others from \nerupting.  \n We must cultivate a culture of peace and dialogue \nand promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. In that \nregard, Viet Nam supports efforts to end violence and \nstrengthen national reconstruction and reconciliation in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. As regards Palestine\u2019s \napplication for full membership in the United Nations \nOrganization, Viet Nam wishes to underline the fact \nthat we recognized the State of Palestine in 1988. We \n \n \n27 11-51670 \n \nhave always supported the just struggle of the \nPalestinian people for their inalienable rights, \nincluding the right to establish an independent and \nsovereign State that coexists peacefully with Israel \nwith the pre-June 1967 borders. In that spirit, we affirm \nour strong support for Palestine\u2019s efforts to soon \nbecome a full United Nations Member. \n We support United Nations efforts to translate the \noutcomes of the 2010 Review Conference of the \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons and the recently concluded High-\nlevel Meeting on nuclear safety and security into \nconcrete results. We also support the Organization\u2019s \nefforts to revitalize the work of the Conference on \nDisarmament and move multilateral disarmament \nnegotiations forwards. \n In parallel with security concerns, the \ninternational community, with the United Nations at \nthe centre, should work for more equal international \nrelations, a fairer international economic and financial \narchitecture and more just institutions. Developing \ncountries must have a greater role and say in \ninternational governance. They should be enabled to \ntake part in the globalization process in a more \nproactive and effective manner. Developed countries, \nfor their part, should deliver on their obligations and \ncommitments, including the maintenance of \nmacroeconomic stability, contribution to the successful \nconclusion of the Doha Round, the elimination of \nunfair trade measures and an increase in development \nassistance.  \n Given the continued need to draw on the thinking \nand action towards a more stable and healthy global \neconomic environment, we wish to recommend that the \nUnited Nations convene a meeting in the General \nAssembly or the Economic and Social Council to \nfollow up the Outcome of the Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment (resolution 63/303), which was held in \nJune 2009. \n In the meantime, the United Nations should \nundertake measures to prevent the unilateral use of \neconomic means against developing countries. Viet \nNam strongly calls for an end to the economic embargo \nagainst the Republic of Cuba. \n Moreover, to promote inclusive and sustainable \ndevelopment, political commitment and efforts, with \nthe central coordinating role played by the United \nNations, must be doubled for the attainment of \nequitable and sustainable development for all. Four \nyears from the agreed target date of 2015, it is essential \nthat the global partnership for development be \nexpanded, both in breadth and depth, so as to provide \ncountries in need with relevant policy experience, \nresources and best practices to achieve the MDGs and \nmaintain the process thereof.  \n Equally important is to begin developing a vision \nfor a global development platform for the post-2015 \nperiod. We must also work much harder together to \nensure the fruitful outcomes of the forthcoming \nseventeenth session of the Conference of Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange in South Africa and the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development in Brazil. \n Viet Nam is committed to working with other \nMember States to revitalize the General Assembly as \nthe principal deliberative, policymaking and \nrepresentative organ, to enhance the overarching role \nof the Economic and Social Council in the \ndevelopment sphere, and to enlarge Security Council \nmembership and improve its working methods. We also \nlook forward to more coherent, consistent and effective \ndevelopment activities of the United Nations system so \nas to align them effectively with the national priorities \nof recipient countries. In an effort to contribute to \nUnited Nations reforms, Viet Nam has been active in \nimplementing the Delivering as One initiative and, \ntogether with the United Nations and other partners, \nhas made tangible progress. \n Viet Nam welcomes the adoption of resolution \n65/281 on the review of the Human Rights Council. We \nwish to stress that the operation of the Human Rights \nCouncil and other United Nations human rights \nmechanisms should continue to be improved in order to \nbecome more effective, consistent and efficient, while \nfocusing more on dialogue and experience-sharing. To \nfurther contribute to that end, we have presented Viet \nNam\u2019s candidature for membership of the Human \nRights Council for the term 2013-2016. \n The year 2011 is important for Viet Nam since we \nhave successfully organized the eleventh party \ncongress and the elections of State bodies. We have \nalso adopted a socio-economic development strategy \nfor the next decade. During the past 25 years of \ncomprehensive renewal, Viet Nam has made significant \nachievements in many aspects and the country has \n  \n \n11-51670 28 \n \nintegrated extensively into international life. We have \nmanaged to establish and strengthen stable and long-\nterm frameworks of relations with major countries and \nglobal and regional economic and political centres.  \n Building on those achievements, in the coming \nperiod, Viet Nam is determined to comprehensively \nstep up the renewal process, with higher quality and \neffectiveness, as well as national industrialization and \nmodernization, in combination with the development of \na knowledge-based economy. \n In an effort to broaden and deepen our relations \nwith other countries, Viet Nam will continue an \nindependent foreign policy for peace, cooperation and \ndevelopment. Viet Nam is a reliable friend and partner, \nas well as a responsible member of the international \ncommunity, working for the prosperity of every nation, \nnational independence, global peace, democracy and \nsocial progress.  \n We shall enhance international integration and \nproactively participate in and contribute to regional \nand international multilateral forums, such as the \nUnited Nations, the Asia-Europe Meeting, the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation, the Non-Aligned \nMovement and the Group of 77 and China, on solving \nglobal issues of nuclear security, nuclear disarmament, \ncrime prevention, climate change, sustainable \ndevelopment and cooperation on the Mekong River.  \n Furthermore, we are always willing to share with \nother countries our experiences in South-South and \ntripartite cooperation, financing for development, \nenhancing aid effectiveness and mainstreaming the \nMDGs into national socio-economic strategies. \n We shall work closely with the other members of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nand other stakeholders for peace, stability, cooperation \nand development in South-East Asia, East Asia and \nbeyond through ASEAN-led mechanisms and \ninstruments, such as the Treaty of Amity and \nCooperation in Southeast Asia, the South-East Asia \nNuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone, the ASEAN Regional \nForum and the East Asia Summit. \n In that regard, Viet Nam welcomes and supports \ncontributions to peace and security in the Eastern Sea. \nLike other ASEAN members, Viet Nam is strongly \ncommitted to dialogue and confidence-building \nmechanisms and stands ready to support and \nparticipate in any effort to find peaceful settlements to \ndisputes, in accordance with international law, \nincluding the 1982 United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea, and that are acceptable to all parties \nconcerned. Pending such a solution, we will, along \nwith the parties concerned, strictly observe the \nDeclaration on the Conduct of Parties in the Eastern \nSea. We welcome the stated commitments to working \ntogether towards the conclusion of a code of conduct in \nthe foreseeable future. \n This year\u2019s session of the General Assembly is \ntaking place at a crucial juncture as the world is faced \nwith daunting challenges. It is my firm belief that only \nby undertaking joint efforts and enhancing multilateral \ncooperation could we meet the expectations and \naspirations of our peoples and manage to set out the \nright direction for the long-term development of the \nUnited Nations. Viet Nam remains strongly committed \nto that endeavour."

        "file_text": "My delegation offers \nPresident Al-Nasser its warm congratulations on his \nunanimous election as President of the General \nAssembly at the current session and pledges its \nunconditional support and cooperation in the discharge \nof his onerous responsibilities. \n I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to the \nSecretary-General on his well-deserved re-appointment \nand express my deep appreciation for his role in \nenhancing the role of the world Organization as a \npromoter of peace, security and development. His \nunanimous re-election to his high post is a testimony to \nhis outstanding leadership of the United Nations over \nthe past five years and a vote of strong confidence in \nhis future endeavours. \n On behalf of the people of Mongolia, I warmly \nwelcome South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the \nUnited Nations. \n Today the international community finds itself in \ntimes of uncertainty. The recovery from the economic \nand financial crisis has been uneven and sluggish. Its \nsocial repercussions have been intensified by persistent \nunemployment and poverty in many countries. Major \nnatural disasters occur all too often. Unprecedented \nchallenges stemming from climate change continue and \nremain unaddressed. \n The world\u2019s population will reach 7 billion next \nmonth, and it is a cause of great concern that over a \nbillion still suffer from hunger. The global economic \nand financial crisis grossly affected our drive to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. A number \nof international negotiations and mediation efforts on \nconflict resolution have yet to produce results. \n In today\u2019s globalized world, these challenges \nrequire collective solutions. To this end, the existing \ngovernance structure ought to be improved and \nreformed. The involvement of international \norganizations is critical to this process. The thematic \ndiscussions on enhancing the role of the United \nNations in global economic governance and dialogues \nwith the Chairman of the Group of 20, held during the \nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, were the \nfirst important step. What we need to do now is to \nenhance the role and status of the United Nations, \nincluding the Economic and Security Council, in global \neconomic decision-making. \n \n \n19 11-50702 \n \n It has also become imperative to ensure full and \non-time delivery of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) and to formulate the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. That agenda should help ensure \nthe meaningful integration of developing countries into \nthe world economy, taking into account the \nvulnerabilities of landlocked least-developed countries \nand those susceptible to desertification and climate \nchange. The Doha Development Round of multilateral \ntrade negotiations, stalled for the past decade, has yet \nto produce positive results towards this end. \n Every sixth Member of the United Nations is a \nlandlocked developing country whose remoteness from \nworld markets and high transport costs are a major \nimpediment to its development. Along with other \nmembers of this group, Mongolia is endeavouring to \nadvance our common interests at the United Nations \nand in the World Trade Organization. The creation of \nan international think tank for landlocked developing \ncountries, to be set up in Ulaanbaatar, will \nunquestionably contribute to greater cooperation in the \nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action \nand our relevant MDGs. I therefore call on all the \nrelevant parties to sign and ratify the multilateral \nagreement establishing this institution, which will be \nvitally important to landlocked developing countries. \n Last year, we reviewed our progress in achieving \nthe MDGs and agreed to strengthen the partnership. \nYet, as was shown in the most recent MDG Gap Task \nForce report, significant gaps remain in delivering on \ncommitments in the areas of aid, trade, debt relief and \naccess to new technologies. For Mongolia, 66 percent \nof our MDGs are achievable by 2015. But our goals \nrelating to poverty, environmental degradation and \ngender inequality are seriously off-track and will \nrequire stepped-up action on the part of the \nGovernment and the enhancement of our bilateral and \nmultilateral partnerships if we are to meet these \nchallenges. \n Mongolia has been implementing targeted \npolicies and activities aimed at poverty reduction. \nAlcoholism is one of the serious social ills associated \nwith poverty. As President, I initiated a nationwide \nmovement aimed at stopping alcohol abuse, curbing its \nconsumption and encouraging abstinence that has \nenjoyed wide public support. With a view to \nencouraging such movements in other countries, it \nmight be useful to look into the possibility of \npromulgating an international convention aimed at \nreducing alcohol consumption. \n Climate change, drought, land degradation and \ndesertification have emerged as some of the gravest \nchallenges facing humankind. Yesterday\u2019s High-level \nMeeting on desertification marked an important step \nforward in finding collective solutions to these \nchallenges. It is a matter of great concern that 2 billion \npeople and about 50 per cent of agricultural land \naround the globe are affected by desertification, land \ndegradation and drought. We should therefore set up an \nintergovernmental panel to conduct a comprehensive \nstudy on the effects of these phenomena and to identify \naction-oriented recommendations for affected \ncountries. \n We look forward to the seventeenth Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, to be held in Durban, \nSouth Africa, later this year, to discuss a significant \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the \ndevelopment of green economies. I believe that the \nglobal transition to a green economy is critically \nimportant for mitigating climate change and halting \ndesertification, land degradation, ecosystem \ndestruction and the loss of biodiversity, and that these \nin turn will help reduce poverty. \n Financial assistance and expertise are vital to \ndeveloping countries, including my own, in their \nefforts to develop a green economy through the \nintroduction of green technologies and by building \nnational capacity in energy production, construction \nand agriculture. I trust that the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development will produce \nresults that can take us further down this road. As a \ncountry highly vulnerable to the impact of climate \nchange, Mongolia is supportive of global efforts to \ncombat its negative effects. With that in view, \nMongolia will host the Asia-Europe Environment \nMinisters\u2019 Meeting on Sustainable Water and Forest \nManagement in 2012. \n The past year has witnessed dramatic \ntransformations. The Arab Spring has brought freedom \nto millions, but it is far from over. The revolution for \nfreedom is not the hardest social change to make. \nBuilding and developing a free, open and fair civic \nsociety is even more difficult. That is what our \nancestors taught us, and these lessons have been \nreinforced during our own democratic transformation \n  \n \n11-50702 20 \n \nover the past 20 years. Let me cite here the visionary \nteaching of the founder of the great Mongolian State, \nChinggis Khaan, who was rightly chosen as the Man of \nthe Millennium. Chinggis Khaan once said that \nconquering the world on horseback is easy; it is \ndismounting and governing that is much harder. The \nrevolution for freedom is fought and won by the \ncombined efforts of thousands of people. However, in \none way or another, it is each and every person who \npays the price for freedom. It is my firm belief that \nnotwithstanding any challenges it faces, freedom is the \nfuture of all humankind. \n Beginning in July, Mongolia assumed the \nhonourable and responsible duties of President of the \nCommunity of Democracies, an organization geared to \npromoting and strengthening democratic norms and \nvalues around the world. During its presidency over the \nnext two years, Mongolia will give priority to \npromoting education for democracy and good \ngovernance, eliminating corruption, building \npartnerships with civil society and consolidating \nregional cooperation. \n Over the past 20 years of our own democratic \nchanges, Mongolia has fundamentally transformed its \nformer political, social and economic systems and laid \ndown all the necessary foundations for new democratic \ngovernance, promoting and protecting a market \neconomy, free elections, freedom of the press and civil \nsociety. We feel rightly proud of these \naccomplishments. \n We are fully aware, however, that many things \nare far from perfect and that a lot more must be done to \nnurture democratic values in every citizen. Most of all, \nwe must consolidate accountable and transparent \ngovernance, free from corruption and secured by an \nindependent judiciary. Such governance should be \nmore responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens, serve \nthem, abide by the rule of law and the principle of \nimpartiality, and have proper checks and balances. In \nshort, we are striving to develop a system of \ngovernance that values its people and treats them with \ndignity and respect. \n To address these challenges and threats to \ndemocracy and an open society, we are implementing a \nMongolia-specific MDG 9 on democratic governance, \nhuman rights and zero tolerance for corruption. Within \nthis goal, we are endeavouring to make our governance \nopen and transparent; hence our full support for the \nOpen Government Partnership initiative. I would also \nlike to call on all Member States attempting to improve \ntheir governance at the national level to join the Zero \nTolerance for Corruption Campaign. \n The Arab Spring will be followed by the Arab \nChallenge. Although the democratic process is a \nhomegrown phenomenon, it should be supported by \ninternational cooperation. Here, I have a message for \nthe industrialized democratic countries: Do not \nwithdraw from the battle. Democratization does not \nmean Westernization, however. Democracy should \ndevelop naturally, in line with the historical, cultural \nand development specifics of a given country. \nNonetheless, respect for freedom, justice and human \nrights and strict observance of the rule of law are \ncommon to all successful and responsible democracies. \nBad governance is the worst problem of all, and any \naspirations to improve and streamline it should \ntherefore be strongly supported at all times. \n Libya has entered a new era as a result of the \nrelentless courage and patience of the rebels, who \npersevered for many months in their struggle for \nfreedom, human rights and democracy. Colonel \nAl-Qadhafi called his fellow countrymen \u201crats\u201d who \nshould be brutally hunted down and exterminated. Now \nhe himself is being hunted like a rat from hole to hole \nand trench to trench. That is the fate that awaits anyone \nwho represses people\u2019s love for freedom and their \ndesire to live in dignity. Respectful of the aspirations \nof the Libyan people, Mongolia has recognized the \nNational Transitional Council and offers its full support \nto Libya\u2019s transition towards democracy, justice and \nhuman rights. \n The international community should not shy \naway from condemning the regime of Syria\u2019s Bashar \nAl-Assad, who has inhumanly and brutally chosen the \nway of bloodshed to crack down on peaceful, freedom- \nand justice-craving protesters by using combat \nvehicles, snipers and military force. Let us \nunanimously demand that he end his atrocities. We \nmust make the necessary decision to that effect without \ndelay, and help the courageous people of Syria, who \nare losing dozens of their brave sons and daughters \nevery day. \n The love of freedom is the greatest force in this \nworld. No tyranny, not even the cruellest regime, can \nresist it forever. I direct these words to the authorities \n \n \n21 11-50702 \n \nof Yemen and dictators seeking to suppress their \ncitizens\u2019 fight for freedom. \n It was a timely decision to make \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d the main theme of this general debate. The \nmain purpose of the United Nations is to settle disputes \nby peaceful means. We commend the skilful diplomacy \nof the Secretary-General and his envoys in resolving \ndisputes and conflicts in various corners of the world. \nMember States need to work together to strengthen the \nUnited Nations capacity to that end. \n North-East Asia is a region where mediation \nactivities can be vigorously pursued. The region still \nlacks a formal mechanism for building confidence and \nstrengthening regional cooperation. Therefore, we \nbelieve that Mongolia\u2019s proposal to set up a permanent \nmechanism to promote peace and stability in North-\nEast Asia remains valid. We are ready to consult with \nrelevant countries to move forward with out proposal. \n On 11 September 10 years ago, terrorists tore \ndown the twin towers, but they failed to tear down the \nspirit of freedom they represented, and they will never \nsucceed in doing that. Mongolia stands with the \ninternational community in its fight against terrorism \nas a party to all of the United Nations conventions to \ncombat terrorism. \n We need to reinvigorate our resolve to attain a \nworld free of nuclear weapons and to exploit nuclear \npower solely for peaceful purposes. We were reminded \nof the urgency and importance of strengthening the \nsafety and security of nuclear reactors by the tragic \naccident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant \nlast March. \n We commend the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to \nhold a high-level meeting tomorrow to strengthen \ninternational measures for nuclear safety and security \naround the world. The 2010 Review Conference of the \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons gave renewed impetus for expanding \nnuclear weapon-free zones around the world. The \nproposed nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East \nwould contribute to the promotion of world peace. \n Mongolia continues to work on further \nstrengthening its internationally recognized nuclear \nweapon-free status. To this end, we are holding \nconsultations with nuclear Powers. From the highly \nesteemed rostrum of the General Assembly, I would \nlike to underscore that there should be no doubt that \nMongolia will never accede to the dumping of nuclear \nwaste on its territory. It should go without saying that, \nin today\u2019s world, any attempt to enforce such decisions \nwould undoubtedly fail. \n It is of historic importance to us that the \nobservance of the fiftieth anniversary of Mongolia\u2019s \njoining this global Organization coincides with this \nsession of the General Assembly. On 27 October 1961, \nMongolia became a full Member of the United Nations. \nIt has opened new frontiers of active engagement with \nthe international community for the global good. \nFurthermore, this year Mongolia is marking the \n2,220th anniversary of its statehood, centenaries of \nregaining its independence and the establishment of a \nmodern diplomatic service, as well as the ninetieth \nanniversary of the people\u2019s revolution. \n Over the past five decades, cooperation between \nMongolia and the United Nations has expanded both in \nscope and substance. Today Mongolia is a party to \nmore than 240 multilateral conventions and enjoys \nmembership in over 110 international organizations. \nUnited Nations assistance and cooperation have been \ninstrumental in developing human resources and \ncapacity-building, developing education, health and \ninformation technology, reducing poverty and \ndeveloping an adequate response to natural disasters. \n For its part, Mongolia has also endeavoured to \ncontribute where it could to the joint efforts of the \ninternational community. My delegation is pleased to \nrecall that, at the initiative of Mongolia, the General \nAssembly adopted the Declaration on the Rights of \nPeoples to Peace, the principles and guidelines for \ninternational negotiations, resolutions on the annual \nobservance of Disarmament Week, the United Nations \nLiteracy Decade and resolutions relating to \ncooperatives, rural women and landlocked developing \ncountries. Mongolian troops have courageously served \nin the blue United Nations helmet in many hotspots \naround the world, including in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Western Sahara, South Sudan, \nEritrea, Georgia, Sierra Leone, Chad and Darfur. \n All in all, over the past five decades Mongolia \nhas been faithful to its obligations under the Charter \nand striven to be an active Member State. We stand \nstrongly committed to further contributing to the \nmultifaceted activities of the United Nations. I am \npleased to announce our decision to present our \n  \n \n11-50702 22 \n \ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \nCouncil for the term 2023-2024 at the elections to be \nheld at the seventy-seventh session of the General \nAssembly, and humbly seek members\u2019 valuable \nsupport. \n The contribution and leadership of the United \nNations in maintaining international peace, security \nand promoting sustainable development continue to \ngrow. In this respect, I call on the General Assembly to \ndevelop relevant solutions and decisions at this session \naimed at supporting the aspirations of countries and \npeoples to better livelihoods. \n The day-to-day activities of the United Nations \nare of paramount importance to the cause of creating a \nsafe, free and just life for humankind, in which \neveryone may enjoy integrity and dignity. We are \nconfident that the United Nations will succeed in its \ncontinued reform efforts to this end."

We are indebted to many friends in this \ngreat Hall, without whose efforts it would not have \nbeen easy for us to get where we are today. We owe a \ndebt of gratitude to the countries of the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), \nthe troika States, and the friends and partners of IGAD, \nwho waged a struggle for peace for the Sudan that \nculminated in the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement (CPA) in 2005. As an emergent nation that \nhas been embroiled in conflict during different periods \nof time, all of which add up to more than five decades, \nthe Republic of South Sudan stands in dire need of all \nthe help it can get.  \n In most post-conflict situations, nations would \nnormally expect to rebuild. That is not the case for us. \nEven before the ravages of war set in, our country had \nnothing worth rebuilding. Hence, we characterize our \n \n \n21 11-51185 \n \npost-conflict mission as one of construction rather than \nreconstruction, and we therefore hope that the \noverwhelming outpouring of support and sympathy \nthat greeted our independence from all corners of the \nglobe will translate into tangible development \nassistance for South Sudan. Our march out of the abyss \nof poverty and deprivation into the realm of progress \nand prosperity is going to be a long one, and that is \nwhy we need members to partner us on this difficult \njourney. \n Although nature has endowed our country with \nsome resources, notably oil and other mineral wealth, \nwe hardly produce anything for ourselves \u2014 at least \nnot yet. We are determined to diversify the economy of \nour country and lessen our precarious and near total \ndependence on oil. Our strategy is to use the oil as a \ncatalyst to unlock the potential we have in other areas, \nespecially in agriculture. \n Oil is a non-renewable resource that will \ninevitably be depleted at some point in the future, but \nwe know that the land, water and human resources at \nour disposal will continue to be our country\u2019s true, \ninexhaustible fount of wealth. The ambition of the \npeople of South Sudan is to be able to transform their \ncountry into a regional agro-industrial powerhouse, but \nwithout a helping hand from others the attainment of \nthis goal will indeed remain a tall order. Much as we \nneed external assistance, it is our passionate wish that \nit be offered on terms that will also respect our \npolitical and economic choices. \n The Republic of South Sudan is under no illusion \nthat economic development and prosperity can be \nachieved in the absence of a climate of peace and \nstability. We shall therefore strive to promote peace \nand harmony not only internally but also between all of \nour neighbours and us. Inside South Sudan, we have \nset up broad-based executive and legislative organs of \nGovernment that are inclusive of key political parties. \nWe did so despite the fact that our party, the Sudan \nPeople\u2019s Liberation Movement, won a landslide in the \nrecent elections.  \n We were not deterred from installing such an \naccommodative Government by the fact that we do not \neven yet have in place the requisite legal framework \ngoverning political party activity. We took those steps \nnot only because of our commitment to political \npluralism, but primarily because of our strong \nconviction that measures of inclusion such as these can \nfoster peace and harmony. \n In the external domain, we remain strongly \ncommitted to maintaining peaceful and mutually \nbeneficial relations with all States, and particularly \nwith our neighbours. In that regard, I wish to affirm \nthat the Republic of South Sudan fully adheres to the \nprinciple of absolute respect for the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of all States, including the Republic \nof the Sudan. Therefore, the Republic of South Sudan \nhereby categorically restates that it has not interfered \nand will not interfere in any domestic conflict situation \nin the Republic of the Sudan. \n However, on account of the fact that conflict \nareas in the Republic of the Sudan border our country \nand that any spillover effects from those could \nnegatively impact our own security, we urge the \nGovernment of the Sudan to seek a peaceful resolution \nto those conflicts. We would like to emphasize in \nparticular that the reinstatement by the Government of \nthe Sudan of the recent Addis Ababa framework accord \non the situation in Southern Kordofan State and \npolitical relations between the Government and the \nopposition could go a long way towards promoting the \nrestoration of peace in the areas bordering South \nSudan. \n There are a number of outstanding issues that \nhave carried over from the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement. We hope to expeditiously resolve them so \nas to ensure the complete normalization of relations \nbetween the two States and the start of a new era of a \npositive and mutually beneficial relationship that will \nbe predicated on the commonalities shared by the \npeople of the two States. We therefore urge the \nGovernment of the Republic of the Sudan to consent to \nthe speedy demarcation of the border between the two \nStates, with the help of the international community. \nWe hope that Khartoum will no longer object to such \nan arrangement, given that South Sudan is now a \nsovereign State.  \n We would also like to plead with the Government \nof the Republic of the Sudan to agree to the submission \nof our dispute over the ownership of a number of \nborder areas to international arbitration. The \nGovernment of the Republic of South Sudan applauds \nthe cooperation of the Government of the Republic of \nthe Sudan in paving the way to the deployment of the \nUnited Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei, and \n  \n \n11-51185 22 \n \nhopes that the two countries will reach agreement \nsooner rather than later on the resolution of the Abyei \nissue, in line with the relevant provisions of the CPA. \n On the economic front, South Sudan wishes to \ndeclare that it is willing and ready to outline serious \nnegotiations with Khartoum. That will be done with the \naim of reaching mutually acceptable arrangements that \nwill guarantee for the Republic of the Sudan a fair \nincome from the use of Sudan\u2019s oil export \ninfrastructure. \n In terms of governance, we have moved to rectify \nsome of the defects in our system by strengthening the \npillars of good governance. A number of key bills \u2014 \nnotable among which is a public financial management \nbill \u2014 are now making their way steadily through the \nlegislative process. The passage of such laws will help \npromote accountability and transparency and \nultimately curb corruption and the unwarranted loss of \npublic revenue. \n In conclusion, the new Republic of South Sudan \nvows to become an active member of the global family \nof nations, making its contribution to fostering world \npeace and prosperity for the benefit of all humankind."

        "file_text": "We are \npleased to sincerely and warmly congratulate \nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession and to his brotherly country, Qatar, with which \nwe share deep fraternal relations. We are confident that \nhis diplomatic experience, especially in the field of \nmultilateral diplomacy, will have a great impact on the \nsuccess of this session. We wish also to express our \nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss of \nSwitzerland, for his successful efforts in the conduct of \nthe previous session. We also extend our \ncongratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on \nthe international community\u2019s renewed confidence in \nhim, as evidenced by his re-election to his post for a \nsecond term, so that he can continue his efforts to \nrevitalize the role of the United Nations and further \ndevelop its work. \n Each year, when we address the Assembly from \nthis rostrum, we begin by presenting the issue of the \nPalestinian people. The international community has \nworked to encourage negotiations between the \nPalestinian National Authority and the Government of \nIsrael, the occupying Power. Unfortunately, the \nsituation remains at a standstill. For that reason, the \nglobal community, and the United Nations in \nparticular, should act to fulfil its responsibility to find a \njust and comprehensive solution. We believe that the \nestablishment of a Palestinian State on the basis of the \nborders of 4 June 1967 and the recognition of that State \nas a Member of the Organization will undoubtedly lead \nto serious negotiations aimed at reaching a just, lasting \nand comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli \nconflict. \n Brotherly Somalia has been the victim of a \ndecades-long civil war caused by a weak leadership \nthat failed to reach a political consensus to end that \nhateful war. We believe that, to save the Somali people \nfrom the threefold threat of poverty, ignorance and \nfamine, the time is ripe for the United Nations to \nintensify its efforts, in cooperation with regional \norganizations, including the League of Arab States, the \nAfrican Union, the Organization of Islamic \nCooperation and the Inter-Governmental Authority on \nDevelopment, to devise a plan to bring peace to \nSomalia. We would also stress the importance of \nincreasing the provision of humanitarian assistance to \nthe millions of Somali refugees and displaced persons. \nWe are confident that Somalia\u2019s neighbours share our \nbelief in the need for political solutions to the chronic \ncrisis in that country. We also reiterate to the Secretary-\nGeneral that we are fully prepared to support the \nefforts of the United Nations in that regard. \n On 26 January 2011, my country submitted its \nperiodic report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva \nin the context of the mechanism for the periodic review \nof States\u2019 reports. We in the Sultanate of Oman are \nsatisfied that we have come a long way in terms of \nprotecting human rights at all levels. We consider this a \nnational and spiritual commitment aimed at achieving \njustice that also supports the dimension of a global \nculture of human rights protection. \n Our contemporary world is witnessing profound \nchanges in the demographic composition of the peoples \nof the world, as young people now constitute the \nmajority of the world population. As they are the most \nambitious group, capable of mapping the future, the \ninternational community should take this reality into \nconsideration in the elaboration of all manner of plans \nin the economic, education and sustainable \ndevelopment fields. \n As our region is experiencing such profound \nchanges, we, like the rest of the world, believe that the \naspirations of young people to a better and more secure \nworld and decent livelihoods have prevailed and \nshould be accepted and welcomed by all Governments. \nWe in the Sultanate of Oman, in keeping with the \ninstructions given by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin \nSaid, have based all of our national economic and \nsocial plans on empowering young people to make \nmaximum use of their potential to benefit from \ntechnology and to achieve a society characterized by \nprosperity and sustainable growth. \n  \n \n11-51384 52 \n \n Today\u2019s world is facing numerous crises that \nmake it imperative for the international community to \nwork jointly to create conditions that are conducive to \nfinding solutions. The world may be on the brink of a \nwidespread food crisis, and many people live in fear of \nfood shortages. Efforts must therefore be made at the \ninternational level to expand production through the \ncultivation of larger areas and the use of advanced \ntechnology to increase yields and to combat \ndesertification in vulnerable areas. \n The continuing global financial crisis obliges us \nto collectively rethink the principles underlying \ninvestment and international trade in order to reach \nappropriate solutions aimed at reducing the negative \nimpacts of the crisis on countries and societies, \nparticularly in the developing world.  \n An additional issue we must face is that of global \nphenomena such as hurricanes, earthquakes and the \nhigh level of environmental pollution, all of which lead \nto major human and economic losses. We believe that \nall countries, particularly the major industrialized \ncountries, should join together to find a solution aimed \nat reducing industrial and environmental pollution and \ngreenhouse-gas emissions based on modern technology \nin those fields. \n In closing, we are hopeful that all countries will \nseize the opportunity offered by the current session to \ntake practical steps and measures on all of the issues \nunder discussion. We hope that the session will meet \nwith every success."

        "file_text": "\nWe extend our warmest congratulations to the \nAmbassador from Qatar, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser, on his recent election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We \nwelcome his intention to use this session to address \npressing issues such as mediation and conflict \nresolution, the reform of the United Nations system, \npreventing and responding to natural disasters and \nsustainable development for global prosperity. \n Ten years ago, the dynamic and vibrant city of \nNew York was shocked by something previously \ninconceivable: the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers. \nThousands of innocent people died in horrific ways, \nleaving relatives and friends in a state of helplessness \nand sorrow. Echoes of that terror reverberated around \nthe planet, leaving scars and a trail of pain to this day. \nThe world has not been the same since then. \n In the interest of security, even in strong \ndemocracies where genuine rule of law prevails, some \nindividual liberties, previously considered sacred and \nimmutable, have been sacrificed. While the ashes were \nstill smouldering and the rubble of the Twin Towers \nstill lay where it fell, the war in Afghanistan was \nlaunched, which, although perhaps justified as a case \nof legitimate defence, has nevertheless produced more \nvictims than the terrorist attacks themselves. Then \ncame the occupation of Iraq, which spurred \ncontroversy in various circles of international public \nopinion but in any case certainly generated more \nviolence, produced new victims and new waves of \nhuman suffering and caused more destruction of \nwealth. \n The lesson to be learned from these past 10 years \nis that there must be a collective effort to eliminate \nterrorism as an inhuman practice, to eliminate as well \nthe economic, social, political, cultural, ideological and \nreligious factors that fuel it, and to promote a world \nthat is more open, more tolerant, more respectful and \nmore willing to engage in dialogue and in the \nrecognition of human dignity. \n Another event that has shaken the world during \nthe past decade has been the global financial crisis, \nproduced by a lack of clear rules in the international \nfinancial system, as well as by arrogance, greed and the \nunquenchable thirst for wealth. That crisis has gone \nthrough several stages, but at this moment what is most \nworrisome is that it has caused a division among the \nmost influential and powerful political and economic \nsectors in the world over strategies to fix it. While \nsome think that what is needed at this time is public-\nspending stimulus policies to promote economic \ngrowth and job creation, others emphasize reducing \nfiscal deficits and paying off sovereign debt. \n How can international capital markets now \ndemand that Governments pay a debt that was created, \nto a large extent, to save financial institutions from \ngoing under in the first place? Although incongruous, \n \n \n11 11-50871 \n \nthat is exactly what is taking place. Markets are \ncurrently putting pressure on States to pay sovereign \ndebts that were themselves essentially the result of \nearlier initiatives by States to rescue banks that were \neither at risk or on the brink of bankruptcy.  \n In order to avoid having to stop payments or \ndefaulting and watching their economies crumble \nfurther, Governments have had to give in to the \npressure of the markets by implementing severe \nausterity measures. Those policies have significantly \ndecreased citizens\u2019 quality of life, leading to social \nunrest and protest movements that erode Governments\u2019 \nlegitimacy and support base. Although it might seem \nparadoxical, in some developed countries loss of \npopular support has caused Governments to fall, \nwhich, in echoes of coups d\u2019\u00e9tat, have led to a new \npolitical phenomenon that might be called, for lack of a \nbetter word, market \u201ccoups\u201d. \n What is strange about this situation is that what \nwe need is resources to save the international financial \nsystem, stabilize the world economy and return us to \nour earlier levels of economic growth and prosperity \u2014 \nand those resources are at hand. For example, it is \nknown that even though $4 trillion circulate every day \naround the world in the form of financial transactions \nin capital markets, no taxes are in place that would \nincrease States\u2019 fiscal resources.  \n How much would Governments collect through a \n5 per cent tax on the $4 trillion circulating daily around \nthe world? That would represent $20 billion per day, \nwhich, multiplied by five business days a week, would \ncome to a total of $100 billion. If, in turn, we multiply \nthat number by four weeks a month we would have \nmonthly income of $400 billion. And those $400 billion \nmonthly, multiplied by 12 months in a year, amount to \nan astronomical $4.8 trillion. That amount would not \nonly resolve the problems of some countries\u2019 sovereign \ndebt but there would be enough fresh resources for \ninvesting, which would allow a rapid recovery from the \ncurrent financial and economic world crisis. \n Nonetheless, were we to conclude that this was \nnot an appropriate way for States to raise revenue, \nwhat about the more than 10 trillion dollars deposited \nin tax havens, according to reports by international \nadvisory institutions? \n As we know, not a cent from those deposits, \nwhich increase by more than 600 billion dollars every \nyear, reaches the tax services of any Government. \n In the meantime, through our failure to tax \ninternational financial transactions and the deposits \nmade in tax havens, the global financial and economic \ncrisis continues, citizens become indignant as they see \ntheir standard of living erode, social demonstrations \nmultiply, Governments are threatened by the lack of \ngovernance, chaos takes over societies, and uncertainty \nexpands everywhere. \n In sum, we are forced to accept increasingly \nalarming levels of social injustice because of the \nundeniable and uncontrollable power held by a circle \nof the world\u2019s economic elite. \n Despite the wide range of global problems before \nus, I wish to address just one of them: financial \nspeculation on the price of food and oil. The \nDominican Republic will submit a draft resolution on \nthe subject to this Assembly General. \n Since 2005 there has been a steady increase in the \nprices of food and oil, along with that of petroleum \nby-products.  \n From 2006 to 2008, the price of soya beans has \nincreased 107 per cent; the price of corn, 125 per cent; \nrice, 127 per cent; and wheat, 136 per cent. \n According to the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), as a result \nof those price increases, 150 million people joined \nthose around the world who already literally go hungry. \n As a result, for the first time in the history of \nhumankind, the total number of people who lack access \nto food surpassed 1 billion, which represents almost a \nsixth of the world population. \n With the recession that took place during the \nsecond half of 2008, food prices went down, and it was \nthought that we would return to a situation of \naccessible food prices and overall increased stability.  \n However, with the slight upturn and reactivation \nof the world economy in 2010, prices went up again, \nand this year the ravages of inflation have been felt \nonce again in different parts of the world. \n The same has happened with the price of oil. \nAfter falling to $12 a barrel in 1998, ten years later, in \nJuly 2008, two months before the bankruptcy of \nLehman Brothers, it was priced at $147 a barrel. \n  \n \n11-50871 12 \n \n Paradoxically, at the end of 2008, oil prices had \ndropped so precipitously that the new price on the \ninternational market was $37 a barrel. \n Who could possibly explain something as absurd \nas a price drop from $147 to $37 a barrel in just four \nmonths? \n It has been argued that, with regard to both food \nand oil, those exorbitant price increases can be \nexplained by the growth of the world population, an \nincrease in demand from emerging economies, \nespecially China and India, the effects of climate \nchange, and geo-political tensions in regions of the \nworld affected by conflict. \n There can be no doubt that some of those factors \nhave influenced prices to some extent, but there has \nalso been a clear effort to downplay the importance of \na new element in international markets: financial \nspeculation in commodity futures. \n According to well-known international analysts, \n30 to 40 per cent of the price increases for \ncommodities or basic products can be ascribed to the \nimpact or influence of financial speculation on futures \ncontracts. \n In light of that situation, which has a daily impact \non our food- and oil-importing people, the Dominican \nRepublic has weighed the need to propose regulatory \nmeasures of international scope in order to guarantee \nmarket transparency and price stability. \n To that end, it is essential to limit the volume of \ntransactions that may be executed by such futures \nmarket participants as insurance companies, investment \nbanks, pension funds and equity funds, among others, \nwhich play no direct part in the physical production of \nthe product. \n Likewise, deposits on futures contracts should be \nraised, as a way to discourage speculative transactions \nthat only contribute to price volatility and create \nuncertainty and a lack of market predictability. \n We believe that by adopting such a resolution we \nwill take an important step towards solving a serious \nproblem that has condemned a large part of humankind \nto hunger and destitution. \n In sum, the objective of this initiative is simple, \njust, and of far-reaching importance, namely, to \npersuade the Assembly General of the United Nations \nto declare, for the sake of the human race, that food \ncannot be considered a financial asset. \n Food must be used only to guarantee the survival \nof the human race on the face of the Earth."

        "file_text": "It gives me great \npleasure to congratulate the President on his election to \nlead the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I \nwish to assure him of the full cooperation of my \ndelegation in successfully discharging his high \nresponsibilities. I would also like to express our \nappreciation to his predecessor for his excellent \nstewardship of the Assembly\u2019s previous session. And \nallow me to take this opportunity to once again \ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \nreappointment to a second term, and to express our \nadmiration for work well done during his first term. \n It is with a great sense of brotherhood that I \nwarmly welcome the Republic of South Sudan to the \nfamily of our global Organization and offer our sincere \ncongratulations and best wishes to the newest Member \nState. We also welcome the Libyan delegation, which \nwe recognized some time ago. We are not oblivious to \nthe Herculean challenge that they face. \n The globalizing world has always presented \nchallenges to Africa and the developing world. \nHowever, the negative developments over the past few \nyears, which appear to be far from being mitigated, \nhave made it even more difficult for countries such as \nours to move ahead on the path to development as fast \nas we would have liked and our potential and \ncommitment would have allowed. There is a need for a \nredoubled effort so that the achievements of the \nMillennium Development Goals are not frustrated. \nThat was also the hope of the fourth United Nations \nConference on the Least Developed Countries. For our \npart, we feel that we have been on track for almost all \nthe targets, and our commitment is to be even more \nambitious, in line with our five-year Growth and \nTransformation Plan. Nevertheless, the global \neconomic situation is a source of concern. \n \n \n37 11-51384 \n \n Within that global context, the Horn of Africa has \nbeen hit by the worst adverse climatic conditions in 60 \nyears, causing a very tragic drought situation. At this \ncritical juncture, the international community should be \ngalvanized, particularly in helping to alleviate the \ncrisis in Somalia. The call made on Saturday at the \nmini-summit on that issue needs to be reiterated and \namplified. We should do more for the people of \nSomalia and those others in the region who have been \naffected by the calamity. \n Even more crucial in the Horn of Africa is \nsustainable development. Our youth need to have their \nhopes for the future not frustrated, and the condition of \nour women and children requires much greater \nattention. On top of denying people their human rights, \npoverty is not a solid foundation on which peace and \nsecurity can be built. That need compels us to draw \nattention to a number of challenges that we, in the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \nregion, face, particularly with respect to climate \nchange. The adverse consequences of climate change \nare becoming evident in various ways. The challenges \nare global, requiring global solutions, on the basis of \ncommon but differentiated responsibility. We do not \nbelieve that enough is being done commensurate with \nthe gravity of the threat to humanity in general. \nMoreover, the whole issue embodies injustice because \nAfrica and the developing world happen to be the \nworst affected, while contributing the least to climate \nchange. \n As members of IGAD, we have for some time \ntried to bring our collective effort to bear on the \nvarious challenges the Horn of Africa faces. Realizing \nthe fact that one of the major factors hindering \ndevelopment in our region is related to security and the \nlack of durable stability, apart from doing our best to \nlay the basis for the integration of our subregion \nthrough various infrastructure-related projects, we have \ncontinued to strengthen our common endeavour for \npeace and security in the IGAD region.  \n The positive outcomes are there to be seen. No \nregional group has been as closely identified with \npeacemaking in the Sudan as IGAD. In Somalia, in \nclose collaboration with the East African Community, \nthe African Union and the United Nations, IGAD has \nbeen the lynchpin in the effort to assist the people of \nSomalia in achieving peace, stability and national \nreconciliation. Now, with the extremists and \nAl-Shabaab having been driven out of Mogadishu and \nthe tide turning against them, there is new hope in \nSomalia, which should be sustained. The Kampala \nAccord laid the basis for a breakthrough in Somalia, \nfor which we owe gratitude to President Yoweri \nMuseveni and Ambassador Mahiga, Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General. \n Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to \nUganda and Burundi for the sacrifices that they have \nmade, and continue to make, as the two countries that \nspearheaded the efforts of the African Union Mission \nand the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia to \nkeep those such as Al-Shabaab and their supporters at \nbay. It must be underlined that it is a fight that has \nhumanitarian and development implications, not only \nsecurity or political. That is why the successful \ncooperation of the IGAD countries for stability and \nsecurity in the Horn of Africa, and in the fight against \nterrorism and extremism, has been so vital. It requires \nthe wholehearted support of the international \ncommunity, the General Assembly and, most \nparticularly, the Security Council. \n I need not go into the details of what the IGAD \ncountries have requested of the Security Council in \nterms of support for them to succeed in the effort that \nthey are making for peace in Somalia and to contain \nthose who not only encourage, but also take part in \ncarrying out terrorism. It is particularly vital for the \nCouncil to act on the conclusions and \nrecommendations of a body established by the Council \nitself. Sweet talk, devoid of any behavioural change in \npractice and on the ground, should not lead the \nSecurity Council to wish away concrete evidence \npresented to it by a committee of its own creation. \n Let us admit that there are double standards in the \nfight against terrorism. Our counter-terrorism effort \ncannot succeed if we are selective in that struggle. The \nPrime Minister of India could not have been more \ncorrect when he said from this rostrum last Saturday:  \n \u201cThere cannot be selective approaches in dealing \nwith terrorist groups or the infrastructure of \nterrorism. Terrorism has to be fought across all \nfronts.\u201d () \n We in Ethiopia have never had a short-sighted \nperspective on what we need to do to ensure that our \nnational interest and our national security are \nprotected. In this day and age, it is only through \ncollective effort that we can ensure peace, security and \nstability. Some might imagine that they would benefit \n  \n \n11-51384 38 \n \nby encouraging discord in their neighbourhood. The \nHorn of Africa has suffered because of policies \nemanating from that kind of mindset for too long. That \nshould be combated. We seek the support of all fair-\nminded people in that endeavour.  \n For our part, we have been guided by the \nobjective of protecting and defending the collective \nsecurity interest of the people of our region. That has \nguided our policy in the Sudan and in the effort that we \nhave been making to nurture mutual confidence \nbetween us and both the Republic of Sudan and the \nnew nation of South Sudan. We have also followed that \nsignpost in conducting our policy with respect to \nSomalia. \n Ethiopia is not a newcomer to international \ndiplomacy. As a founding member of the United \nNations, we take our responsibility as members of the \nhuman family seriously. We view our vocation to be a \nfactor for strengthening international peace and \nsecurity and for enhancing friendly relations among \nnations, large or small, on the basis of full equality. \nThat is why, as we continue to call for the reform of \nthe Security Council, we also remain committed to the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the true \nrepresentative of the people of the world in the true \nspirit of the United Nations Charter, whose very first \nphrase is: \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d. \n In that same spirit, Ethiopia wants to express its \nposition on the historic turning point that the people of \nPalestine and the people of Israel are passing through \nand the challenges that they are facing. We are \nconvinced that no great wisdom is required to realize \nthat, at the end of the day, it is only through peaceful \nnegotiation and mutual accommodation that the two \nparties can reach the final destination.  \n In that regard, it is not enough that the right of \nthe Palestinians to a viable State of their own be \nacknowledged and be paid lip service. It is also \nnecessary that real, tangible and practical steps be \ntaken, and in good time, towards the realization of that \nobjective. That has not been done. No doubt, that is \npartly the explanation for where we are today and at \nthis moment. On the other hand, while it is self-\ndefeating, and also unjust, to use it as a pretext for \ndelaying the realization of the dreams of the people of \nPalestine, nonetheless, it is neither proper nor realistic \nto underestimate and belittle the security concerns of \nIsrael.  \n When the time comes for us to pronounce \nourselves on this signature issue of the sixty-sixth \nsession of the Assembly, the position we take will be \nbased on our objective assessment of all dimensions of \nthe issue in good faith and in line with what we believe \nis dictated by the cause of justice and sustainable \npeace. \n We are passing through a period not only of \nuncertainty, but also of great historic and momentous \nchange. The world that emerged from the Second \nWorld War is almost no more. Periods such as this need \nto be handled delicately. That is why it is so critical \nthat more attention be paid to the need for preventing \nconflicts and for mediation. We are pleased that the \nPresident Al-Nasser has made this one of his top \npriorities. We want to assure him that he can expect the \nfull cooperation of the IGAD countries.  \n Let me conclude by asking for the support of all \nMember States for the draft resolution that the IGAD \ncountries will be submitting requesting observer status \nfor IGAD at the United Nations."

        "file_text": "Europe presents to you a message of \ncooperation, support and partnership. I congratulate the \nnew President of the General Assembly, Ambassador \nAl-Nasser, of Qatar. We fully share, Mr. President, in \nyour commitment to mediation as the best way to \nachieve the peaceful settlement of conflicts. Your very \nfirst predecessor was Paul-Henri Spaak, a man who, in \nthe years after the war, played a decisive role in the \ncreation of a new and unique forum for cooperation \namong European States. At the very beginning, we \nwere six Western European nations. Today, we form a \nunion of 27 member States spanning an entire \ncontinent with 500 million inhabitants, and \npartnerships throughout the world. \n I am not the first President of the European \nCouncil to address the General Assembly to share the \nexperiences and vision of Europe. However, I am the \nfirst to discharge this duty who is not, at the same time, \nthe head of State or Government of his country; the \nfirst whose full-time position is to work for unity \namong our 27 countries. That institutional innovation \ngives our union greater continuity and coherence, \nincluding with respect to others leaders worldwide. I \ntherefore wish to thank the Assembly for recognizing \nthis innovation, by giving me an opportunity to speak. \n  \n \n11-50865 28 \n In the year since the previous session of the \nGeneral Assembly gathered here, the world has \nchanged. In some fields, it has changed for the better. \nThat is why I would like to speak, first of all, about our \nhope; secondly, about some of our worries; and thirdly \nand finally, about Europe\u2019s responsibility in the world. \n First, there is hope: Hope for the millions of men \nand women who recently climbed out of poverty \u2014 in \nAsia, in Latin America and fortunately more often in \nAfrica too. Emerging economies are becoming \nemerged societies. There is hope for the newest \nmember of this Assembly, the Republic of South \nSudan, since its transition to independence. Although \nconcerns about the fighting remain, we applaud the end \nto decades of civil war. \n There is now a new hope that is, for the most \npart, due to the will of the peoples in northern Africa \nand the Middle East to take the road of democracy. \nEven if the fighting is not over, we have seen the defeat \nof repression and of terrorism, and the victory of \nforward-looking change.  \n For Europe, the Arab Spring is one of the most \nmomentous political developments since the end of the \ncold war. We, Europeans, are linked closely with the \nArab world by the bonds of history and geography, and \nwe wish for this Spring to blossom. And that is why we \nsupport all steps towards democratic transformation \nand economic reform that benefit the people. We \nsupport those steps with financial resources, access to \nour markets, mobility among our countries and with \nassistance for state- and nation-building. Our aim is for \nthe young men and women in our southern \nneighbourhood to feel that they can build a future in \ntheir own countries; it is a hope for a better life. \n We have done more than that. When, earlier this \nyear, there was a risk of bloodbath in Benghazi, \nEuropean leaders, together with others, acted with \nswiftness and determination, diplomatically \u2014 here in \nNew York \u2014 and militarily. We could not allow the \nLibyan regime to take the lives of its own people. The \nprinciple of \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d was put into \naction \u2014 with perseverance and success. Now there is \na responsibility to assist the new Libya with the \npolitical transition, reconciliation and reconstruction of \na united country. The Transitional National Council, \ntoday in the Libya seat, is ready for that task. Europe \nwas, is, and will remain on the side of the Libyans. \n In my view, the Arab Spring has provided two \nimportant lessons. The first one is this: 10 years ago, \nalmost to the day, when the horrific terrorist attacks of \n9/11 were committed in this very city, many feared the \nstart of an era of religious hatred. That has not \nhappened. The people in the streets of Tunis, Cairo, \nBenghazi and across the Arab world aspire to dignity, \njobs, equal opportunities, social justice and democracy. \nWe witnessed neither extremism, nor the so-called \nclash of civilizations, but an episode in the fight for \nfreedom and justice. And those should remain the \noverriding objectives of the future. \n The second lesson is that a political system that \ndoes not allow for peaceful change will remain weak at \nheart. We praise, therefore, the leaders who are taking \ncourageous steps towards positive change. \n But alongside the hope, there is reason for worry, \ntoo \u2014 and that is my second point \u2014 about the brutal \nand ongoing repression by the Syrian regime against its \nown citizens. Europe is keeping the pressure on the \nregime with sanctions, and we urge others to join us. \n Of course, there are other worries too: worry \nabout the famine in Somalia, where thousands of \nchildren have died and many more are at risk, and \nwhere we must act decisively; worry about ongoing \nwars and conflicts; worry about the safety of nuclear \nreactors; worry about nuclear proliferation and the \nbehaviour of the Iranian and North Korean leadership; \nand worry about climate change. In each case, we have \nto ask ourselves, as the international community, \nwhether we are doing what we should be doing, both in \nthe short term \u2014 protecting human lives \u2014 and in the \nlonger term \u2014 preserving life for humankind. \n Faced with these realities of hope and worry in \nthe world, the European Union takes up its \nresponsibility, and that is my third point. We act, \nsupporting the forces of hope and fighting the causes of \nworry, and very concretely so.  \n We fight the causes of worry with means and \nmoney. The European Union is the world\u2019s largest \ndonor of development aid and a major donor of climate \nfinance for the poorest nations. \n We fight the causes of worry with manpower. We \nhave not only tens of thousands of development \nworkers, but also thousands of soldiers, policemen and \njudges in missions around the world, peacekeeping in \nAfrica\u2019s Great Lake region, training police in \n \n \n29 11-50865 \n \nAfghanistan and Iraq, patrolling off the coast of \nSomalia. \n We fight the causes of worry with a sense of the \nglobal common good. In the issues of global \ngovernance, Europe looks for solutions. We are \nconstructive in world trade negotiations, ambitious in \nclimate talks and forthcoming in the reform of the \ninternational financial institutions, recognizing the \nshift in global economic power. We simply cannot \naccept a stalemate, be it in Durban, Doha, Rio or \nCannes. \n We fight the causes of worry with expertise in \nmediation. We mediate in conflicts in our \nneighbourhood and beyond, drawing from our \nexperience of overcoming age-old rivalries. In the \nBalkans, we bring parties together, and, as a member of \nthe Quartet, we are fully engaged in finding a solution \nin the Middle East peace process. \n I would say a word on that issue. The parameters \nfor a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are well \nknown. The European Union has outlined these on \nnumerous occasions, including here at the United \nNations. There is no reason to repeat them. Now is the \ntime for politics, dialogue and negotiations. \nPopulations have lived in fear and suffering for too \nlong. \n The principle of a two-State solution was \nestablished more than 60 years ago. Only half of it has \nbeen implemented. The European Union\u2019s political \nposition on the Middle East peace process is well \nestablished; it includes a reference to the 1967 borders, \nwith territorial swaps acceptable to both parties. \nMoreover, the Union is fully supporting financially the \nState-building process of the Palestinian Authority. \n Now, the resumption of direct talks between \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority is the top priority. \nThe legitimate aspirations of both the Palestinian and \nthe Israeli peoples for peace, safety and statehood must \nbe fulfilled with an agreement that will lead to the \nexistence of two States living side by side in peace and \nsecurity, and therefore include Israel\u2019s legitimate \nsecurity needs and the Palestinians\u2019 desire to end the \noccupation. \n That is why I say to the leaders on both sides: \nThe time to act is now. There are political risks, but \nthey need to take them, just like some of their \npredecessors did, with a view to offering a better and \nsafer future to their communities. The status quo is no \noption. The winds of change across the entire region \nshould help them to get out of the impasses. I say to \nthe leaders on both sides: History is a severe judge of \nshort-sightedness. Over time, it only rewards political \ncourage and statesmanship. From the European \nexperience, we can tell them that a lasting compromise \nis grounded in mutual sacrifice and trust. \n In a few weeks, a woman somewhere will give \nbirth to a child, the 7-billionth human being on Earth. \nThe birth of a baby is the strongest sign of hope. But \non what planet will this child live? As things stand, we \ncannot be certain of saving the environment. Present \npatterns of production and consumption are \nunsustainable. Moreover, our actions to combat climate \nchange are insufficient and below the politically agreed \nobjectives. \n Clearly, more needs to be done to align words and \ndeeds, starting at the United Nations Climate Change \nConference to be held in Durban. Europe sticks to its \ncommitments. We are delivering on the emissions \ntargets, and we invite the rest of the industrialized \ncountries to join us. At the coming United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development, the world \nshould show its renewed commitment to sustainable \ndevelopment. Green growth must become the rallying \ncry in countries big and small, rich and poor. And as I \nsaid, Europe is ready to help the most vulnerable \nnations. \n Europe fulfils its responsibilities in the world and \nat home. We are now facing our most serious test in \nyears \u2014 the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. \nEuropean leaders are making decisions, individually \nand jointly, to bring this storm to an end. We are acting \nwith determination and in a spirit of solidarity. It \nrequires political courage and statesmanship. \n The responsibility that I sense around the table \nwith our 27 Presidents and Prime Ministers is not just \nrelated to the euro\u2019s weakest economies, or to the \neurozone alone. No, we feel a responsibility for the \nworld economy as such. Looking to the weeks and \nmonths ahead, the Assembly may be assured that we \nwill continue to do what it takes to safeguard the \nfinancial stability of the eurozone, working on more \ngovernance, more fiscal discipline and more fiscal \nintegration. It is the defining challenge for my \ngeneration. \n  \n \n11-50865 30 \n \n We are aware that people in other economies look \nto us, since our problems may affect their jobs, \npensions or savings. We likewise expect the other \nmajor economies to take responsibility for their \ninternal challenges. Each has to bring its own house in \norder, be it by bringing down its public debt, \nstimulating domestic demand or aligning exchange \nrates to economic fundamentals.\n Clearly, our agenda is much broader. Members \nmay rest assured that Europe will continue to stand \nshoulder to shoulder with the United Nations in order \nto build a world of peace and security, to promote the \nuniversal values of human rights and democracy, and \nto fight famine and poverty. In an increasingly \nglobalized world, the role of the United Nations is \ncrucial. Europe\u2019s 500 million citizens reject any \nturning inward or splendid isolation. Furthermore, the \nworld does not belong to any one nation. This world is \nour world, and it belongs to us all."

        "file_text": "For the very \nfirst time in the history of the United Nations, a female \nvoice is opening the general debate. It is the voice of \ndemocracy and equality that reverberates from a forum \nthat is committed to being the most representative in \nthe world. It is with a sense of personal humility, but \nwith justifiable pride as a woman, that I greet this \nhistoric moment.  \n I share this emotion with more than half of the \nhuman beings on this planet, who, like me, were born \nwomen and who, with a sense of purposeful \ndetermination, are now taking the place in the world \nthey rightly deserve. I am certain that this will be the \ncentury of women. In the Portuguese language, words \nsuch as life, soul and hope are feminine nouns. Two \nother words in Portuguese that are especially dear to \nme are also feminine, namely, courage and sincerity. \nAnd it is in a spirit of courage and sincerity that I wish \nto address the General Assembly today.  \n The world is experiencing an extremely delicate \nperiod, one that at the same time offers us a major \nhistoric opportunity. We face an economic crisis that, if \nnot overcome, could become a source of serious \npolitical and social disruption, an unprecedented \nupheaval capable of causing serious imbalances in \nrelationships between people and nations. More than \never before, the fate of the world is in the hands of its \nrulers and leaders, with no exceptions. Either we \ncombine our efforts and emerge victorious together, or \nwe will all emerge defeated. It is now less important to \nknow or decide who caused the situation we are \nfacing \u2014 because, after all, that is clear enough by \nnow. What does matter is that we start finding \ncollective, speedy and genuine solutions. \n The current crisis is too serious to be managed by \na few countries. Their Governments and central banks \nstill have the greatest responsibility in implementing \nthe process. Yet, since all countries suffer the \nconsequences, all are entitled to participate in their \nsolutions. It is not because of a lack of financial \nresources that the leaders of developed countries have \nnot yet found a solution to the crisis. Rather, if I may \nput it this way, it is due to a lack of political resources \nand, at times, of clear ideas. There is a part of the \nworld that has not yet found a balance between \nappropriate fiscal adjustments and correct and precise \nfiscal stimuli conducive to demand and growth. They \nhave been caught in a trap that does not distinguish \nbetween partisan interests and the legitimate interests \nof society. The challenge posed by the crisis entails \nreplacing outdated theories that belong to an old world \nwith new proposals crafted for a new world. \n While many Governments are shrinking, \nunemployment, the bitterest face of the crisis, is \ngrowing. There are already 205 million unemployed \npeople in the world, of whom 44 million are in Europe \nand 14 million in the United States. Tackling this \nscourge and preventing it from spreading to other \nregions of the planet is vitally important. We women \nknow better than anyone that unemployment is not just \na statistic; it affects our families, children and \n \n \n7 11-50692 \n \nhusbands. It takes away hope and leaves a trail of \nviolence and pain. \n It is quite telling that it is the President of an \nemerging country, a country experiencing almost full \nemployment, who has come here today to speak in such \nstark terms of a tragedy that has mainly hit developed \ncountries. \n Like other emerging countries, Brazil has thus far \nbeen less affected by the global crisis. But we know \nthat our ability to withstand the crisis is not unlimited. \nWe are willing and able to help those countries that are \nalready facing an acute crisis, while there is still time. \nA new kind of cooperation between emerging and \ndeveloped countries is an historic opportunity to \nredefine, with solidarity and responsibility, the \ncommitments that govern international relations. \n The world of today faces a crisis that is at once of \neconomics, governance and political coordination. \nThere will not be a return to confidence and growth \nuntil we intensity coordination efforts among United \nNations Member States and other multilateral \ninstitutions, including the Group of Twenty, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and \nother organs.  \n The United Nations and those organizations must \nact urgently to send clear signals of political cohesion \nand macroeconomic coordination. For example, fiscal \nand monetary policies should be submitted to mutual \nassessment in such a way as to ultimately prevent \nundesirable effects on other countries, thus avoiding \ndefensive reactions that in turn lead to a vicious circle.  \n The solution to the debt problem should be \ncombined with economic growth. There are obvious \nsigns that several advanced economies are on the \nthreshold of recession, which will significantly hamper \nresolution of their fiscal problems. \n It is clear that the priority for the world economy \nat this moment should be to solve the problems of \nthose countries that are facing a sovereign debt crisis \nand reversing the current recession scenario. The most \ndeveloped countries must establish coordinated \npolicies to stimulate economies that have been \nextremely weakened by the crisis. Countries with \nemerging economies can help in that effort. Countries \nwith a high surplus should strengthen their domestic \nmarkets and, as appropriate, make their foreign \nexchange rate policies more flexible in such a way that \ncontributes to the eventual rebalancing of global \ndemand.  \n Deepening the regulation of the financial system \nand controlling that inexhaustible source of instability \nis a pressing need. Controls must be imposed on the \nforeign-exchange war by adopting floating foreign-\nexchange regimes. The task at hand is about preventing \nthe manipulation of foreign exchange that occurs not \nonly through excessively expansionist monetary \npolicies but also through an artificially fixed foreign \nexchange.  \n Without a doubt, the reform of multilateral \nfinancial institutions should continue, thus increasing \nthe participation of emerging countries, which, as \ndriving forces, are responsible for the growth of the \nworld\u2019s economy. We should fight protectionism and \nall forms of commercial manipulation. They do \nincrease competitiveness, but in a spurious, fraudulent \nfashion. \n Brazil is doing its homework. With sacrifices, but \nat the same time with a sense of insightfulness, we \nhave kept Government spending under strict control, to \nthe point of generating a sizable surplus in Government \naccounts while ensuring that those steps will not \ncompromise the success of our social policies or the \npace of our investment and growth. We are also taking \nadditional precautions to buttress our ability to \nwithstand the crisis by strengthening our domestic \nmarket with income distribution and technological \ninnovation policies. \n For at least three years now, Brazil has reiterated \u2014 \ntime and again, from this very podium \u2014 that we must \nall tackle the causes, and not only the consequences, of \nglobal instability. We have emphasized time and again \nthe interrelations among development, peace and \nsecurity. We have often underscored that development \npolicies should be increasingly coupled with the \nSecurity Council\u2019s strategies in the pursuit of \nsustainable peace.  \n That is how we have acted as part of our \ncommitments to Haiti and to Guinea-Bissau. As a \nleading country in the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti, Brazil has since 2004 undertaken \nhumanitarian projects that integrate security and \ndevelopment. With deep respect for Haitian \nsovereignty, Brazil is proud to assist in the \nconsolidation of democracy in that country. \n  \n \n11-50692 8 \n \n We are in a position to provide a solidarity-based \ncontribution to brotherly countries in the developing \nworld in matters such as food security, agricultural \ntechnology, generation of clean and renewable energy \nand the fight against hunger and poverty. \n Since late 2010, we have witnessed a series of \ngrass-roots demonstrations that have come to be known \nas the Arab Spring. Brazil is the adopted homeland of \nmany immigrants from that part of the world. \nBrazilians sympathize with the pursuit of an ideal that \nbelongs to no culture in particular, because it is by \ndefinition universal: freedom. \n The nations united here today must find a \nlegitimate and effective way to aid those societies that \ncry out for reform \u2014 without, however, depriving their \ncitizens of a lead role in the process. We strongly \nrepudiate the brutal crack down episodes that victimize \ncivilian populations. We remain convinced that for the \ninternational community, resort to force must always \nbe the last alternative.  \n The quest for peace and security in the world \ncannot be limited to interventions in extreme situations \nonly. We support the Secretary-General in his efforts to \nengage the United Nations in conflict prevention by \ntirelessly exercising diplomacy and promoting \ndevelopment. The world of today suffers from the \npainful consequences of interventions that have \nworsened existing conflicts. That has allowed terrorism \nto creep into areas where it previously did not exist, \nthus generating new cycles of violence and multiplying \nthe number of civilian victims. \n Much is said about the responsibility to protect, \nyet little is said about responsibility while protecting. \nThese are concepts that we must develop and mature \ntogether. To that end, the role of the Security Council is \ncritical, and the more legitimate its decisions are, the \nmore appropriate that role will be. And the Council\u2019s \nvery legitimacy increasingly depends upon its reform.  \n With each passing year, a solution to the lack of \nrepresentativeness in the Security Council becomes an \never more urgent need, which in turn erodes its \nefficacy. Former Assembly President Joseph Deiss \nreminded me of an impressive fact, namely, that the \ndebate on the proposed reform of the Security Council \nis now entering its eighteenth year.  \n We can delay no longer. The world needs a \nSecurity Council that reflects contemporary realities, a \nCouncil that will incorporate new permanent and \nnon-permanent members, especially those representing \ndeveloping countries. \n Brazil is ready to take on its responsibilities as a \npermanent member of the Council. We have lived in \npeace with our neighbours for more than 140 years and \nhave fostered successful integration and cooperation \nprocesses with them. Our Constitution expressly states \nour commitment to abstain from the use of nuclear \nenergy for non-peaceful purposes. I am proud to say \nthat Brazil is a driver of peace, stability and prosperity \nin the region and even beyond it. \n In the Human Rights Council, we have drawn \ninspiration from our own history of endeavour as a \nnation. We desire for other countries what we desire for \nourselves. Authoritarianism, xenophobia, poverty, \ncapital punishment and discrimination are all sources \nof human rights violations. We know that violations \noccur in every country, without exception. We must \nrecognize this reality, and we must accept criticism. We \nwill ultimately benefit from criticism, and we should \npointedly criticize flagrant violations wherever they \noccur. \n I welcome South Sudan to our family of nations. \nBrazil is ready to cooperate with the youngest Member \nof the United Nations and to contribute to its sovereign \ndevelopment.  \n I regret, however, that from this podium I am still \nunable to welcome Palestine into full membership of \nthe Organization. Brazil has recognized the Palestinian \nState as defined by the 1967 borders, in accordance \nwith United Nations resolutions. Like most countries in \nthe Assembly, we believe that the time has come for \nPalestine to be represented as a full Member in this \nforum. \n The recognition of the Palestinian people\u2019s \nlegitimate right to sovereignty and self-rule expands \nthe possibilities and prospects for a lasting peace in the \nMiddle East. Only a free and sovereign Palestine can \nrespond to Israel\u2019s legitimate desire for peace with its \nneighbours, security within its borders and political \nstability in its region. I come from a country where \ndescendents of Arabs and Jews are compatriots and live \ntogether in harmony, which is as it should be. \n Brazil advocates for a global, comprehensive and \nambitious agreement within the framework of the \nUnited Nations to fight climate change. To achieve \n \n \n9 11-50692 \n \nthis, countries must shoulder their respective \nresponsibilities. Brazil submitted a concrete, voluntary \nand significant proposal for reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions during the 2009 United Nations Climate \nChange Conference in Copenhagen. We hope to be able \nto make progress at the upcoming meeting in Durban \nby supporting developing countries in their efforts to \nreduce emissions, and at the same time ensuring that \ndeveloped countries fulfil their obligations, beyond \n2012, on the basis of new targets under the Kyoto \nProtocol.  \n Brazil will have the honour of hosting the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \u2014 \nRio+20 \u2014 in June of 2012. Along with Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, I reiterate our invitation to all \nheads of State and Government to join us at that \nConference next year. \n Brazil has learned that fighting poverty is the best \ndevelopment policy, and that a genuine human rights \npolicy must ultimately be based on reducing \ninequalities and discrimination between and among \nregions, people and genders. Brazil has made political, \neconomic and social progress without compromising \nany of its democratic freedoms. We have met almost all \nof the Millennium Development Goals before 2015. \nForty million Brazilian men and women have come up \nout of poverty and been lifted into the middle class. I \nam fully confident that we will achieve our goal of \neradicating extreme poverty in Brazil by the end of my \nterm in office. \n In my country, women have been vital to the task \nof overcoming social inequalities. Our income \ndistribution programmes place mothers as the central \nfigures in the scheme. It is they who manage the \nresources that allow families to invest in the health and \neducation of their children. Yet my country, like every \nother nation, still has to do much more when it comes \nto valuing women and asserting their status. In that \nregard, I would like to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral for making women a priority during his tenure \nat the head of the United Nations. I particularly \nwelcome the creation of UN-Women and the \nappointment of its Executive Director, Ms. Michelle \nBachelet. \n Besides speaking on behalf of my own beloved \ncountry, I feel that when I stand up here I am \nrepresenting all the women of the world \u2014 the \nanonymous women, those who starve and cannot feed \ntheir children, those who are suffering from illnesses \nand cannot get treatment, those who are victims of \nviolence or who are discriminated against at work, in \nsociety and in their family life, and those who labour at \nhome to bring up future generations. I add my voice to \nthose of the women who have dared to struggle, to take \npart in political and professional life, and who have \nthus gained the spheres of power that allow me to stand \nhere today. \n As a woman who was the victim of torture while \nin prison, I am all too aware of how important values \nsuch as democracy, justice, human rights and freedom \nare to all of us. It is my hope that these values will \ncontinue to inspire the work of this house of nations, \nwhere I am honoured to open the general debate of the \nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, allow me to thank most sincerely the \nAmbassador of sisterly Qatar on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I should like also to thank Secretary-General \nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to a second \nterm as Secretary-General. \n I stand before the Assembly today feeling sadness \nand awe at the loss of the more than 30,000 martyrs \nwho sacrificed their lives for my country. Their sacred \nblood was shed to write a new history for the new \nLibya. By the same token, I bow before the mothers \nwho now know that their sons\u2019 sacrifice was just and \nrightful. Had the same events been repeated, mothers, \nfathers, sons and daughters would have done the same, \n \n \n47 11-51360 \n \nin order to write the new history. From this rostrum, let \nme salute all the martyrs whose blood was shed, and all \nthe mothers and fathers in Libya. I also salute the \nthousands of wounded in hospitals both inside and \noutside Libya. \n Two years ago, in this very Hall and on this very \nspot, Muammar Al-Qadhafi stood before the Assembly \nand tore up the Charter of the United Nations. That was \na pathetic, theatrical move that disdainfully flouted \ninternational values. Even though we might have some \nreservations about the rules that govern the work of \ninternational organizations, they should not be judged \nin such a manner or treated in such a theatrical way, \nwhich is harmful to the people of Libya, to the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, to the \nPresident of the General Assembly and indeed to the \nentire Organization.  \n I stand before the Assembly today to show the \nworld that a new Libya is being born, a Libya that \nlooks ahead with a vision of development and self-\nrealization, a Libya that wants to heal its wounds, \novercome its pain and reach out to the entire world. \nThis new Libya wants to rebuild and to reform its \nhistory. \n The vision of the new Libya is that of a civil, \ndemocratic State governed by a clear, unambiguous \nconstitution that sets forth rights and obligations, that \ndoes not discriminate between male and female, one \nfaction and another, one political belief and another, \nbetween east and west, nor along racial or ethnic lines.  \n All Libyans are the sons and daughters of this \nnation, a nation that is now determined to heal its \nwounds and move on after 42 years away from the \ninternational community. It seeks to be an active party, \nlike other countries of the world, one that can \ncontribute to a human civilization. \n We do not claim to have a magic wand, as \nMuammar Al-Qadhafi did when he looked at himself in \nthe mirror and suddenly discovered that he was an \nalmighty prophet with a solution to every problem on \nEarth, except for Libya\u2019s. \n After 42 years, one fifth of Libya\u2019s people live in \npoverty, and the country\u2019s educational and health \nsystems and services are the worst in the region. \nInfrastructure is falling to pieces, and youth \nunemployment is over 30 per cent. Those are the \nsolutions bequeathed to us by Muammar Al-Qadhafi. \nLibya is witness to that. \n The new Libya of which I speak did not arise \nfrom a vacuum. It has been watered by the blood shed \nsince 17 February of this year, when Libyan youth \ndecided to turn a new page in Libyan history. The \nentire Libyan people \u2014 young and old, women and \nchildren \u2014 paid the ultimate price. All the sons and \ndaughters of Libya have written this page. No one can \nclaim to lead this revolution or own it; only the Libyan \npeople can claim that. \n In the very first week of March of this year, a \nparallel action was launched alongside the act of \nrevolutionary youth in all cities of Libya. A group of \npeople, including myself, was working day and night to \nprovide political support and to interpret the just cause \nof the Libyan people on Libyan soil, to interpret the \nprevailing oppression and dictatorship and the lack of \nany development for the past 42 years. Friendly, \nsisterly countries responded to that call. They reached \nout to the hands that had reached out to them. The \nworld helped us to shed injustice. \n On behalf of the Libyan people, I wish here to \nthank all friendly States, all sisterly States and all \nregional organizations. I wish to thank in particular the \nUnited Nations for Security Council resolutions 1970 \n(2011) and 1973 (2011), which were a determining \nfactor in eliminating injustice and protecting civilians \nand preventing any further massacres in my country. \n On the basis of such continuous diplomatic \nefforts, I can say today that that mission has been \naccomplished. Now we have a new mission. Let us \nmake another attempt. Let us reach out to those who \nneed technical assistance. Let all funds be unfrozen so \nthat, having freed themselves from tyranny, the Libyan \npeople can now rebuild. \n Libya today is at the crossroads of realities on the \nground, expectations and rightful dues. The facts can \nbe summarized quite briefly. The land is not yet fully \nliberated. There are still some fronts to be liberated. It \nis our right within Libya to liberate our own land, and \nwe hope to do just that sometime soon. \n Our infrastructure has been destroyed. There are \nmany wounded and martyred in all Libyan cities. More \nthan 63 schools have been destroyed. There are more \nthan 50,000 injured. Amputees number more than \n1,700. They await help and succour so that they can \n  \n \n11-51360 48 \n \nonce again effectively contribute to rebuilding their \ncountry. \n The social fabric needs healing, having been torn \nby Al-Qadhafi. He tried to turn some tribes and \ncommunities against each other and some regions \nagainst others.  \n The economy is broken down. Oil sits, needing to \npumped and exported. Although production is being \nresumed, we believe that more assistance is required in \nthat regard.  \n Funds and assets have been frozen. The \nannounced lifting of the freeze certainly does not rise \nto the level of what is required in order to enable \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of the country. State \ninstitutions need to be re-established and rebuilt, \nparticularly because the country has been deprived of \nany real institutions for over 42 years. Libya is a State \nthat had no law or institutions. Social and political \ndemands are jostling each other, not just in terms of \nparticipation but also of setting priorities.  \n First and foremost, we must agree on the rules \nand principles of participation. In addition, as the \nAssembly knows, there are many expectations, from \nour people within and from members of the \ninternational community without. As the Assembly \nconsiders how soon the transitional period will begin \nand how the transitional Government will be created, it \nis calling for respect for human rights and for respect \nfor foreign workers, asking that we deal with them in \naccordance with international norms. The Assembly \ncalls for us to include everyone, without exclusion, to \nbuild institutions at the required speed, to achieve \nnational reconciliation and end the arming and \nmilitarization of our streets and towns, and to maintain \nthe unity of the homeland. The international \ncommunity is also asking us to include it in \nreconstruction.  \n That is a great deal by any standard. \nNevertheless, a people that was able to bring down its \nregime and face political initiatives from all sides \ncould not accept that its situation was at a standstill. \nThe Transitional National Council has always rejected \ncompromise solutions. Through their will, the Libyan \nyouth and Libyan people proved that those calculations \nwere wrong, proving that they can win the battle and \nface all the challenges, despite all the doubts and \nproblems that I just mentioned. \n National unity without a unified land or without \nnational reconciliation is an illusion. Achieving \nsecurity and national reconciliation are urgent \nimperatives for any Government, whether interim or \ntransitional. No political participation is possible \nwithout rules, rights and obligations. Therefore, it is of \nthe utmost importance to put a draft constitution to the \nLibyan people for referendum. We want the rules of \npolitical participation to be fair and to govern the \ndialogue and competition, giving rights to all, without \nexcluding any individual or group.  \n The assets freeze on our funds must be fully \nlifted as soon as possible. Let me appeal to the \nAssembly from this rostrum and to the Security \nCouncil to adopt the historic resolution to lift the \nfreeze soon. The regime has fallen, even though we \nhave not yet liberated the entire homeland.  \n We seek the help of the United Nations, the \nunconditional help of friendly and sisterly countries. \nWe believe it to be a legitimate and undeniable right of \nall States to enjoy sovereignty, whatever the nature or \nsize of assistance that is sought and needed.  \n The Libya that we want is a State of law, an oasis \nfor human development in the Middle East. We believe \nthat Libya, through geography, history and its \ngeostrategic importance in the world, is a cultural link \nbetween North, South, East and West. Libya must \nresume that role, a role that has been denied to it for \nmore than 40 years now.  \n I believe that development solutions that Libya \nmay propose could help find unprecedented solutions \nto the phenomenon of illegal migration from the \nsouthern part of the African continent to Europe. We \nbelieve that the twenty-first century will be ruled to a \nlarge extent by demography, and we believe that Africa \nhas the greatest capacities in terms of geography and \nhuman resources. We believe that hundreds of millions \nof young Africans will be driven by poverty and \nunemployment to move northward. Libya can be the \ngateway to development, instead of being the obstacle \nto migration from South to North.  \n African labour, skills and competencies that \nsatisfy the needs of the European economies can \ncontribute to European economic growth, particularly \nin the light of the fact that in the next 30 years Europe \nwill be facing a much smaller, ageing population. In \n2050, the population of Europe will have diminished \nby 72 million; Africa\u2019s population will be nearly \n \n \n49 11-51360 \n \n2 billion. We believe that all this can contribute to \nEuropean economic well-being and development \nthrough an agreement between Libyan capital and \nEuropean technology. \n On the political front, Libya must be a civilian \ndemocratic State that gives full opportunities and \nparticipation to all its sons and daughters. Women must \nhave a major role in the reconstruction of such a State. \nWomen in Libya, about 50 per cent of the population, \nenjoy a very high level of education, because many \ncontinue their education beyond high school. We \nbelieve that women have a genuine role to play in \nrebuilding and developing Libya.  \n As for foreign policy, we need a vision that \nradically reviews Muammar Al-Qadhafi\u2019s foreign \npolicy, which was designed to sow fear, terrorism and \nblackmail in many regions of the world. Rare is the \nregion of the world that escaped suffering from \nMuammar Al-Qadhafi\u2019s practices and plots to \ndestabilize them through terrorism. Our new foreign \npolicy must be based on mutual respect and respect for \nmutual interests, and on non-intervention in the \ninternal affairs of others, just as we do not accept that \nothers intervene in our affairs. International \ninstruments, conventions, treaties, norms, values and \nethical principles must be respected. These are the \nterms of reference for all relationships today. \n Rebuilding Libya into a civilian democratic State \nis an important matter, not only for Libya but, in our \nview, for the entire region as well. Libya is capable of \nbecoming, and has the opportunity to become, a model \nof democracy and successful development. The \nnegative effects of the separation of a country\u2019s politics \nfrom its economy have brought many problems and \ndifficulties to this region. \n The time has come for a vision of development \nthat puts young people and women at the very top of its \nlist of priorities \u2014 not just because they make up \n67 per cent of the population of the Arab world, but \nbecause the future belongs to them. It is they who \nstarted and led this revolution and the other revolutions \nof the Arab Spring. We therefore need a new vision that \nresponds to the dreams of youth, a vision that the \ninternational community must support; otherwise, the \nregion will only be subjected to successive waves of \ninstability. \n Supporting Libya in this development paradigm \nis no less important and critical than protecting \ninnocent civilians. The international community, whom \nwe thank, did this in implementing Security Council \nresolution 1973 (2011). In this context, we are \nproposing a clear initiative, which could be termed \n\u201cbuilding the new Libya\u201d, to which our brothers and \nfriends contribute. However, the United Nations must \nplay a pioneering and leading role here, one through \nwhich its specialized development agencies can \nprovide expertise and technical assistance. We must \ngive those agencies precedence over private companies \nin order to avoid any possibility of corruption or lack \nof transparency and fairness.\n We believe that roads are made by the feet that \nwalk on them. The Libyan people have now begun \ntheir march towards rewriting their history. We have \ngreat hopes in this international Organization, which \nhas travelled hand in hand with us. It was a \ntrustworthy, reliable friend \u2014 as was, indeed, the \nentire international community \u2014 and prevented an \nimminent massacre in my country by intervening at the \nright time to save civilians. That makes a reality of the \nArab League\u2019s call for an intervention, and we thank \nthe League for that. Just as the United Nations was a \nfaithful friend at that time, we believe it can now be a \ntrusted and supportive partner in the rebuilding of my \ncountry. This is the major battle, for which we appeal \nto the Assembly for assistance \u2014 political, economic, \nfinancial and technical."

        "file_text": "It is an honour and a \nprivilege to address the General Assembly once again \non behalf of the people of Palau. \n For thousands of years, Palau was blessed by a \nnatural bounty that sustained our livelihood and bound \nus together as a people. We lived in remoteness and \nisolation by respecting the environment and managing \nour natural resources for the benefit of every \ngeneration. \n Today, however, we find ourselves to be innocent \nvictims of transboundary harm. Forces beyond Palau\u2019s \ncontrol, and not of our own making, are ravaging the \noceans, damaging the land and reefs, threatening our \nway of life and, in the worst-case scenario, our very \nexistence. Although we do our best to act responsibly \nand sustainably, there is only so much my country can \ndo on its own to protect itself. We therefore rely on our \npartners, the international system and on the \ninternational rule of law to provide a remedy. \n I would like to speak today about three pernicious \ntypes of transboundary harm.  \n First, I point to the state of global fisheries. \nPalau\u2019s fish are among the most valuable in the world, \nbut they are in danger. Distant water boats do not \nrespect our borders, laws or traditions. These boats \ncome in great numbers for tuna in the Western and \nCentral Pacific region, where Palau is located. At \npresent, our region\u2019s tuna is being taken for pennies on \nthe dollar. These boats also hunt, fin and sell sharks for \na tiny fraction of what tourists will pay to see those \nsharks alive in our waters. \n Like the ocean\u2019s currents, efforts to protect the \nmarine environment must flow across boundary lines. \nIt takes international cooperation to protect our marine \nresources and environment. \n Palau and other Pacific small island developing \nStates have undertaken innovative measures to ensure \nthe continued viability of our stocks. We have limited \npurse seine fishing, agreed to close the \u201cdonut holes\u201d \nbetween our jurisdictions and implemented a Vessel \nDay Scheme. \n \n \n27 11-50871 \n \n Two years ago, from this very rostrum, I \nannounced the creation of the world\u2019s first shark \nsanctuary. Since that time, countries and territories \nacross the globe have joined Palau in this effort. Today, \nmore than 2.7 million square kilometres of ocean are \nsafe for sharks. Our ocean\u2019s health depends on sharks, \nso I am delighted that earlier today several \nrepresentatives of States in different parts of the world \njoined me to declare our shared commitment to \nconserving the ocean\u2019s vast biodiversity and nurturing \nand protecting shark sanctuaries. But that is just the \nfirst step. \n Global fisheries should be sustainable. Reckless \npractices that harm our fisheries and threaten our food \nsecurity should stop. That means that shark finning \nshould stop. Bottom trawling, which destroys the base \nof the marine food web, should also stop. \n The Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations reports that 85 per cent of global fish \nstocks are now fully or overexploited. These are the \nworst numbers on record. The international community \nmust find a way to make regional fisheries \nmanagement organizations more accountable, so that \nthe world can see whether countries are living up to \ntheir commitments. And global fisheries should be fair. \nIf distant water vessels want to come to fish for our \nresources, they must respect our laws and those of our \nregion. They should fish within our prescribed limits \nand share the mutual benefits with us in a fair and \nequitable manner. \n Fishing is not a right. It is a privilege. For too \nlong, the exploitation of tuna has overridden efforts to \nconserve it. This imbalance is not sustainable and must \nbe reversed. This should be done by creating a tuna \nconservation zone to make the conservation of this \nvaluable resource paramount and to maximize the \nbenefits to the nations in our region where tuna is \nharvested. We who live in the Pacific see the ocean as \nour farm, the source of our sustenance and livelihood. \nAt the biggest-ever Pacific Tuna Conference, to be held \nin Palau in early December, that concept of a tuna \nconservation zone will be considered and applied to \nour region of the world. We should continue our efforts \nto maximize the benefits to our islands of sustainable \ntuna fishing in our waters. \n Secondly, we fear that this year undetectable \namounts of nuclear radiation may have entered our \nterritory. This is a particularly insidious form of \ntransboundary harm. I was involved in writing Palau\u2019s \nConstitution, which bans the presence of any nuclear \nmaterial in our territory. We are proud to have been the \nfirst in the world to institute such a prohibition. But the \nsupreme law of our land cannot protect us from \npotential radiation coming from outside our borders. \nWe fear the possibility that someday our fish may not \nbe safe to eat and our water may not be safe to drink. \nAnd so we ask the world to redouble its efforts to \neliminate the threat of nuclear radiation. \n Thirdly, as I speak, people are suffering from the \neffects of climate change. As our corals die, shores \nerode and waters rise, people feel helpless and \nhopeless. Traditionally, we would appeal for divine \nintervention. But this is not a problem from above; it is \nmanmade. It poses an existential threat that exemplifies \nthe issue of transboundary harm. Today, I regret to say \nthat we are nowhere close to a solution. Next year will \nmark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. But have we made progress? While sea levels \nhave risen, emissions continue unabated. We are still \nwithout a binding agreement. \n This past July, the Pacific small island developing \nStates banded together to put before the Security \nCouncil modest, achievable and prudent proposals for \naddressing the security threats of climate change. But \nour voices were drowned out by other States\u2019 priorities. \nI can only agree with the views expressed in the \nCouncil by the United States: the failure of some States \nto acknowledge the clear-cut security implications of \nclimate change is pathetic. \n However, we will not be deterred. Leaders of the \nPacific States have declared that the urgent social, \neconomic and security threats posed by climate change \nrequire action in every international forum. The \nGeneral Assembly, in its consensus resolution 63/281, \ninvited the relevant bodies of the United Nations to \nintensify their efforts in considering and addressing \nclimate change, including its possible security \nimplications.  \n With this in mind, Palau and the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands will call on the Assembly to seek, on \nan urgent basis and pursuant to Article 96 of the \nCharter of the United Nations, an advisory opinion \nfrom the International Court of Justice on the \nresponsibilities of States under international law to \nensure that activities emitting greenhouse gases that \n  \n \n11-50871 28 \n \nare carried out under their jurisdiction or control do not \ndamage other States. \n The case should be clear. The International Court \nof Justice has already confirmed that customary \ninternational law obliges States to ensure that activities \nwithin their jurisdiction or under their control respect \nthe environment of other States. Similarly, Article 194, \nparagraph 2, of the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea provides that States shall take all \nmeasures necessary to ensure that activities under their \njurisdiction or control do not spread or cause damage \nby pollution to other States. It is time we determined \nwhat the international rule of law means in the context \nof climate change. The International Court of Justice is \nmandated to do just that. \n At the opening of last year\u2019s General Assembly, \nHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated \nthat \u201cAt the United Nations, we find the proper path in \ncommunity, global cause \u2026 and mutual responsibility \nfor a destiny we share\u201d (A/65/PV.11, p. 1). That \nsentiment means, first and foremost, that countries \nmust do no harm, particularly to the most fragile \namong us. We should find guidance in the international \nrule of law. Nations must respect fellow nations. \nWhether the issue is destructive fishing practices, \nnuclear radiation or excessive emissions, nations must \nwork together and cease to cause transboundary harm. \n I would like to share with the Assembly a number \nof important initiatives that Palau is undertaking to \nconnect with the international community, literally and \nin spirit.  \n Palau is currently connected to the Internet by \nsatellite. However, the service is poor and the cost \nunaffordable for most of our people. Last year\u2019s report \nof the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s \nBroadband Commission confirms that broadband \naccess is a prerequisite to achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. According to the report, a 10 per \ncent increase in broadband penetration in developing \ncountries increases GDP by 1.4 per cent. Imagine what \na 100 per cent increase could do. \n In light of that report, I have signed Executive \nOrder No. 297 establishing a presidential task force to \nacquire a submarine fibre optic cable so that Palau will \nbe better equipped to meet its Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. I hope that others will cooperate \nto help Palau connect to the world, and that leaders \nwill answer the Commission\u2019s clarion call to ensure \nthat all people have access to broadband networks by \n2015. \n Palau is also reaching out to the world on human \nrights. In February, we began our Human Rights \nCouncil Universal Periodic Review. As a former \npracticing attorney and human rights advocate, I have \nbeen an ardent supporter of this process from the \noutset, and so I have committed Palau\u2019s limited \nresources to ensuring a complete and meaningful \noutcome. As evidence of that commitment, I \nestablished a task force chaired by our Minister of \nState and comprised of officials from across a broad \nspectrum of our Government. Stakeholders from \nnon-governmental organizations and civil society were \nalso invited to become involved in the operations of the \ntask force and contributed significantly to Palau\u2019s \nnational report. \n By all accounts, Palau\u2019s response was a great \nsuccess. The Human Rights Council unanimously \nadopted our report. The most repeated recommendation \nfrom Human Rights Council members was that Palau \nshould establish a National Human Rights Institution. I \nhave taken this recommendation to heart and am \npleased to announce that Palau will establish a \nNational Human Rights Institution. I am also pleased \nto announce that, as of this week, Palau is now a \nsignatory to all core international human rights \nconventions. I hope others will assist Palau as we build \nour institution and work to fulfil our obligations under \nthose conventions. \n Once again, I wish to bring to the world\u2019s \nattention the fact that the fierce battles fought by \nforeign armies over Palau\u2019s islands during the Second \nWorld War left explosives scattered across our land and \nin our waters. Some of those explosives, which number \nin the thousands, are still live. I appeal to the \nconscience of the world and, especially, of those \nresponsible, to help us remove this danger from our \nmidst. \n I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \nattending the recent meeting of the Pacific Islands \nForum, held earlier this month in Auckland, New \nZealand. That meeting was the Forum\u2019s fortieth \nanniversary and was the first time that a United \nNations Secretary-General has attended our regional \nmeeting and the first time that a United Nations \nSecretary-General has visited a Pacific small island \ndeveloping State. I would like to thank His Excellency \n \n \n29 11-50871 \n \nMr. Ban Ki-moon for his visit. It is a testament to the \nfact that the countries of our region, even the smallest \nand most vulnerable among us, have something \nimportant to say and to contribute to our world. \n I would also like to express Palau\u2019s gratitude for \nthe strong support and friendship of all of our partners, \nnew and old. In particular, I would like to thank the \nUnited States of America, Japan and the Taiwan \nprovince of China. \n In order to further promote the efficacy, goals and \nideals of the United Nations, we recommend that \nTaiwan be invited to participate meaningfully in the \nUnited Nations system. I believe that the United \nNations cannot fully and properly address the issues of \nhealth, aviation safety and climate change unless \nTaiwan is allowed to participate in the activities of the \nWorld Health Organization, the International Civil \nAviation Organization and the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. Once \nagain, I appeal to the world to allow Taiwan to \nparticipate in these important United Nations entities. \n Finally, Palau is a relatively new State, having \njoined the world community in 1994. Thus, we \nremember well the jubilation of our new-found \nfreedom and independence. I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the people of South Sudan on attaining \ntheir independence and taking their rightful place here, \nin United Nations."

        "file_text": "I extend my \nwarm and respectful greetings to all, and hope that the \nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly will yield \nfruitful results. I would like to congratulate Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the \npresidency, and extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. \nJoseph Deiss for his service as the previous President \nof the Assembly. \n We are at a moment when both the international \ncommunity and the United Nations are being tested in \nan unprecedented manner. I feel obliged, however, to \nstate very frankly that today the United Nations is not \ndemonstrating the leadership necessary to help \nhumankind overcome its fears of the future. The United \nNations must therefore reform itself and renew its \nvision with a view to protecting the universal rights of \nhumankind as a whole, rather than act in the interest \nand remain under the guardianship of certain countries. \n Last month in Somalia, for instance, I personally \nwitnessed how the United Nations and the international \ncommunity remain helpless in the face of today\u2019s \npressing problems. It is impossible for me to put into \nwords the poverty and suffering I saw in Somalia. I am \nspeaking of this because I have personally witnessed it, \nwith my family and ministers. It is not hearsay; I have \nseen it myself. The tragedy of Somalia, where tens of \nthousands of children have died for the lack of a mere \npiece of bread and drop of water, is a matter of shame \nfor the international community and cannot be \ndismissed in a few words. The civil war that has gone \non for the past 20 years has wiped out all of Somalia\u2019s \nresources and livelihood. The Somali people are being \ngradually dragged to their death as the world looks on. \n The international community is watching the \nsuffering in Somalia as if it were a movie. It is urgent, \nhowever, that we face this situation, which is a test of \nour humanity. In doing so, we should not only look at \nthe picture we see today, but also at the shameful \nhistory that has led Somalia into this great tragedy. \nIndeed, beneath the tip of this huge iceberg lie great \ncrimes against humanity. \n In that respect, the situation in Somalia has also \nrevealed the deep wounds inflicted by the colonialist \nmentality that kept Africa under its hegemony for \ncenturies. Today, however, this cold colonial attitude \nstands aloof from places where it has no interest, and is \nwatches idly as millions of children die for want of a \nmorsel of bread in Somalia. I will be frank. No one can \nspeak of peace, justice or civilization in the world if \nthe cry rising from Somalia is left unheard. No words \nare sufficient to describe the agony there. \n Turkey\u2019s approach to Somalia or any other \ninternational issue is firmly grounded on humanitarian \nprinciples, which is why we have launched a \n \n \n31 11-50865 \n \ncomprehensive aid campaign for Somalia with the \nstrong support of our nation. We have collected \ndonations from our people of about $300 million \nwithin the past two months; moreover, our \nhumanitarian assistance to date totals more than \n$30 million. We also organized an emergency meeting \nof the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, \nat which pledges exceeded $350 million. \n Along with emergency humanitarian aid, Turkey \nis also determined to help build the infrastructure and \nfacilities that will enable Somalia to stand on its own \nfeet. In that regard, Turkey has undertaken a wide \nrange of projects, from transportation to health and \neducation, and from agriculture to fisheries and \nconstruction, including roads, hospitals, schools and \nwater wells. By reopening our embassy in Mogadishu, \nwe have also shown the world that claims of security \nproblems cannot be an excuse for delaying assistance. \n Along with such measures, it is also essential that \nwe bring an end to the civil war as quickly as possible \nand provide Somalia with democratic and unified \ngovernance in order to succeed in the fight against the \npiracy and terrorism originating there. In that regard, \nwe would ask everyone to consider why the \ninternational community refuses to bestow on Somalia \nthe attention it has given to conflict areas elsewhere in \nthe world. The entire international community must act \nwith a sense of utmost urgency in support of the efforts \nto build peace and stability in Somalia. The civil war \nthat has suffocated our Somali brothers for 20 years \nmust end without further delay. \n In that context, the recent progress made by \nSomali leaders towards building a national consensus \ngives us hope for the future. As Somalia resumes its \nwell-deserved place within the international \ncommunity, the world will become a safer and more \nstable place. It is precisely this understanding that lies \nat the heart of Turkey\u2019s determined efforts to help \nSomalia. We are making every attempt to implement \ninfrastructure investments that will enable Somalia to \nstand on its feet, and working unrelentingly to help \nestablish an environment of political stability and \npeace conducive to sustainable development. We are \ndoing this solely because it is our humanitarian \nresponsibility, and with no other motive. It is our \ngreatest hope that the leadership demonstrated by \nTurkey in this area will set an example for the entire \ninternational community. \n For us, the United Nations symbolizes the ideal \nthat international law and justice shall prevail over \nsheer force and oppression, that peace shall prevail \nover conflict, and that the conscience of humanity shall \nprevail over narrow self-interest and political \nequilibrium. That is what I understand the United \nNations to be. \n The greatest impediment to the realization of this \nideal is the Arab-Israel conflict, which has been \nongoing for more than half a century. The fact that this \nproblem is still not resolved and that rights, law and \njustice have been sacrificed for the sake of political \nbalance is the greatest blow to the our sense of \ninternational justice.  \n To date, Israel has not complied with \u2014 and I \nemphasize this number \u2014 89 binding resolutions of the \nSecurity Council. In addition, there are hundreds of \nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly \u2014 this \nvery body \u2014 that Israel has ignored. Even more \nregrettable is the fact that the United Nations has been \nhelpless to take a single step to end the human tragedy \nsuffered by the Palestinian people.  \n Therefore, I must ask is whether the United \nNations will fail to implement the sanctions it has \nimposed on other countries just as it has failed to \nimplement its resolutions concerning Israel. Will the \nUnited Nations assiduously follow through on the \nresolutions it has taken with regard to other places, for \nexample, the Sudan? We really do need to look at \nourselves in the mirror. \n This situation causes great indignation in the \ninternational community in general. Therefore, it \ncannot remain unresolved; the international community \nmust act urgently to heal this bleeding wound.  \n Israel readily uses phosphate bombs and \npossesses the atom bomb, and has endured no \nsanctions. But if even the hint of such a possibility \nemerges elsewhere in the region, efforts are made to \nsuppress it. I ask whether that is fair and just.  \n To be frank, the problem in this context is caused \nby the Israeli Government. Those who govern the \ncountry take steps every day that, instead of paving the \nway for peace, build new barriers to it. Thus, it is the \nPalestinian territories that are under occupation, not \nIsraeli territory. It is a contradiction of history to say \nthat it the occupied lands are Israeli territory. It is \nPalestinian territory that is under occupation. It is \n  \n \n11-50865 32 \n \nIsrael that uses disproportionate force. Once again, it is \nIsrael that does not abide by international will. \n In this context, the illegal settlements that are still \nbeing established in the occupied territories of \nPalestine, despite the calls of the international \ncommunity to stop, as well as the blockade on Gaza, \nstand out in particular.  \n I ask the Assembly; Does the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights allow for a country, \nsociety or people to be cut off from international \njustice? In my copy of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, I do not see such a possibility. If you \nwant to send a box of tomatoes to Palestine, you must \nget permission from Israel, and I do not think that is \nhumane.  \n As I have stated before, those who govern Israel \nmust make a choice. Loopholes in the United Nations \nsystem and lobbies in some countries may give Israel \nthe opportunity to evade international law and justice \nas it pursues its illegitimate actions. However, that will \nnot ensure \u2014 and I say this with emphasis \u2014 the \nsecurity that Israel needs today.  \n Those who govern Israel must see that real \nsecurity is possible only by building real peace. I \nwould like once again to remind Israel from this \nrostrum that nothing can substitute for peace. What we \nface today is not a simple equation of peace for \nsecurity. Israel must read the newly flourishing \npolitical and social landscape in the Middle East and \nunderstand that it will no longer be possible to carry on \nin environment of continuous strife and conflict.  \n If we, as the international community, believe \nthat the ideal of establishing international peace and \nsecurity is the founding principle of the United \nNations, then it is time pressure Israel to achieve \npeace, despite the actions of its leaders, and to show it \nclearly that it is not above the law. \n  One of the most important steps that need to be \ntaken in this regard is responding to the legitimate \ndemands of the Palestinian people to be recognized as \na State and to have the representatives of the State of \nPalestine take their well-deserved place in this \nAssembly as a Member of the United Nations. Indeed, \nin 1947 the United Nations, through resolution \n181 (II), declared Palestine a State, but unfortunately \nthat resolution was not implemented.  \n Turkey\u2019s support for the recognition of the State \nof Palestine is unconditional. Turkey will continue to \nwork actively in the Middle East to ensure peace. We \nstand ready to do so. Accordingly, we will continue to \nwork actively for the resolution of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict, the recognition of the State of Palestine, the \nachievement of unity among Palestinians, and the \nlifting of the illegal blockade enforced against the \npeople of Gaza.  \n This commitment is a natural extension of our \nvision for regional peace and stability and our \ncommitment to international law and justice. It is also \nthe result of the responsibility we feel in this area. \nSimilarly, when a humanitarian aid convoy of \nparticipants from 33 countries was attacked by air and \nsea in international waters, resulting in the deaths of \nnine innocent civilians, we could not remain silent. Our \nreaction to Israel was a manifestation of our \nconviction.  \n Turkey has never pursued hostile and \nconfrontational policies against any State. Our foreign \npolicy is based on the principles of friendship and \ncooperation. Our policy towards Israel is no exception \nto these principles. However, Israel has seriously \nwronged a country and its people who have through \nhistory shown great friendship to it and its people. \nWhat we demand of Israel is clear. Israel must \napologize, pay compensation to the families of our \nmartyrs and lift the blockade on Gaza. Until Israel \nmeets these demands and takes steps in this direction, \nour position will not change.  \n Let me also emphasize from this rostrum that we \ndo not have a problem with the people of Israel. Our \nproblem arises from the aggressive policies of the \ncurrent Israeli Government. In fact, we have had very \nconstructive relations with previous Israeli \nGovernments, making great strides in a number of \nareas. Currently, the source of tension is solely the \nIsraeli Government.  \n Turkey is a country that is trustworthy in the \ninternational arena and whose friendship and \ncooperation are sought. We will not abandon this \nprincipled and determined policy. \n We are witnessing a historic process of \ntransformation and change in the Middle East. From \nthe very first day when these events began, we \nappealed to all administrations in the region to lend an \near to the calls of their people for democracy. The \n \n \n33 11-50865 \n \nultimate source of legitimacy for every Government is, \nabove all, the people and its will. What needs to be \ndone is to ensure that the people\u2019s will is realized in a \nfree and open manner. \n We have also said that sovereignty derives from \nthe will of the people. Any sovereignty that does not \nrest on the will of the people is not legitimate. \nSovereignty does not allow any leader or any regime to \nrepress its own people or kill innocent civilians. A \nregime that points guns at its own people can have no \nsovereignty or legitimacy. Today, everyone must \nunderstand that times have changed. The era of \nGovernments that do not meet the legitimate needs and \nexpectations of their people and of administrations that \noppress and repress their people and fail to give the \nhighest priority to justice has come to an end.  \n This was the call we made. We are very pleased \nto see that our calls have been heeded in Egypt, Tunisia \nand Libya and have paved the way for democratic \ntransformation and transition on the basis of the \nlegitimate demands of the people in those countries. \nThis gives us hope for the future. We observe with \nregret, however, that some countries continue to stay \nbehind the curve of events and react with misguided \nreflexes owing to their outdated state of mind.  \n In that context, we are very closely following the \ndevelopments unfolding in Syria, which is our \nneighbour and therefore very important to Turkey. The \ncurrent situation in Syria gives us great cause for \nconcern. The actions of the Government are \nunacceptable and we have warned the Syrian \nleadership many times to that effect. We share a \n910-kilometre border. We have ties and relatives on \nboth sides of the border. We have always spoken the \ntruth, because we believe that friends always speak the \ntruth, no matter how bitter. We have always stated that \nthe voices, demands and wishes of the people must be \nheard. We have said that persecution and oppression \ncannot generate prosperity. We must listen to the call of \nthe people for democracy, not point guns at them.  \n Unfortunately, the Syrian leadership has \npersistently ignored our warnings. Now, every drop of \nblood spilled in the country only widens and deepens \nthe divide between the people and the administration of \nSyria. Turkey will continue to support the legitimate \nand democratic demands of the people of Syria and \nelsewhere, and to call on regimes to respect the wishes \nand expectations of their people. We expect the \ninternational community to do the same. \n  In that regard, we are increasing our cooperation \nwith Tunisia and Egypt. In Libya, Turkey has \nsupported the National Transitional Council from the \nvery beginning. We are very proud to announce that we \nwere the first country to restore its Ambassador to \nLibya. We will continue to staunchly support the new \nLibya as it resumes its well-deserved place in the \nUnited Nations as a democratic, united and \nindependent State.  \n During my visit to Libya last week, I went to \nTripoli, Tajura, Misurata and Benghazi, holding \nmeetings in all four cities. I met and spoke with the \npeople. I saw and sensed the righteous pride of the \nLibyan people in their revolution. I also witnessed the \ndestruction in Misurata.  \n I believe that the international community must \nbe very sensitive to certain issues in terms of Libya. \nFirst, Libya and its resources belong to the Libyans. As \ndemocracy is established in Libya, it is very important \nthat the country\u2019s frozen assets abroad be released \nimmediately so that Libya can stand on its own two \nfeet. We want to ensure that the Libyans have the \nresources they really need. Currently, the country has \n$170 billion in assets abroad, but the people cannot \nbenefit from them. In that regard, it is essential to \nimplement resolution 2009 (2011). The Libyan people \ncan determine their own future and we must respect \ntheir choices.  \n A fair, comprehensive and lasting solution must \nbe found to the long-standing problem in Cyprus, \nwhich has persisted for more than half a century. The \nUnited Nations plan put forward in 2004 demonstrated \nthat the parameters of a solution are there, but that the \nGreek Cypriot side lacks the necessary will to make it \na reality. The Turkish Cypriot side, however, has still \nnot been freed from the isolation imposed upon it, even \nthough it has always expressed its full determination to \nfind a solution. Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriot side \nhas remained committed to a peaceful solution and has \nparticipated with goodwill in the negotiations resumed \nunder United Nations auspices.  \n The objective is to finalize the negotiations by the \nend of this year and have the settlement plan endorsed \nin simultaneous referendums early next year, thus \nenabling a united new Cyprus to take its place in the \nEuropean Union without further delay. Turkey will \n  \n \n11-50865 34 \n \ncontinue to provide all necessary support so as to reach \na solution as soon as possible, in line with that \ntimetable. I wish to emphasize, however, that if the \nintransigent attitude of the Greek Cypriot side does not \npermit this to happen, as a guarantor country we will \nnot let the future of the Turkish Cypriots remain \nuncertain forever.  \n Moreover, at this critical juncture, we cannot \naccept any attempt by the Greek Cypriot side to act as \nif it were the sole representative of the Island or had \nthe authority to make decisions on behalf of the \nTurkish Cypriots. In that regard, the attempts of the \nGreek Cypriot side to unilaterally determine maritime \njurisdiction areas and to engage in exploration \nactivities in oil and natural gas fields are extremely \nirresponsible in terms of both timing and possible \noutcomes.  \n In the face of these unilateral activities of the \nGreek Cypriot side, which appear to be aimed at \nprovoking a crisis, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side \nwill act with common sense, but also will resolutely \nprotect their rights under international law. At this \npoint, we expect all concerned parties to work actively \nto ensure that the Greek Cypriot Administration halts \nthese activities, which could lead to tension, not only \non the Island, but also throughout the region. \nOtherwise, we will do whatever is necessary.  \n The illegitimate occupation of Azerbaijani \nterritories, which has been ongoing for many years, \nmust come to an end. It is unacceptable to allow the \nNagorny Karabakh conflict to remain unresolved to the \nextent that it is today.  \n All of us bear political and moral responsibility \nfor resolving international problems before they lead to \nstalemates. In that respect, more effective efforts must \nbe made to peacefully resolve the Kashmir conflict and \nmany other frozen disputes, which I will not enumerate \nhere. Conversely, peace and stability in the Balkans \ncan be achieved with the recognition of Kosovo\u2019s \nindependence.  \n Turkey has always been a staunch supporter of \nthe principles and goals enshrined in the Charter of the  \n \nUnited Nations. I believe that we showed our \ncommitment in that respect during our tenure as a \nnon-permanent member of the Security Council in \n2009-2010. I also believe that our effective \nperformance at that time attests to what we intend to do \nif re-elected to the Security Council for 2015-2016. In \nthis regard, I to take this opportunity to reaffirm that \nwe count on the support of all the Members of the \nGeneral Assembly for Turkey\u2019s candidacy to a \nnon-permanent seat in the Security Council for the \nterm 2015-2016. \n As yet another manifestation of our support for \nthe goals of the United Nations, we are also determined \nto pursue the Istanbul Programme of Action adopted at \nthe Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least \nDeveloped Countries, which Turkey hosted early this \nyear. We are also continuing our efforts to implement \nas soon as possible the announced package of \neconomic and technical cooperation for the least \ndeveloped countries. As part of that package, which \nincludes many areas of cooperation ranging from trade \nto education and agriculture to energy, we intend to \nprovide the least developed countries with annual \nassistance of $200 million. We also envisage increasing \nour direct investments in these countries to $5 billion \nand $12 billion by 2015 and 2020, respectively. \n We consider security, development and respect \nfor human rights to be integral parts of the same whole. \nTogether, they constitute the most fundamental \nguarantee of lasting peace. Turkey will continue to \nwork towards the attainment of these fundamental \nobjectives of the United Nations and make every effort \nto leave future generations a safer and more prosperous \nworld."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by extending my \nwarm congratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His \nstrong leadership will continue the high standard set by \nhis predecessor. I wish also to express to the Secretary-\nGeneral my deepest appreciation for his many \ncontributions and accomplishments, one of which is his \nrecent visit to the South Pacific island countries. I \ncongratulate him and wish him well in his second term. \n Last July, the Security Council took a giant step \nwith the adoption of a presidential statement \n(S/PRST/2011/15) during its debate on the issue of \nclimate change and its security implications. We were \nencouraged by that bold step. \n As a member of the Pacific small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS), we appreciate the \nunprecedented action taken by the Security Council as \nwe continue to face the threat to our existence and the \nloss of territorial integrity and sovereignty resulting \nfrom the adverse impacts of climate change and sea-\nlevel rise. The concerns expressed by the Council in \nconnection with climate change, in particular \nconcerning sea-level rise as a security threat, is an \nimportant step. \n We cannot but notice, however, the persistent \nfailure and reluctance by some countries to address the \nsecurity aspect of climate change, even in the face of \noverwhelming scientific evidence. We believe that \nthose who opposed the debate in the Council and those \nwho doubted the security implications of climate \nchange simply ignored the obvious.  \n We respectfully ask those members who opposed \nthe debate and those who are still in doubt to fulfil \ntheir responsibilities under the Charter of the United \nNations. We also take note of the positions of those \nwho aspire to membership in the Council, and we \nthank those countries who supported our cause. I \nstrongly urge the Security Council, and for that matter \nthe whole United Nations system, to utilize innovative \n \n \n25 11-51191 \n \nways to address the concerns of the most vulnerable \nMembers of this Organization. \n We are grateful for the historic visit by Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to our region on the fortieth \nanniversary of the Pacific Islands Forum. It was also \nthe first time in the 66-year history of this body that a \nSecretary-General has ever visited any Pacific small \nisland developing State \u2014 on this occasion, Kiribati \nand the Solomon Islands. We are confident that the \nSecretary-General\u2019s visit will give a greater sense of \nurgency to the issue of climate change. \n Climate change is no longer a hypothetical issue \nbut a real tragedy, as we in the Pacific region are \nalready experiencing its adverse effects. These impacts \nwill continue to worsen until countries like mine \ndisappear, unless immediate and decisive actions are \ntaken by this body to mitigate climate change at first \nevidence.  \n It is imperative that we immediately begin to \nreduce emissions of long-lasting greenhouse gases like \ncarbon dioxide. We must complement the action on \ncarbon dioxide by reducing short-lived climate forcers \nsuch as black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and \nhydrofluorocarbons in order to prevent an additional \nincrease of as much as one degree Celsius in global \nwarming over the next decades. Reducing these short-\nlived agents is one of the surest ways to protect some \nof the Earth\u2019s most vulnerable regions such as the \nFederated States of Micronesia. \n I therefore call upon the international community \nto join this strategic approach to meeting the challenge \nof climate change. The time to act is now. \n More than 60 years ago, my island country, the \nFederated States of Micronesia, drew world attention \nas a battleground in the Pacific conflict. Today, the \nremnants of approximately 60 shipwrecks from that \nconflict are posing threats to the lives of our people, \nour environment and the marine ecosystem. \nApproximately 32 million litres of oil contained in the \nbellies of the wrecks are a ticking environmental time \nbomb. Leading experts on underwater corrosion have \nwarned that the shipwrecks will collapse, and when \nthey do, we believe that oil from these wrecks could \ncreate a spill on a massive scale, with an impact \ncomparable to the disaster last year in the Gulf of \nMexico. \n Oil from these shipwrecks in my state of Chuuk \nhas already started leaking. Any disaster could have a \ndevastating effect on the environment, our food chain \nand the surrounding reefs that serve as breeding \ngrounds for many fish species. It would also adversely \nimpact our tourism industry, which depends largely on \ncoral and shipwreck diving. Thus to avoid a major \nenvironmental disaster, I am now appealing to the \ninternational community for immediate assistance. \n Twenty years ago my country gained membership \nin the Organization, just in time to become a part of the \nmovement known as the Rio process. Out of that \nprocess, the principle of sustainability became a \nmandate for development. For the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), \nMicronesia and other small island developing States \nhave been calling for recognition of what we term the \n\u201cblue economy\u201d. As island nations with millions of \nsquare miles of the blue Pacific, we naturally have \nparticular affinity and concerns for the ocean. \n Our ocean\u2019s resources have enormous strategic \nvalue. We depend on them for our subsistence living \nand cultural identity as seafarers of the Pacific. The \nblue Pacific has opened up new horizons in sustainable \neconomic development activities. As custodian of these \nresources, we welcome the participation of our partners \nin the utilization of these resources, but for too long we \nhave not received an equitable and fair share of our \nocean bounties. \n The development of our ocean resources is \nseverely hampered by the continuous selfish \nbehaviours of illegal, unreported and unregulated \nfishing. If unabated, these kinds of behaviour will \ncontinue to deprive our people and our nascent fishing \nindustries of millions of dollars in revenues every year. \nThe fishing industry is further adversely affected by \nocean acidification caused by climate change. \n Conservation and sustainable management of \noceanic resources is important, because we will \ncontinue to depend on the ocean in the years ahead. It \nis for that reason that we have committed to various \nconservation activities in the Micronesian region. One \nin particular is our support for the establishment of \nshark sanctuaries. The Federated States of Micronesia \nhas joined Palau and other countries in committing a \nvast area in our Micronesian region to be a sanctuary \nfor sharks. \n  \n \n11-51191 26 \n \n The current mechanisms for follow-up on the \nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action \nand the Mauritius Strategy for Further Implementation \nare unlikely to provide the momentum necessary to \ntake concrete steps as part of a results-oriented \napproach. New and additional measures to address the \nunique and particular vulnerabilities and development \nof SIDS are required. \n Along with the Pacific SIDS, we are advancing a \nproposal for Rio+20 to consider a third Global \nConference on the Sustainable Development of SIDS. \nWe must build upon the momentum of Rio+20 to \nconvene a third Global Conference to refocus and \ndevelop new and additional measures that are results-\noriented to support the sustainable development of \nSIDS. \n A special category for small island developing \nStates is imperative if the United Nations is to improve \nthe lot of the disadvantaged peoples of SIDS. After all, \nrealities demand it. I therefore reiterate the call made \nlast year by my own country and other small island \ndeveloping States for the creation of that special \ncategory. \n I am grateful for the attention paid by the United \nNations High-level Meeting on Non-communicable \nDiseases (NCDs) held earlier in the week. \n It is a major concern for us in the Pacific SIDS \nthat non-communicable diseases have reached \nepidemic proportions. If allowed to continue unabated, \nNCDs could potentially undermine our labour supply, \nproductivity, investment and education, with \ndevastating consequences for our economic \ndevelopment. I echo the sentiments on NCDs expressed \nby Pacific leaders regarding the importance of \nimmediate and decisive actions by Governments, the \nprivate sector, civil society, regional and international \norganizations and development partners to work \ntogether to address what is now a human, social and \neconomic crisis for us in the Pacific. \n At the beginning of the current session, we \nwitnessed history of another kind unfolding in the Hall. \nFor the first time, a female President stood at this \npodium to open the general debate. I join other world \nleaders in congratulating Her Excellency Ms. Dilma \nRousseff of Brazil on her many achievements. The \nchallenge for this body is to continue to encourage \nwomen from all nations to participate on an equal basis \nat all levels of political decision-making processes. \nAfter all, women are equal partners in families. \n In joining the debate on the Israeli-Palestinian \nissue, my country urges the international community to \nremain steadfast in upholding the principles of peaceful \ncoexistence as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \nWe continue to support Israel\u2019s right to live within \nsecure and recognized borders, free from the fear of \nterrorism. We also acknowledge Palestine\u2019s right to \nstatehood, which can be achieved only through a \nnegotiated settlement between the two parties. I agree \nwith President Obama that there are no shortcuts to \nsolving this problem. \n Just halfway into the year, people everywhere are \nexperiencing the impact of natural disasters, making it \nthe costliest year on record. They have caused not only \nproperty damage but also the loss of human lives. I \nwant to extend my people\u2019s sincere sympathies for the \nlives lost and the suffering everywhere. \n On the twentieth anniversary of my country\u2019s \nadmission to the United Nations, we pledge to do our \nbest to support the goals of this Organization for the \nbenefit of our people and all peoples around the world."

        "file_text": "As the world continues to \ndeal with crises, including conflicts across the globe, \nwe need to examine the role of mediation in the \npeaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \nresolution, and the part each one of us needs to play. \n The effect of decades of conflict has been an \nunacceptable loss of life and a reversal of global social \nand economic progress. What has also become clear is \nthat although most conflicts are now domestic in \nnature, they continue to have a destabilizing effect on \nneighbouring countries and the rest of the world. \n One needs to look carefully at the dividends of \nstriving towards shared global prosperity, which in turn \nincreases capacity to deal with conflict. By tackling \ndevelopment issues, for example, through the \nframework of the Millennium Development Goals, \nestablished by this body and the Secretary-General, we \ncreate conditions conducive to the formation of a more \nstable world. \n Figures from the United Nations itself indicate \nthat about $7.1 billion will be spent in the period \n2011-2012 for peacekeeping purposes. Resources such \nas these that are consumed by conflicts could otherwise \nbe channelled through the United Nations or other \nrelevant institutions to improve the lives of millions of \npeople. \n Thus, while it is appropriate to talk about how \nmediation can support efforts to prevent and manage \nconflicts, we should also ask ourselves why, after \ndecades of trying, we are not making the progress we \nwould like to make in this regard. We know that the likelihood of conflict is high \nwhen citizens feel disenfranchised and marginalized, \nand where Governments do not govern in the interests \nof their people. If the rule of law is absent and access \nto opportunity is limited or exclusive, that is a problem \nwhich we should address as a global community, \nconsistently and with commitment. It makes good \neconomic and political sense to invest in conflict \nprevention, thus reducing future outbreaks and \navoiding short-term, quick-fix solutions.  \n Apart from traditional interventions that we \nemploy with varying success, there is one major asset \nthat remains under-utilized, and that is our youth. \nYounger generations carry less historical and political \nbaggage and are more inclined to get the most out of \nthe global village that we all find ourselves sharing. \nWith social and communication tools, they are key \ninnovators and thought leaders not only of tomorrow \nbut of right now. We have an important responsibility \nto empower them to believe in themselves and in a \nbetter future. \n Returning to the topic of mediation and the \nassociated issues of negotiation and reconciliation, \nthese practices are not new ones in Africa, or in my \ncountry, Rwanda. They play a useful role, and one that \nshould be strengthened. However, various experiences \nhave shown that if mediation is to succeed, national \nefforts should be supported in the first place, based on \nspecific cultural and political contexts. In Rwanda, for \ninstance, we have seen national efforts produce long-\nlasting solutions and tangible results on the ground \nbecause they are homegrown. \n It is also important to involve in mediation efforts \nregional and subregional players who have ample \nknowledge of the often complex regional dynamics of \nconflicts. These organizations should be supported \nexpeditiously before disputes escalate into intractable \nconflicts. \n Additionally, we need to take a good look at the \ntoll that traditional diplomatic mediation can have on \n  \n \n11-50702 12 \n \nthe lives of people living in conflict areas. Too often, \nwhile resolutions are being debated and refined, people \nare dying. And sometimes when those resolutions are \neventually adopted, enforcement is slow, or they only \nhalt the conflict for a short time but with no sustainable \nsolutions. \n Let us also remember the limitations faced by \nexternal mediation experts who, even when having \ngood intentions, are often unable to foster any lasting \nchange at the root level of the conflict. National \nownership remains very critical. Mediation efforts \nmust be based on an overriding desire to help \nconflicting parties to resolve their differences. But that \nshould not be confused with supporting one side in the \nconflict or imposing a solution that is in the interests of \nthe mediators. \n Let me conclude by saying that the most viable \noption for preventing conflict is to empower our own \ncitizens, especially youth, politically, economically and \nsocially, so that they have a stake in the management \nand stability of the nation. Ultimately, long-lasting \nsolutions are the ones that emanate from within."

        "file_text": "I would like to begin \nby congratulating Mr. Al-Nasser on his assumption of \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsixth session. I express my gratitude to Mr. Joseph \nDeiss for his devoted efforts during his tenure as \nPresident of the Assembly at the sixty-fifth session. I \nwould also like to pay my deep respects to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his leadership.\n This has been a year of extraordinary challenges \nfor Japan. A little more than six months have passed \nsince the Great East Japan Earthquake struck Japan. \nNearly 20,000 people were killed or remain missing, \nand nearly 40,000 who were forced to evacuate \ncontinue to endure inconvenience in their daily lives. I \nam truly proud to see the noble spirit of the Japanese \npeople manifest itself even amid such despair and \nhardship. At the same time, I have been deeply moved \nby the strong feelings of compassion shown by people \nthe world over towards Japan. There are many \nunforgettable stories. \n Ms. Rita Retnaningtyas, an Indonesian nurse \ncandidate and trainee at the Miyagi Hospital, evacuated \n120 patients from the hospital to a safer location just \nbefore the arrival of the tsunami. She stayed on at the \nhospital for several days, taking care of the patients in \nthe absence of electricity and water. \n In Brazil, the children of a small rural town \ncollected change and sent their contributions to us in a \ntin can. I heard that, when asked why, one of the \nchildren answered that it was because Japan, a friend \nof Brazil, was suffering. \n University students in Kenya gathered in Nairobi \nin memory of Japanese victims of the earthquake. They \n \n \n31 11-51185 \n \nsang in chorus the popular Japanese song known \noutside Japan as \u201cSukiyaki\u201d \u2014 whose original \nJapanese title reads \u201cLet Us Walk Looking Up\u201d \u2014 \nsaying that they wished to deliver the song to the \nJapanese people. \n Those are only a few such stories among tens of \nthousands. The world expressed friendship, solidarity \nand praise for the Japanese people immediately after \nthe earthquake. On behalf of the people of Japan, I \nexpress my heartfelt gratitude for the helping hands \nextended from all over the world. These bonds between \nJapan and the international community will be forever \nremembered by the Japanese. \n Since 11 March, the sounds of recovery have \nechoed throughout the Tohoku region of Japan. The \nGovernment of Japan has exerted every effort to \nrestore and reconstruct the disaster-affected areas. The \ndaily lives of those outside the affected areas, \nincluding the metropolitan area of Tokyo, have \nreturned almost to normal. The infrastructure and \neconomy of the coastal areas of Tohoku, which were \nwashed away by the tsunami, are recovering. Damaged \nsupply chains are close to full restoration. We have \nbeen sharply reminded of the role that Japanese \ncompanies, including small and medium-sized \nenterprises, play in sustaining the growth of the global \neconomy. \n We are making steady progress towards securing \nstable control of the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi \nnuclear power stations of the Tokyo Electric Power \nCompany. Currently, we are focusing our efforts on \nmoving up the existing target period to achieve cold \nshutdown status by the end of this year. A number of \nother challenges remain to be addressed, including the \nremoval of debris and rebuilding of the livelihoods of \nthe Japanese people in the affected areas. We will \ncontinue to be fully engaged in the restoration and \nreconstruction efforts as our highest priority task so \nthat Japan\u2019s renewal can be realized without delay.  \n As the new leader of Japan, I am deeply honoured \nto discuss and share Japan\u2019s ambitions for the world\u2019s \nfuture, as well as Japan\u2019s diplomatic vision, with all \nthose in attendance here today at this meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly.  \n The world is undergoing tremendous changes, \nincluding those now under way in the Middle East and \nNorth Africa, which have been brought about by the \npeoples\u2019 awakening and their resulting common \nawareness. \n Through its experience of the massive earthquake \nin March, Japan was again made aware of the \nimportance of its bonds with the people of the world. \nWe have come to fully realize the importance of the \nresponsibility to society that is fulfilled by each \nindividual. We have never felt more strongly the \nsignificance of promoting human security. I am \nresolved to implement Japanese diplomacy by working \nclosely with all the world leaders here at the United \nNations, with the determination to make a substantive \ncontribution to overcoming the challenges that the \nworld faces and shaping a brighter future for humanity. \n Allow me to touch on Japan\u2019s efforts to help the \nworld economy grow. Japan has a long history of \nassisting developing countries to create prosperous \nsocieties through nation-building and human-resource \ndevelopment. From our own experience, we understand \nvery well that the engine of economic growth is a \nstrong middle class. In order to strengthen that middle \nclass, we must construct a social framework within \nwhich all individuals can strengthen their capacities \nand develop them to the full. In this regard, Japan will \ncontinue to actively support developing countries \nthrough its official development assistance. \n We must not let the current global economic \nuncertainty and financial unrest hamper the efforts of \nthe international community to achieve growth. It is \nvital that all countries cooperate in order to bring \nharmony out of the current chaos. I myself am \ncommitted to doing my best as the new leader of Japan. \nAchieving economic growth in tandem with fiscal \nhealth is the most crucial challenge confronting the \nworld at the present time. Japan will press ahead with \nits targets for restoring fiscal sustainability. \nMeanwhile, as we recognize that revitalizing the \nJapanese economy is directly linked to rebuilding the \nworld economy, we will work on strengthening \nindustrial infrastructure, employment and energy \nconservation in our efforts to achieve a full recovery \nfrom the earthquake disaster. In the mid-to-long term, \nwe intend to further reinforce partnerships between the \nJapanese and other global economies. It is also \nimportant that trade activities not be disturbed by \nexcessive currency volatility. \n Furthermore, in order to help realize sustainable \ngrowth of the Japanese economy, we will work to \n  \n \n11-51185 32 \n \nachieve a low-carbon society and a transition to a green \neconomy. The key to achieving these goals is \ntechnological innovation in the areas of renewable \nenergies, saving energy and the clean use of fossil \nfuels, all of which are considered part of green \ninnovation. By next summer, the Government of Japan \nwill have created a new strategy and plan for the \ncomposition of Japan\u2019s mid- to long-term energy use, \naimed at making a bold shift on energy policy. Japan \nwill also further improve on its excellent, safe, secure \nand environmentally friendly technologies, represented \nby energy-efficient houses and electric appliances and \nvehicles, contributing to the growth of the global \neconomy and to a brighter future for all during the \ndiscussions leading up to the 2012 United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development. \n Japan will throw all its efforts into seeking a safe \nand brighter future. The run-up height, which is the \nmaximum onshore vertical height above sea level, of \nthe tsunami that hit the Tohoku district reached as high \nas 40 metres, the highest in Japan in recorded history. \nWe have learned that we must be very well prepared. In \nthat regard, there are contributions that Japan, with \nsuch experience behind it, is uniquely qualified to \nmake. The first lesson to be learned from Japan\u2019s \nrecent tragedy is the importance of international \ncooperation in disaster risk reduction. \n We have a long history of combating and \novercoming natural disasters. In fact, we have actively \nsupported the response efforts to the disasters that have \noccurred in recent years in areas such as Sumatra, \nSichuan in China, Haiti and New Zealand. As a country \nthat has learned to coexist harmoniously with nature, \nwe are prepared to share with the world our \naccumulated knowledge and skills. As a first step, \nJapan will hold an international conference in the \ndisaster-stricken Tohoku region next year designed to \nimprove international cooperation on coping with \nnatural disasters. To build on the outcome of that \nconference, Japan proposes to host the Third United \nNations World Conference on Disaster Reduction in \n2015, and plans to take a leading role in the \ninternational community in creating a disaster-resistant \nworld. \n Next, Japan hopes to share its acquired \nknowledge and experience in the field of nuclear \nsafety. I welcomed yesterday\u2019s high-level meeting on \nthis issue held at the initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral. Following the nuclear accident, Japan has \nimplemented emergency safety measures and further \nstrengthened its nuclear energy regulation regime. In \nyesterday\u2019s meeting, I expressed my resolve to \ncontribute positively to the reinforcement of global \nnuclear power safety, drawing on our experiences with \nthe accident. \n Next year, Japan will co-host an international \nconference with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency to share the results of the overall assessment of \nthe accident in comprehensive detail, and to contribute \nto the various measures taken by the international \ncommunity to raise standards for nuclear safety. \nAlthough some countries, regrettably, are still \nimposing undue restrictions on imports from Japan, our \nGovernment will continue to provide prompt, accurate \nand transparent information on this matter. I would \nrequest that all countries make sensible judgements \nbased on scientific evidence. \n Global threats continue to proliferate. It is \nessential to deal with the root causes of such threats \nwhile taking steps to address them. Japan will continue \nto respond to those challenges in order to ensure a \nbrighter and more peaceful future. With regard to the \nissue of piracy off the coast of Somalia, Japan will \nremain actively engaged in combating the problem \nthrough continued deployment to the area of two \ndestroyers and two patrol aircraft. \n Japan intends to enhance its efforts to eradicate \nterrorism and its causes. Though a decade has passed \nsince the 9/11 attacks, our collective sorrow has yet to \nheal. And in that connection, I would like to express \nmy sincere condolences on the death of Mr. Rabbani, \nChairman of Afghanistan\u2019s High Peace Council. Japan \nreiterates its firm condemnation of such atrocious acts \nof terrorism. In order to prevent Afghanistan from once \nagain becoming a breeding ground for terrorism, we \nwill continue to confront the problem with strong \nresolve. Japan has expressed its commitment to \nproviding approximately $5 billion in assistance over \nfive years beginning in 2009, focusing on security, \nreintegrating former insurgents into society, and \ndevelopment, and will continue to implement that \ncommitment. \n United Nations peacekeeping missions are being \ndispatched to fragile and conflict-prone States. Japan \nwill contribute to peacebuilding efforts by actively \nparticipating in those operations. We must further \nimprove the conditions that promote that goal. At the \n \n \n33 11-51185 \n \nsame time, we will do our best to achieve the ideal of a \nworld without nuclear weapons through such efforts as \nthe multi-country non-proliferation and disarmament \ninitiative. \n The nuclear and missile issues of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea pose a threat to the entire \ninternational community, and Japan continues to urge \nthat country to take concrete steps towards resolving \nthose issues. In particular, the abduction issue \nrepresents a violation of basic human rights. It is thus \nan issue of universal import and a matter of great \nconcern for the entire international community. Japan \nis committed to exerting all possible efforts to achieve \nthe return of all the victims at the earliest possible date, \nthrough strengthened coordination with other Member \nStates. \n With regard to relations between Japan and the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Japan intends \nto maintain its efforts to comprehensively resolve the \noutstanding issues of concern, settle the unfortunate \npast and normalize relations, in accordance with the \nJapan-Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nPyongyang Declaration of 2007. Japan urges the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to take \npositive steps in order that our countries may have a \ndialogue toward this goal. \n In recent years, the role of the United Nations has \ntaken on greater significance than ever. In order for the \nUnited Nations to tackle such issues more effectively, \nJapan will continue to support increasing effectiveness \nand efficiency in reinforcing the functions of the \nUnited Nations. \n Security Council reform is absolutely necessary \nin that respect. We must revitalize the stagnated reform \nprocess. All Member States must proactively commit to \nthe reform with a sense of urgency. The credibility of \nthe United Nations is at stake. Japan intends to launch \nsubstantive negotiations toward the reform with like-\nminded Members, in order to achieve tangible results \nduring the current session. \n As I promised moments ago, Japan will recover \nfrom the earthquake disaster and seek a peaceful, safe \nand brighter future, side by side with the leaders \ngathered here. For that purpose, Japan will maintain its \ncontribution to the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, focusing on health and education. \nMoreover, Japan will continue its contribution to the \ndevelopment of Africa by hosting the Fifth Tokyo \nInternational Conference on African Development in \n2013. Regarding the support intended to enable \ndeveloping countries to address climate change, Japan \nwill implement its quick-start finance commitments up \nto next year. Japan will continue its support beyond \n2012. \n Today, I would like to announce Japan\u2019s new \ncommitments. First, I wish to congratulate the people \nof the Republic of South Sudan on achieving their \nindependence, and provide assurances that Japan will \nextend wherever possible support for the nation-\nbuilding efforts in South Sudan as well as for the \nconsolidation of peace in the region. Japan is eager to \ncontribute to the United Nations Mission in South \nSudan in the fields in which Japan excels. From this \npoint of view, we are preparing to dispatch Japanese \nSelf-Defence Forces personnel to Mission \nHeadquarters as staff officers. Japan is also interested \nin dispatching an engineering unit of our Self-Defence \nForces, regarding which the United Nations has \nexpressed high expectations. Japan therefore will \nconduct the necessary field study as early as possible. \n Second, Japan will remain actively involved in \nthe international community\u2019s efforts with regard to \nhumanitarian crises. One of the most pressing \nchallenges at present is the drought in the Horn of \nAfrica, which is directly affecting the children of the \nregion. To mitigate this suffering as effectively as \npossible, Japan will provide further humanitarian aid in \naddition to the approximately $100 million in \nassistance that it has already implemented. \n The last commitment I wish to announce \nconcerns the Middle East and North Africa. Japan will \nsupport reform and democratization efforts in this \nregion, which is now undergoing a massive change that \nis often referred to as the Arab Spring. To improve the \nemployment situation and support human resources \ndevelopment in the region, Japan is prepared to extend \nan additional yen loan worth approximately $1 billion \nfor projects that are expected to contribute to \ninfrastructure building and industrial development.  \n Moreover, we will provide support to ensure fair \nelections in Tunisia and Egypt, where polls are \nscheduled to be held in autumn of this year. For a new \nLibya, Japan will support the country\u2019s nation-building \nefforts in cooperation with the international \ncommunity, utilizing its expertise and technological \ncapacity. At the same time, Japan will deepen \n  \n \n11-51185 34 \n \neconomic relations with Middle Eastern and North \nAfrican countries by further promoting trade and \ninvestment through such means as trade insurance and \nexport loans. As Middle East peace represents the \nlinchpin for the peace and stability of the region, Japan \nwill make active efforts, such as extending assistance \nto the Palestinians, for the realization of the two-State \nsolution. \n To conclude my statement, I will touch briefly \nupon what I have felt in the aftermath of the Great East \nJapan Earthquake. After the events of 11 March this \nyear, I strongly felt the magnificence of a society in \nwhich each individual undertakes actions in an orderly \nmanner, a society in which people help each other. In \naddition, all lines of the Tohoku shinkansen bullet \ntrains, including a train that was running at \n270 kilometres per hour at the time of the earthquake, \nmade emergency stops safely, without causing a single \ninjury. I believe this fact bears witness to Japan\u2019s high \nlevel of technical advancement. \n I thus believe in the strength of the Japanese \npeople, which comes to the fore most prominently in \ntimes of crisis. I am certain that such resilience, both \nhuman and technological, which does not yield in the \nface of enormous difficulties, will be the very source of \nJapan\u2019s future contribution to the international \ncommunity. \n Let us take up the challenges for the resolution of \nthe issues confronting the world today, with strong \ndetermination to pave the way to a brighter future for \nhumanity. As the new leader of Japan, I am determined \nto make progress step by step towards a more peaceful, \nprosperous and positive future, hand in hand with the \nleaders assembled here today. \n The people of Japan as well as the Government \nare determined to overcome any and all difficulties. We \nwill continue our contribution towards a brighter future \nfor the people of the world. \n I wish to close my statement by reiterating our \nfirm determination."

        "file_text": "Allow me first to convey to \nthe President my warmest congratulations on his \nelection to guide the work of the sixty-sixth session of \nthe General Assembly. I have no doubt that under his \nleadership, Qatar will be instrumental in the service of \nhis presidency, and, indeed, in that of the Assembly as \na whole, as we face the challenging times ahead. I also \nrecognize the service of his predecessor and wish to \nrecord our appreciation for that service. To our \nSecretary-General, I offer my delegation\u2019s \ncongratulations on the renewal of his mandate, an act \nthat bears testimony to the confidence placed in him by \nthe Member States of this body. \n This is the last time that I will address this great \nHall as President of my country. Before the end of the \nyear, I will be proud to be the first President of Guyana \nto demit office under the constitutional term limits that \nI signed into law in the early days of my presidency. \nInevitably, that milestone has caused me to look back \non the changes that have taken place in this body since \nI first stood here 12 years ago. Three things strike me \n  \n \n11-50702 16 \n \nas I reflect on the role of the United Nations over those \n12 years. \n The first is that the central point that I and others \nhave repeatedly made from this rostrum stays as true \ntoday as it was when we first articulated it. The core \npoint is that, while the values that inform the work of \nthe United Nations and our Member States \u2014 the \nvalues of peace, equality and justice \u2014 are timeless, \nthey are of limited use unless we, as the United Nations \nand as individual Member States, draw on them to \ncatalyse consistent, meaningful and practical responses \nto the contemporary changing challenges that our \npeoples face. \n The second point that strikes me is how utterly \ndifferent today\u2019s contemporary challenges actually are \nwhen compared with those of just 12 years ago, not to \nmention those of the 1940s, when the United Nations \nwas founded. The rise of China, India, Brazil and other \ndeveloping countries is transforming the globe for the \nbetter. Billions of people have been lifted out of \npoverty; new businesses are generating millions of \njobs, growth and capital; and there is once again \ngenuine intellectual debate about the right way to \nembed rights and justice at the core of the global \ngovernance structure. \n However, the emergence of those great Powers is \nhappening in a totally different way to how Powers \nemerged in the past. They are emerging in a world that \nis interconnected through instant communications \ncapabilities and globalized trading and financial \nsystems. What we are witnessing is unlike anything \nthat has happened before, and few communities and no \ncountry on the planet are not impacted, almost in real \ntime, by those changes as they happen. \n That presents the United Nations and its Member \nStates with a great opportunity to realize our values \nand to secure the global peace, justice and security to \nwhich we aspire. But to do so, we must face up to the \nopportunities of interconnectedness with responses that \nare interconnected. Our record on international \ncollective action in recent years is not good. \n That leads me to my third point, which is that the \nsearch for justice and the achievement of rights for all \nrequire us to broaden our traditional understanding of \nsecurity. We must struggle to achieve rights in a new \nway and, as many have said before me, alongside the \nphysical security challenge, there are many other \naspects to human security and the realization of rights. \nI think that there are four other elements of security, in \nparticular, that we need to properly understand. \n First is the challenge of food security. We are \nheading for 8 billion, then 9 billion people. Rising \nprosperity means that those people want greater \namounts of, and more nutritious, food. By current \ntrends, we need 100 million hectares of new land by \n2020 to meet that demand. How do we do that and \navoid excessive price increases and volatility? \n Second is the challenge of energy security. As the \nworld gets richer, our demand for energy increases \nmassively. We are likely to demand 36 per cent more \nenergy by 2035. How do we generate the energy \nneeded to meet such demand in a way that helps people \neverywhere to develop and does not choke off \neconomic growth through high prices caused by energy \nscarcity? \n Third is the challenge of resource security. If we \nare to alleviate poverty, countries need to develop. And \nif countries are to develop, they need minerals and \nother commodities. China alone accounts for more than \na third of the demand for many of the most important \nglobal commodities, and countries across the world, \nmost notably in South America and Africa, can supply \nthem. How do we help global development by sourcing \nsuch minerals and using them efficiently and justly? \n Fourth is the challenge of climate security. If we \nare to avert the biggest economic and social \ncatastrophe ever seen, we must stabilize our planet\u2019s \nclimate. At the absolute limit, that means stabilizing \nglobal temperatures at a maximum of two degrees \nabove pre-industrial levels. Yet we are on track towards \nperhaps a four- or five-degree rise, according to the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme. The disaster \nthat this could represent is beyond anyone\u2019s \ncomprehension. And the fact that we are not treating it \nas an emergency will be viewed by history as the \nbiggest derogation of responsibility by societies and \nGovernments to ever take place. How can we rapidly \nchange that situation before we run out of time? \n Those four challenges represent both \nopportunities and difficulties. The difficulties are \nobvious, but they are opportunities in the sense that we \nhave enough land, innovation and human ingenuity to \nfeed the world. We have enough clean energy potential \nto power future prosperity. We have enough resources \nto provide the foundations for economic growth. We \nknow that to avert climate change means using fossil \n \n \n17 11-50702 \n \nfuels and land in the right way. Once we start realizing \nthose opportunities, we can create new platforms for \npeace, development and physical security. \n That sounds an impossible task, but I would \nargue that it is not. There are solutions to enable those \nopportunities to be grasped today, and the United \nNations can provide the platform for making the \nchanges that are needed. We can do that if we draw \nmotivation from the realization that the idea of \nintegrated sustainable development, where we optimize \nour response to the interlinked security challenges, is \nnot some abstraction for environmentalists. It is not a \npiece of rhetoric about a theoretical better future. \nInstead, it is an essential and specific call to action that \nhas the potential to be the key global breakthrough of \nour time. It can change the global paradigm of \ndevelopment in a way that enables us to address the \ninterconnected security challenges we face in the world \ntoday.  \n Pursuing this integrated response to our global \nchallenges presents unparalleled opportunities for \npeoples across today\u2019s developing world. The food we \nneed, the energy we generate, the minerals and other \ncommodities from which we grow our economies, \nalong with our forests and other land that can be the \ndrivers of climate solutions, are all largely in the \ndeveloping world. With the right international action, \nthe developing world can lead the globe in the creation \nof the transformational shift we need to see.  \n Importantly, within the United Nations, we \nalready have many of the entities we need to solve \nthese problems in an integrated way. That realization \nshould motivate us to understand that by next year\u2019s \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, we can start to make the progress that is \nnecessary. \n But that means consistency in our efforts to \naddress all forms of insecurity. We need to support \npeaceful peoples everywhere to assert their basic rights \nto physical security and development. The global \nresponse to the Arab Spring and other peace \nmovements across the Middle East has been \nremarkable for its inconsistency. Guyana supports the \nright of the Palestinian people to full statehood and \nurges the acceleration of the negotiations to achieve \nthis. Palestinian rights and blood are as valuable and \nimportant as those of people everywhere else. I urge all \nMembers to support the draft resolution when it comes \nbefore this body. \n Guyana was delighted to co-sponsor resolution \n65/308 that resulted in the entry of South Sudan into \nthis General Assembly. But we need to do much more. \nGuyana will be supportive of all peoples who struggle \nfor democracy and dignity. \n This also means that we need to rapidly upgrade \nour response to supporting development, food, energy \nand resource security. We need to see the Doha trade \nround not as some zero-sum game between the \ndeveloped and developing world, but as a critical \ncomponent to enable the world to meet the urgent \nchallenges that an increasingly prosperous, growing \npopulation will present. We need to redouble our \nefforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals, \nand to defeat non-communicable diseases. Guyana \ntherefore welcomes this week\u2019s meeting on \nnon-communicable diseases and the adoption of the \nPolitical Declaration (resolution 66/2, annex). \n Finally, we need to move beyond the global \ninsanity that is our response to climate insecurity. \nExisting pledges on greenhouse gas emissions under \nthe Copenhagen Accord will not contain global \ntemperature rises within limits that will avert \ncatastrophic climate change, and some States will face \nextinction. Moreover, the anaemic delivery on financial \npledges made at Copenhagen and formalized in the \nCanc\u00fan agreements is leading to a disastrous \nbreakdown in trust between the developed and \ndeveloping world. The prospects for reaching an \ninternationally legally binding agreement on climate \nchange at the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange in Durban, South Africa, would appear rather \nbleak. There is therefore an urgent need for high-order \npolitical leadership to re-energize the climate change \nprocess and deliver credible results. \n To address these challenges, the United Nations \nand other international institutions need to modernize \nfast, and the international system needs to correct the \ninconsistencies between aid, trade and climate policies \nas I have outlined. In part, this means making the \nSecurity Council more democratic, transparent and \nlegitimate. Fifty-four African countries have no \npermanent seat on the Council; neither do the \n33 countries that comprise the Latin American and \nCaribbean region. Guyana strongly supports early \n  \n \n11-50702 18 \n \nreform of the Security Council through an expansion in \nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories and \nenhanced representation of developing countries. \n Today\u2019s developed world needs to catch up with \nthe realization that the world has changed, and it is in \nits vital national interests to change its approach to \ndevelopment issues. Food security is not just about \npeople in poor countries; prices in Europe and the \nUnited States are rising too. Energy insecurity will hit \ntoday\u2019s developed countries and destroy their \ncompetitiveness as rapidly as it will hit the developing \nworld. Resource insecurity is already driving up \nimported inflation in many developed countries and \nelsewhere. Climate insecurity could be the tipping \npoint for today\u2019s Powers to be relegated to history, with \nall the suffering that would entail for their peoples. \n So the narrative is changing and I hope that we \nwill rise to the challenge. From now on, I will watch \nthe proceedings in this Hall from afar, but for all of my \ninvocations to the United Nations to do better, it \nremains the place where noble ambitions are pursued. I \nwish the United Nations and its Members all the best \nfor a secure, prosperous and socially just future. On \nbehalf of my country and people, I express our full \nsupport for the Organization and for strengthening its \ncapacity to better fulfil the many mandates entrusted to \nit. \n"

        "file_text": "Much has been said from this rostrum in recent years \nabout global governance. Yet in fact there is a \npervasive feeling that chaos is inexorably engulfing our \nplanet. Indeed, one global crisis comes hard on the \nheels of another. International law is being shamelessly \ntrampled. Inequality and poverty are on the rise, and \nabove all, an ever increasing number of people in the \nworld are exposed to suffering. \n This is the logical outcome of the world operating \nwithout a system and order. Twenty years ago, the \ninternational community had its own constitutional \nmoment as a result of the end of an epochal \nconfrontation, an opportunity to elaborate a \ncomprehensive strategy for stable development of the \nworld in the future. We missed that opportunity, first of \nall because egoism and gloating rather than common \nsense took the upper hand in the mindset of the \nso-called winners. \n The lack of common vision excluded the \npossibility of our taking effective concerted action. As \na result, the international community today is only \nreacting to ever-rising global challenges, having no \nrecourse to instruments that might prevent them. The \nsituation is bound to persist unless we arrive together \nat a set of long-term, efficient measures. We need a \nglobal strategy against chaos. \n The failures of the international community over \nthe past twenty years suggest that for such a strategy to \nbecome a strategy for success, it would have to be built \naround the following three foundations: strengthening \ninternational law, establishing global partnerships and \nrevitalizing the United Nations. \n The history of mankind has always been the \nhistory of the opposition of power and law. Only in the \npast century has that argument been resolved, and only \nde jure, in favour of the latter. By the way, it is hardly \nan exaggeration to say that a civilization is shaped by \nits transition from power to law. \n Belarus is firmly convinced that a strategy \nagainst chaos cannot succeed if we fail to preserve and \nstrengthen the system of international law as a \ndeterrent against lawlessness and impunity. Clearly, \nthere is more than enough reason to be concerned, \nsince power, de facto, dominates law more often than \nnot.  \n This year we have witnessed far-reaching \nchanges in the Middle East. The countries of that \nregion have the inalienable right to determine their \nown way of development. All of us must respect the \nchoice made by those States and refrain from \ninterfering in their internal affairs. That is our \ninternational obligation as Member States of the United \nNations. \n Unfortunately, not every country complies with \nits international obligations concerning the free choice \nof development paths. For decades the United States of \nAmerica has maintained an economic, trade and \nfinancial blockade against freedom-loving Cuba. That \nis a clear violation of United Nations principles and \ndecisions. \n \n \n11 11-51670 \n \n Belarus has also found itself the target not only of \nmalicious attacks but also of economic sanctions for \nthe choice that the Belarussian nation made with the \nelection of its own President. Belarussians will never \nrenounce their right of choice. Determining our own \npath of development is a sacred value to us. Neither \nsanctions nor blackmail and threats will alter our \nstance. Justice is on our side. \n Belarus has never tried to teach anyone how to \nlive. We consistently advocate the need to respect the \ndiverse development paths of the world\u2019s nations. The \nRepublic of Belarus stands ready to develop mutually \nbeneficial cooperation with all countries, even those \nwith whom we continue to have acute differences. \nAfter all, we are simply asking that others treat us as \nwe treat them, with respect and equality. That is our \nright too. \n The great Albert Einstein once said: \u201cProblems \ncannot be solved at the same level of awareness that \ncreated them.\u201d The growing transnational challenges \nand threats cannot be successfully addressed through \ntraditional foreign policy tools such as balance of \npower, spheres of influence, sanctions and threats. We \nneed new forms of cooperation that factor in the two \ncontemporary global shifts that foreign policy analysts \ncorrectly emphasize: from the West to the rest, and \nfrom States to non-State actors. \n We believe that global partnerships among States, \ninternational organizations, civil society and the \nprivate sector represent the best form of cooperation \nfor facing those and any other challenges. \n Global partnerships constitute an integral part of \nthe strategy against chaos. It is just such partnerships \nthat can ensure a real pooling of efforts by interested \nstakeholders in today\u2019s world in order to oppose the \nwhole array of challenges and threats that recognize no \nborders. We are certain that at the international level \nthere is no alternative to integration and inclusiveness. \nGlobalization and interdependence have made all of us \nequally vulnerable to transnational problems. Thus, \nthere cannot be well-being and stability in the world \nfor the few while others live in poverty and suffering.  \n The profound changes in Africa and the Middle \nEast caused by the growing problems of poverty and \ninequality dictate the need to achieve a global \npartnership for development. Last year\u2019s High-level \nMeeting at the United Nations and the Seoul Meeting \nof the Group of 20 made important contributions to the \nefforts in this field. At the same time, the relentless rise \nof oil, food and energy prices across the globe points \nout a new strain on development, hence the need for \nmore proactive and unconventional approaches. \n Among such specific approaches, we consider it \nimportant to address the issue of the transfer of \neffective, cutting-edge energy technologies to \ndeveloping and middle-income countries. That is also a \nkey element for overcoming the problems of climate \nchange. What is crucial here is that such technologies \nalready exist and are established in many parts of the \nglobe. Therefore, the difficulties are not technical.  \n Ultimately, let us grasp one point: today it is \nimpossible to have a green paradise for the affluent \ncountries while the poor ones live in a contaminated \nhell. The finite nature of Earth rules out such a \nscenario.  \n As a practical step, Belarus would like to suggest \nsetting up a global mechanism \u2014 through a General \nAssembly resolution on new and renewable sources of \nenergy and under the outcome document of the Rio+20 \nConference \u2014 under the aegis of the United Nations to \nensure access to modern energy technologies for all \ncountries of the world. That would be our best \ncontribution to the International Year of Sustainable \nEnergy for All that we are to celebrate in 2012. \n Over the past year, we have made important \nstrides in forging the Global Partnership against \nSlavery and Trafficking in Human Beings in the \nTwenty-first Century, initiated by Belarus. The \nimplementation of the Global Plan of Action to Combat \nTrafficking in Persons is under way. Interested States, \ninternational organizations and civil society, along with \nthe private sector, are already actively participating in \nthe process. It is gratifying that these efforts have \nfocused on protecting the rights of victims.  \n Throwing its full weight behind such an \napproach, Belarus was among the first States to make a \nvoluntary contribution to the United Nations Voluntary \nTrust Fund for Victims of Trafficking. We are grateful \nto those countries that joined in the work of the Group \nof Friends United against Human Trafficking. \n Among the prospects for establishing global \npartnerships, we see as highly promising the theme of \nsupporting youth. At the Assembly\u2019s High-level \nMeeting on Youth last year, Belarus came up with the \ninitiative to create a partnership to that effect. We \n  \n \n11-51670 12 \n \nwelcome the High-level Meeting on Youth held in July \nthis year in the context of the International Year of \nYouth. We hope that the event will be followed by the \ndevelopment of efficient global policies to protect the \ninterests of youth. \n There is a natural place where a strategy for \ndevelopment for the future must be devised and \nimplemented. That place is the United Nations. The \nquestion today is, to what extent is the United Nations \nfit to take this task upon itself? Let us be frank. We all \nhave claims against the United Nations. Indeed, the \nmajor task of the Organization over the past years \nseems to have been to survive various crises rather than \nto solve, let alone prevent, them.  \n Is the United Nations to blame for this state of \naffairs? Let us be outspoken once more and say \u201cNo\u201d. \nThe United Nations is us. It is us, the Member States, \nwho are at fault, because together we failed both to \ngrasp what kind of world we wanted to build and to \nadjust the United Nations to the new realities. \nTherefore, it is hardly surprising that the United \nNations has more frequently served as a stage for \nindividual actors rather than as a platform for common \naction. \n The need to revitalize the Organization stands out \nsharply as never before. We need to reform the \nprincipal organs of the United Nations and the \nfundamental orientation of its activities. \n The Security Council should not stay fixed in a \nform that was appropriate in era of realpolitik. In the \ninterests of developing countries above all, we are \nconvinced that the Council must be enlarged in both \ncategories. Bringing the Council\u2019s working methods \ninto conformity with the spirit of the age must serve to \nenhance the authority and efficiency of its work. \n The world is plagued by severe economic \nproblems, yet the substantial economic capacities of \nthe United Nations have not been properly utilized. \nThe activities of the Economic and Social Council \nshould be aligned with solutions to the urgent problems \nof Member States to a much greater extent than they \nare now. Belarus is eager to contribute to this work, \nincluding as member of the Council, provided that next \nmonth Member States do Belarus the honour of \nelecting it to that vital United Nations body. \n Strengthening the United Nations is impossible \nwithout striking a balance among the interests of \nvarious groups of countries. Several years ago, Belarus \nwas among the Member States that initiated efforts to \nhave the General Assembly pay greater attention to the \nproblems of middle-income countries. We are glad to \nsee that since then there has been a growing \nunderstanding of the significance of that group of \ncountries in world political and economic processes. At \nthe current session Belarus, together with like-minded \ncountries, will continue efforts to guide United Nations \norgans conducting operational activities towards a \nmore robust and efficient response to the specific needs \nof that group of countries and its many members. \n The authority of the United Nations among the \nworld\u2019s ordinary people is high in places where it \nreally helps in the transition from chaos and violence \nto order and stability through its peacekeeping \nactivities. In our view, efforts to strengthen this domain \ndemand the widest support. Responding to the request \nof the Secretary-General, Belarus started contributing \nas it could by taking part in peacekeeping operations. \n There is also the need to enhance the mediation \nrole of the United Nations in the settlement of disputes \nby peaceful means. For that it is important not only to \nbuild up the Organization\u2019s internal capacities, but to \nensure active United Nations cooperation with regional \norganizations, for instance the Collective Security \nTreaty Organization (CSTO), which know best the \nproblems in their own areas of responsibility. As the \ncurrent Chair of the CSTO, Belarus stands ready to \nassist in this effort as much as it can. \n Martin Luther King once said, \u201cThe time is \nalways right to do what is right.\u201d Let us heed this \nreasonable advice and, as the international community, \ndo without delay what we must do."

        "file_text": "\nI would first like to thank and wish every success to \nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to \nthank Mr. Deiss of Switzerland for his leadership \nduring the sixty-fifth session. I would also like to take \nthis opportunity to once again congratulate Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to a second \nterm in office. \n I would like to acknowledge the importance of \nthe choice of theme for this general debate, and to \nhighlight the role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means and as a way of preventing \nthe resumption of hostilities. \n We greatly appreciate the mediation efforts of \nglobal and regional entities and organizations in \nvarious parts of the world to preserve peace and \nsecurity and to settle conflicts through peaceful \nnegotiations. Particularly worth mentioning is the \nengagement of regional organizations, which have \ngained a great deal of experience in mediation and \nhave in-depth knowledge of political, cultural and \nmilitary realities on the ground. The success of \nmediation hinges, among other things, on the \narticulation of a clearly defined mandate. A case in \npoint for us has been the role of the Minsk Group of \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (OSCE) in settling the Nagorno Karabakh \nconflict. \n Another key factor worth highlighting here is the \nrole of mediators in preventing the escalation of \nconflict and a resumption of hostilities. This aspect of \nmediation is sometimes overlooked, yet it is of no less \nimportance to international peace and stability than is \nfinding a solution to a contentious matter. \n Three years ago, when I had the honour to speak \nfrom this rostrum (see A/63/PV.9), I said that the time \nhad come for serious consideration of people\u2019s right to \nself-determination in the twenty-first century. Today, \nwe are witnessing new instances of people exercising \nthis inalienable right. In that context, I would like to \ncongratulate the newly elected 193rd Member of the \nUnited Nations, the Republic of South Sudan. Its road \nto a seat in this Hall has been long and difficult, but the \npeople of South Sudan, through the free expression of \ntheir will, have exercised their right to live as a \nsovereign, independent nation, thus pursuing the path \nthat many of the Member States represented here today \nhave taken. \n The people of Nagorno Karabakh made the same \nchoice two decades ago by exercising their right to \n \n \n23 11-51185 \n \nself-determination, withstanding the war unleashed by \nAzerbaijan, and surviving bloodshed to earn their right \nto live in freedom. The Nagorno Karabakh conflict \nsettlement talks are continuing with the mediation of \nthe OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs. We are grateful to \nthe co-chair countries and their leaders for their \nmediation efforts. However, it is the negotiating \nparties, not the mediators, who have to reach an \nagreement. Azerbaijan\u2019s utter unwillingness to reach an \nagreement and its everything-or-war position have \nstalled progress in the peace talks. Despite the \nexpectations and high-level advice of the international \ncommunity, Azerbaijan took yet another step backward \nduring the last meeting in Kazan by rejecting the \npreviously formulated arrangement and in fact trying to \nmake the negotiation process break down. \n Baku has turned Armenophobia into State \npropaganda at a level that is way beyond dangerous. \nThat is not just our view; the alarm has also been \nsounded by international entities specializing in \ncombating racism and intolerance. Even more \ndangerously, Armenophobic ideas are spreading among \nthe young Azeri generation, imperilling the future of \npeaceful coexistence. By denying and destroying all \nthings Armenian, Baku stubbornly continues to \ndisseminate false accusations against Armenia, \nNagorno Karabakh and Armenians at all levels \neverywhere, including here, within the framework of \nthe United Nations. Azerbaijan\u2019s propaganda machine \ncontinues to regularly bombard the international \ncommunity and its domestic audience with horrendous \nlies about so-called Armenian brutality and the killing \nof children. These stories are fabricated and \ndisseminated based on their authors\u2019 shallow yet \npainful logic, which posits that there are some people \nout there who will rise to the bait of this evil \npropaganda against Armenia and that it will thus serve \na purpose. \n In recent years, owing to the efforts of the Minsk \nGroup co-chair countries, particularly direct mediation \non the part of the President of the Russian Federation, \na number of documents have been signed, including the \nMeindorf, Astrakhan and Sochi declarations, which \nhave stressed the need to strengthen confidence-\nbuilding measures between the parties. The signature \nof the President of Azerbaijan is also on those \ndocuments. Azerbaijan, however, continues to turn \ndown repeated proposals from the international \ncommunity concerning agreement on the non-use of \nforce and the strengthening of confidence-building \nmeasures. \n Moreover, Azerbaijan\u2019s belligerent rhetoric and \nthreats of war have intensified, and ceasefire violations \nthat continue to deprive innocent civilians of their lives \nhave grown more frequent. All of this is orchestrated at \nthe highest State level. The dangerous rise in \nmanifestations of Armenophobia not only does not \ncontribute to an atmosphere of trust in the region, but \nalso leads to questions about Azerbaijan\u2019s \nunderstanding of the United Nations goals of tolerance \nand good-neighbourly coexistence. With such \naspirations, it is impermissible and even dangerous to \naspire to membership in the Security Council. \n Yesterday, in the framework of the Assembly, \nalongside debates on some of the most vital and urgent \nissues of our time, a High-level meeting was convened \nyesterday on the tenth anniversary of the Durban \nDeclaration, which reiterated the urgent need to \neliminate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \nall forms of intolerance. Unfortunately, these \nphenomena are familiar to us Armenians not only from \nthe examples I mentioned earlier and not only from this \ncentury. As a nation that has survived genocide, the \nmost extreme form of racism and xenophobia, we are \nmorally obliged to act to prevent future genocides. \n The elimination of racism and xenophobia and \nthe inculcation of tolerance can be truly effective if \naccompanied by a clear prescription of liability. \nImpunity and the avoidance of accountability give birth \nto yet new crimes. Hence, it is incumbent upon the \ninternational community to identify and denounce \nwithout delay any expression of intolerance, especially \nin its extreme forms. \n The genocide of the Armenians perpetrated under \nthe Ottoman Empire has been recognized and \ncondemned by numerous countries, parliaments, \ninternational organizations and the community of \ngenocide scholars. Unfortunately, the same does not \nhold true for the Republic of Turkey, which continues \nto engage in a policy of denying this atrocious crime \nagainst humanity.  \n We unequivocally welcome the clear position \nadopted by the international community in precluding \nany possibility of immunity or pardon for the \nperpetrators of genocide and other crimes against \nhumanity. Without recognition and condemnation, it \nwill be impossible to develop and implement effective \n  \n \n11-51185 24 \n \nmechanisms of prevention, which is a United Nations \npriority. Armenia will contribute its utmost to the \nrecognition, punishment and prevention of genocide. \n These references to the Armenian genocide lead \nme to recall another important celebration marked this \nyear: the 150th birthday of Fridtjof Nansen, the first \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. In the most difficult \nperiod for my nation, that great humanist rendered \npriceless support to the survival of the homeland-\ndeprived fragments of the Armenian people who had \nfled the genocide. Holders of Nansen passports settled \nin various countries of the world. They rose to their \nfeet and partook in the development of the countries \nand peoples that offered them refuge. I believe that \njustice and equal rights between States have become \nstandards in international relations thanks to such \npowerful individuals, who promoted their vision of \nmorality in the cruel world of realpolitik. \n Speaking from this rostrum in 2008, I expressed \nthe hope that the Armenia-Turkey normalization \nprocess initiated by us, the establishment of diplomatic \nrelations and the opening of the borders closed by \nTurkey, in violation of international law, would become \nthe first steps towards the launch of a dialogue to \novercome the climate of mistrust, suspicion and \nuncertainty between us. Although our initiative was \ncommended and widely supported by the international \ncommunity, Turkey has in all ways possible aborted the \nratification and implementation of the protocols we \nsigned in 2009. \n Today, on the eve of the Rio United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development, political will \nmust be exerted to honour the international \ncommitments to convert the South Caucasus into a \nregion of cooperation and prosperity. \n The correlation between security and \ndevelopment is not an abstract theory for our region, \nwhere economic cooperation and deeper integration \nwith the global economy are hampered by unlawful \nblockades and the obstruction of regional integration \nprojects. Those attitudes, alongside the fuelling of an \narms race, not only pose a danger to the peoples of the \nregion, but also continue to drain the resources direly \nneeded for sustainable development. \n The time has come for the leaders of the countries \nof our region to stand above the dictates of narrow \npolitical agendas and to move towards solutions aimed \nat a peaceful and prosperous future for generations to \ncome. I want to believe that, in the not-too-distant \nfuture, our region will be perceived as a solid and firm \nbridge uniting civilizations, rather than as a dividing \nline. \n Two days ago, the Republic of Armenia \ncelebrated the twentieth anniversary of its \nindependence. In September 1991, Armenia restored its \nindependence, realizing the dream of the Armenian \npeople and reuniting with the family of nations. In the \nrealm of history, 20 years may seem like a short time, \nbut for the current generation it has served as a time of \ngreat change, with the building of independent \nstatehood and a renewed perception of its role and \nplace in the world. I take this opportunity to express \nmy gratitude to all the States, peoples and individuals \nthat have supported us in these 20 years of \ndevelopment and State-building. \n Freedom, peace and democracy are our choice, \nand we are committed to this path. We are proud of our \nachievements today. In two decades, the Republic of \nArmenia has implemented a wide-scale programme of \nState-building. Much has been done in the fields of \ndemocratization, the protection of human rights, \neconomic reform, and the establishment of the rule of \nlaw and a liberal economy. We have achieved much, \nbut much remains to be done. Above all, we are \nconvinced that we are on the right path \u2014 a path that is \nirreversible. \n Exactly a decade ago, New York, the city that is \nhome to the United Nations, experienced one of the \nworst atrocities in the history of humankind \u2014 the 9/11 \nterrorist attacks. Armenia unconditionally supports and \nactively contributes to the international community\u2019s \ncounter-terrorism efforts and all the initiatives of the \nUnited Nations in this area. We are doing and will \ncontinue to do our best to make the world a safer and \nmore peaceful place. \n We stand ready, to the best of our abilities, to \ncontribute to global security and respond to global \nthreats, be it through peacekeeping missions, the \nelimination of the consequences of natural disasters, \nenvironmental protection or the fight against terrorism, \nracism and intolerance. Over the years, we have proven \nour aspirations and determination with deeds, and we \nstand ready to continue doing the same."

        "file_text": "Samoa joined the \nUnited Nations 35 years ago, a decision rooted firmly \nin our belief in the principle of the sovereign equality \nof all Member States, each with the same rights and \nresponsibilities. That sentiment underpins our \n  \n \n11-51372 6 \n \nrelationship with our Organization as it evolves into a \nglobal family of interdependent nations. \n The Organization remains one of the last, if not \nthe greatest, bastion against the serious challenges and \nuncertainties that beset our world \u2014 financial and \neconomic crises, climate change, environmental \ndegradation, land desertification, ocean acidification, \ndestruction of fishery resources, endemic poverty and \ndangerous threats to peace and security. That is why we \ncontinue to support the United Nations and look to its \ntimely interventions and leadership in addressing the \nchallenges the world faces and finding collective \nsolutions to them. \n It is in the context of the leadership role of the \nUnited Nations that the visit of Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon earlier this month to the Pacific region as a \nspecial guest of the Pacific Leaders Forum in New \nZealand was particularly significant. The visit enabled \nthe Secretary-General to see first-hand the scale of the \nchallenges facing vulnerable Pacific small island \ncountries. The visit, the first ever to the Pacific by an \nincumbent Secretary-General in the 66 years of \nexistence of the United Nations, was a historical \nmilestone in the relationship between the Pacific region \nand the United Nations. The fact that the Secretary-\nGeneral is from the Asia-Pacific region and that the \nvisit took place before the start of his second term, not \nat the end of it, are positive aspects that were not lost \non the Pacific leaders. Mr. Ban Ki-moon\u2019s advocacy \nand support of Pacific issues in the different \ninternational forums dealing with sustainable \ndevelopment, climate change and peace and security, as \nwe witnessed on Wednesday when he presented his \nreport to the General Assembly, will be invaluable in \nplacing Pacific concerns at centre stage for attention \nand support where needed. \n The United Nations is the world\u2019s premier \nOrganization. Its role in the various areas of \ndevelopment and in improving the human condition \nmust be exemplary and unequivocal. The work and \ninfluence of the United Nations to encourage \nGovernments to respect and uphold fundamental \nhuman rights is sorely needed in parts of our Pacific \nregion and across the world. \n In our region as well, the work of the United \nNations to facilitate the choices of Pacific peoples to \nexercise their right to self-determination continues to \nform an important part of our Pacific region\u2019s \nassociation with the United Nations. In this respect, we \nstrongly urge the United Nations to play a more \nproactive role towards the achievement of this goal. \n Development, security and human rights are \nmutually reinforcing pillars of the United Nations. \nEqual progress on all three fronts should be the norm, \nnot the exception. A decade into the new millennium, \nwe find the Assembly meeting against the backdrop of \na world teetering on many fronts and replete with \nuncertainties. \n A full recovery of the global economy to \npre-2008 levels continues to be an elusive goal. The \nimmediate to medium-term outlook is not promising \nand does not instil confidence. While some \nGovernments are being assisted with their budgetary \ndifficulties, others, in contrast, are struggling on their \nown to provide the basic necessities for their people. \nAchieving the time-bound Millennium Development \nGoals in their totality is becoming difficult by the day. \n In terms of crises, be it economic, climate change \nor food-related, the most and worst affected by any one \nof these are, without exception, some of the United \nNations \u2014 recognized vulnerable groups \u2014 the least \ndeveloped countries and the small island developing \nStates. Samoa belongs to both categories. Though the \nUnited Nations has committed, through internationally \nagreed development frameworks such as the Brussels \nProgramme of Action, the Barbados Programme of \nAction and others, to help vulnerable economies attain \neconomic growth, sustainable development and the \nresilience to endure external shocks, the reality is that \nthe needs of these groups always outstrip the resources \navailable to them. This mismatch is due in part to \nundercapitalized frameworks with no dedicated \nfunding. \n Earlier this week, the United Nations focused \nlong-overdue attention on the insidious health threat \nposed by non-communicable diseases (NCDs). If left \nunchecked, NCDs will not only devastate the health of \nour people but also have the potential to wreak havoc \nin our economies, with the incidence of these so-called \nlifestyle diseases having a heavy impact on the \nproductive population. Samoa therefore adds its voice \nto the call to include the reduction of non-communicable \ndiseases in the Millennium Development Goals and \nwhich sufficient resources and donor partnership \nactions should also prioritize. \n \n \n7 11-51372 \n \n These are real concerns. Sustainable economic \ndevelopment is a priority issue for Samoa and the \nPacific island countries. This is why we are hopeful \nthat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20), to be held next June in Brazil, \nwill allow for a serious discussion and reorientation of \nthe whole United Nations community on the \nimportance of identifying and providing the necessary \nresources for the implementation of the agreed \nprogrammes of action and other global arrangements \nthat the United Nations underwrites. \n The theme of this year\u2019s Pacific Forum was \n\u201cConverting potential into prosperity\u201d. In line with this \nis the advocacy led by the Pacific countries to raise the \nprofile of the oceans agenda towards a strong \u201cblue \neconomy\u201d outcome, to ensure that the importance of \nthe oceans to our islands is captured as an integral \ncomponent of the Rio+20 outcome. The ocean provides \nthe Pacific region with opportunities and challenges, \nbest reflected in the four-pronged focus on \nconservation, sustainable management, balanced \nharvesting and greater economic return from the \nutilization of fishery and marine resources. \n The emphasis of efforts on maximizing economic \nbenefits from fisheries is a recognition of its vital \ncontribution in supporting sustainable economic \ndevelopment and attempts to address the long-held \nconcern of Pacific islands that they have been for far \ntoo long short-changed and unfairly compensated for \nthe fishery resources found within our waters, which \nare worth many billions of dollars, with less than 1 per \ncent received by the island countries. \n The Pacific States have long been committed to \nefforts to conserve and manage fisheries resources in \nthe region. It has therefore also been a point of long-\nstanding frustration that vessels of major fishing \nnations continue to fish illegally in Pacific waters. \nEven when they are caught carrying out illegal fishing \nactivities, it is by no means a certainty that prosecution \nand enforcement of penalties will be successful, when \ninfringing fishing vessels have heavy financial \nresources backing their defences. \n We therefore again urge cooperation from all \nnations with fishing fleets in the Pacific to work \ntogether with our Pacific countries to stop illegal, \nunreported and unregulated fishing practices in the \nPacific. The Pacific carries the last major stocks of \nsome key fish species that in other oceans have already \nbeen depleted, contaminated and devastated. \nSuccessful conservation and the effective management \nof harvest levels in the long term is absolutely critical, \nnot just for Pacific countries and distant-water fishing \nnations, but, ultimately, the availability of fish supplies \nto the rest of the world in the years ahead. The \nsuccessful conservation and management of fish stocks \nin the Pacific is, pure and simple, good business for \neveryone. \n Climate change was again singled out by Pacific \nleaders during their just-concluded summit as the \nsingle greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and \nwell-being of the peoples of the Pacific. Natural \ncatastrophes are capable of destruction that devastates \nentire communities. From the tragic experiences that \nour country has endured, we know of the great pain \nfrom the loss of lives, the destruction of property and \nthe setback to the national economy that disasters are \ncapable of inflicting. \n It is therefore imperative that adequate resources \nbe available and that they may, indeed, be accessed \nwith ease through different direct modalities in order to \nassist countries in meeting their mitigation and \nadaptation programmes. The Copenhagen Green \nClimate Fund is now in the design phase. The \nrepresentatives of Governments and experts involved \nwould do well to pay attention to the existing climate \nchange funding architecture so that the shortcomings of \nother funding mechanisms are not repeated. \n Without the necessary financial resources and \ntechnical support, Samoa\u2019s ability to adapt to and \nmitigate climate change will be severely curtailed. \nThankfully, Samoa continues to benefit under the fast \nstart finance window, both bilaterally and through \nregional projects made available by the generous \nsupport of our traditional and new development \npartners, such as Australia, China, the European Union, \nJapan, New Zealand, Italy, the Asian Development \nBank, the Global Environment Facility, the World Bank \nand the United Nations, to name but a few. We are, \nindeed, very, very grateful. \n Countries in different parts of the world look to \nthe United Nations and its stronger members for \npeacekeeping arrangements to give those communities \nin strife time to re-establish and to find lasting \nsolutions. Samoa continues to lend its unwavering \nsupport to that aspect of the United Nations mandate. I \nreaffirm that support, which is underpinned by my \n  \n \n11-51372 8 \n \ncountry\u2019s contribution and the involvement of our \npolice officers in the United Nations peacekeeping \noperations in the Sudan, Liberia and Timor-Leste. \nAdditionally, Samoa continues to be an integral part of \nthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \nunder the umbrella of the Pacific Forum. \n Samoa warmly welcomes the admission of South \nSudan as the United Nation\u2019s newest member in July \nthis year. \n Samoa joins the international community\u2019s \nsupport for the courage of the people of Tunisia, Egypt, \nLibya and now Syria in seeking relief from oppression \nand in gaining the freedoms and human rights to which \nthey are rightly entitled. \n At this rostrum a year ago, I did not expect the \nArab spring, and spoke in earnest of the hope that \nprogress would come in the then historic process to \nbring permanent peace to the peoples of Israel and \nPalestine (see A/65/PV.19). It is our long-held \nconviction that an independent Palestinian nation, \ntaking its rightful place in our global family and living \nside by side with a secure Israel, is the only road to \npermanent peace. However, while we all know that that \nis the sensible outcome that must be achieved, it will \nsadly remain elusive without a clear sense of \ncommitment and willingness by both sides to negotiate \nin good faith. \n For genuine and permanent peace between \nPalestine and the State of Israel, there must be direct \nnegotiations between the two countries. Addressing the \nsymptoms, but not the root causes of the conflict is \nshort-sighted and the result unsustainable. Solutions \nmust be decided by the two parties, not imposed from \noutside. Without that strong buy-in from the Israelis \nand Palestinians themselves, any solutions will, at best, \nbe short-lived. More than ever, visionary leadership, on \nboth sides, that sees beyond the immediate dictates of \nshort-sighted interests and that is, instead, willing to \nseize the opportunity to fashion a just and durable \npeace settlement, is critically needed at this point. \n Terrorism, in its various forms and \nmanifestations, is responsible for the horror and fear \nthat have continued to grip the world\u2019s attention. No \ncountry is immune from the reaches of terrorism, and \nwe are all affected to varying degrees. Terrorist acts \ncommitted under whatever pretext or purpose can \nnever be justified as morally acceptable. Equally, \ncountering terrorism does not confer immunity from \nthe rule of law, nor the abandonment of the principles \nof a civilized society. \n No country can win the war against terrorism on \nits own. Only by pooling our resources and working \ncollaboratively with each other can we stand a chance \nof defeating that senseless menace. Samoa, despite the \nheavy cost, is doing its best to meet our obligations in \nthat collective effort. \n Modest progress has been achieved in the efforts \nto reform the Security Council. Samoa remains \nconvinced that an expanded Security Council that \nmirrors present-day realities is essential for \nmultilateralism and for the Council\u2019s integrity and \ncredibility. Increases in both the permanent and the \nnon-permanent categories should be part and parcel of \nthe reform package."

        "file_text": "Permit me to extend hearty \ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at this session. May \nI also use this opportunity to express our sincere thanks \nto your predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for the able \nmanner in which he presided over the sixty-fifth \nsession. \n Ghana joins the rest of the world in welcoming \nour sister country, South Sudan, to the family of the \nUnited Nations. It is our fervent hope that South \nSudan, having taken its rightful place in this body, will \ngrow and prosper. We also want to congratulate the \nSecretary-General on his appointment to a second term. \nIt is a clear manifestation of his excellent performance \nduring his first term. \n It is a long-established fact that United Nations \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding activities have \ncontributed immensely to the Organization\u2019s efforts for \nthe maintenance of international peace and security \nover the years. We observe, however, that this activity \ncontinues to take on complex dimensions that require \nlong-term planning and urgent reforms in order to \nenable the United Nations to tackle the challenges that \ncrop up.  \n It is in this connection that Ghana reaffirms its \nsupport for the ongoing reform agenda being \nundertaken by the United Nations in consultation with \nthe troop- and police-contributing countries. However, \nwe do want to emphasize that regular tripartite \nconsultations are needed among the United Nations, \nthe Secretariat, the Security Council and the troop- and \npolice-contributing countries. \n As one of the top contributors of police and \ntroops to United Nations activities, Ghana remains \nunwavering in its commitment to the ideals and \nobjectives of the United Nations. Accordingly, I want \nto assure Members that as long as financial, human and \nmaterial capacities exist at the national level, Ghana \nwill continue to provide troops and police personnel \nfor United Nations operations.  \n But it is important that the burden and costs to \nthe United Nations of these activities be equitably \nshared among Member States. We think that countries \nsuch as Ghana that provide troops and police personnel \nfor these operations must be financially supported by \ndonor countries in a timely manner. We are aware of \n  \n \n11-51185 2 \n \nthe financial constraints existing at all national levels, \nbut we want to encourage Member States to meet their \nobligations to the United Nations so that the \nOrganization can execute its mandate. \n Allow me to pay tribute to all United Nations \npersonnel \u2014 including those from my own country, \nGhana \u2014 who in the course of the year made the \nultimate sacrifice while on United Nations \npeacekeeping missions. May their souls rest in peace \nand their sacrifice be cherished and remembered. \n Another issue that we are following with keen \ninterest is the proposed arms trade treaty. Ghana fully \nsupports this and thinks it is necessary. Hence our \nsatisfaction thus far with the outcomes of the meetings \nof the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations \nConference on the Arms Trade Treaty held in New \nYork last year and in February and March this year.  \n As a nation, we consider a strong and effective \narms trade treaty to be an indispensable step in \npreventing the flow of arms to destinations where they \ncan cause mayhem and wreak havoc by fuelling \nconflicts that may in turn undermine national and \nregional peace, security and development, or \nexacerbate tensions that in the long run may create \nsituations that need the deployment of United Nations \npeacekeepers.  \n For developing countries such as Ghana, the \nillicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons \nand other conventional weaponry continues to pose a \nserious threat to our national security and to our \nsocio-economic and political stability, given the \nlinkage to other crimes such as terrorism, organized \ncrime, drug trading and indeed human trafficking, \namong others. It is therefore imperative that the \nremaining meetings of the arms trade treaty \nPreparatory Committee produce proposals that would \nclose the loopholes that allow the flow of these \nweapons from legitimate to illicit markets. \n The United Nations reached a significant \nmilestone with the launch of UN-Women \u2014 the United \nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women. It is critical as member \nStates of the international community that we break \ngender stereotypes, which after all are the root cause of \nthe myriad of gender-inequality challenges facing us \nthroughout the world. Ghana\u2019s efforts are focused on \naddressing gender imbalances and misconceptions and \non improving the living conditions of women and girls, \nbearing in mind that in solving the gender issue we \nwould be taking concrete steps towards the attainment \nof a majority of the Millennium Development Goals. It \nis our expectation that the objectives of UN-Women \nwill be met. \n On the occasion of the High-level Meeting to \ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the Durban \nDeclaration and Programme of Action, Ghana \nrecognizes the progress so far made in this area by the \nopportunity given to Member States to reaffirm and \nstrengthen their political commitment to the prevention \nof and fight against racism and racial discrimination in \nall its forms. We are confident that the effective \nimplementation of the outcome policy (see resolution \n66/3) will indeed ensure the enjoyment of human rights \nand fundamental freedoms by all, including the victims \nof racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \nrelated intolerance, in all societies. \n It is noteworthy that the High-level Meeting of \nthe General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of \nNon-communicable Diseases focused on the developmental \ndrawbacks and socio-economic impact on developing \ncountries where the relevant facilities are not available. \nIndeed, we are of the opinion that the effective \nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \nnot only helps to reduce poverty but also decreases \nhealth-care costs, thereby improving productivity and \nultimately helping with rapid economic development.  \n Efforts in Ghana to improve the health-care \nsystem include the completion of the health-care \ninfrastructure in several parts of the country, the \nscaling-up of the National Ambulance Service to cover \nall districts and the training of emergency medical \ntechnicians. We have re-engineered our policies in \norder to give more meaning to health-care delivery. \n Ghana recognizes and appreciates the \ncontribution of youth to nation-building and the growth \nand sustenance of our democracy. We believe that the \nadoption of the political declaration urging Member \nStates to adopt comprehensive plans and measures to \ngive meaning to youth development is commendable, \nespecially since this is the International Year of Youth. \nIn Ghana we are implementing policies that are \nintended to situate young men and women in the centre \nof nation-building.  \n One of the main reasons for our relentless fight \nagainst drug trafficking is to ensure that we secure the \nfuture of our young men and women, who, after all, \n \n \n3 11-51185 \n \nwill be the future leaders of our dear nations. As we \ncontinue to invest heavily in our youth by expanding \neducational opportunities and making it possible for \nthe disadvantaged to have access to formal schooling, \nwe believe we are laying the right foundation. The \nprovision of free school uniforms, free exercise books \nand the elimination of more than one thousand schools \nunder trees, turning them into brick-and-mortar \nstructures, should be ample evidence of our \ndetermination to brighten the future of youth. Certainly \nGhana\u2019s oil and gas find should present us with a \ngreater opportunity to create the conditions under \nwhich we will be able to create more jobs to solve \nyouth unemployment in our country. \n Climate change is the defining human \ndevelopment challenge of the twenty-first century and \none of the greatest threats to sustainable development \nin Africa. Although as a continent we contribute only \n4 per cent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, we \nare the most vulnerable when it comes to climate \nchange. Therefore urgent and concerted action is \nneeded to enable us to maximize the opportunity that \nclimate change offers. \n We believe that with the right investments in \ntechnology, institutions and infrastructure by the \ninternational community and nation-States, we will be \nable to unleash the potential of agriculture, harness the \nmaximum benefit from water resources, expand access \nto modern energy sources, fight diseases and conserve \ntropical forests.  \n As we move closer to the climate change \nnegotiations scheduled for Durban, South Africa, it is \nour expectation that the critical political questions that \ncould not be answered during the United Nations \nClimate Change Conference at Canc\u00fan will be \naddressed. With regard to mitigation, we believe that \nwe need political commitment, a high sense of \nflexibility and strong leadership to ensure that at the \nDurban Conference the second round of commitments \nunder the Kyoto Protocol will be addressed or some \ntransitional arrangement made.  \n Again with regard to mitigation, we believe that \nall pledged commitments and actions should be \nquantified, monitored and verified by the international \ncommunity. We commend the obvious progress made \nin the design of the institutions of adaptation, such as \nthe Green Climate Fund. What remains to be done is to \ndetermine the sources of funding for the Fund and also \nto empower the Conference of Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change to \nhave control over the Green Climate Fund. \n On the political and security fronts, Ghana \nnotices a paradigm shift, or at least a shift in emphasis, \nfrom national security to human security. We agree that \ninterventions targeted on human security will \neventually define our national security. We are \ntherefore implementing measures that will help us \nmake this concept take form through the adoption of \nthe necessary legislative measures, institutions and \nreforms. We are taking steps to expand our adherence \nto the rule of law, the promotion of transparency and \ngood governance, the maintenance of the independence \nand integrity of the judiciary, and the promotion of a \nfree media. We also subscribe to the global norm of the \nresponsibility to protect, and we promise to work hand \nin glove with member countries, the United Nations \nand others to achieve this. \n A little over a year from now Ghana will be going \nto the polls to elect a President and Members of \nParliament for another four years. To ensure that the \nelections are free, fair, transparent and credible, our \nElectoral Commission \u2014 which has successfully organized \nthe last three elections, since the year 2000 \u2014 has put in \nplace the necessary measures to enable Ghanaians to \nmake their choices in a free atmosphere. Our \ndemocratic credentials stand tall, and we would not \nwant anything to affect the standard that we have \nachieved. \n Just as the United Nations and the rest of the \ninternational community kept an eye on the 2008 \nelections in Ghana, I should like to invite you, \nMr. President, and all others to come and do the same \nin connection with the 2012 elections. We want to \nmake sure that people are given the right to vote and \nchoose their own leaders, instead of having leaders \nimposed on them or come in through unauthorized \nmeans. \n Finally, I wish to reaffirm Ghana\u2019s total \ncommitment to the aims, objectives and ideals of the \nUnited Nations. I also want to advocate that all \nMember States muster the necessary political will to \nensure that the United Nations functions more \neffectively. "

        "file_text": "Twelve months ago, I \nstood here and insisted upon the importance of the \nprinciple of accountability. This year there is even \nmore reason to underscore this core value in national \nand international politics. \n In several countries of the Arab world \u2014 in \nTunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, Syria, Yemen and \nelsewhere \u2014 people are transforming the outlook of \ntheir societies, moving towards more accountable \nleadership. \n On the African continent, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire a \nleader who repeatedly plunged his country into \nviolence did not stand the test of democratic \nlegitimacy. With parliamentary elections scheduled to \ntake place later this year, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is now ready to \nmake a fresh start. \n And in Europe the arrest of Ratko Mladic \nconfirms what leaders should know all too well: that \nwar crimes will not remain unpunished for ever, that \nthis world will not accept impunity. \n The past year has shown that, more than ever, \nhistory is on the side of those who, worldwide, strive \nfor more accountability. They will find Belgium on \ntheir side. \n Accountability means first of all legal \naccountability: the obligation to implement \ninternational treaties and to respect international law. A \nformer Nuremberg prosecutor, Benjamin Ferencz, \nstated, \u201cThere can be no peace without justice, no \njustice without law and no meaningful law without a \nCourt to decide what is just and lawful under any given \ncircumstance\u201d. \n Some of the examples I have just mentioned \nillustrate that all too well. Ratko Mladic is on trial in \nThe Hague. Mass atrocities committed in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \nand Libya have been referred to the International \nCriminal Court. \n From this place, I would like to launch a strong \nappeal to those Member States that have not yet done \nso to adhere to and shoulder the Rome Statute, as a \ncontribution to a sustainable and accountable \ninternational legal system. \n But accountability is of course much broader. It \nalso implies political accountability. Governments, \n \n \n5 11-51378 \n \npoliticians and civil servants are accountable and \nresponsible to their citizens, be it through the ballot \nbox or through constructive engagement with \nrepresentative organizations. \n Let me be frank: this is also a challenge in the \ncontinent I come from, Europe. We, as European \nleaders, should not run away from the obligation of \nbeing accountable to the people we represent. In the \nDurban spirit of non-discrimination, let me add: \naccountable to all the people, regardless of their ethnic \nbackground, their religion or belief, their gender, \nsexual orientation or social position. \n Worldwide, the challenges are sometimes of a \ndifferent order. Let us be clear. Leaders who believe \nthat they can cling to power through terror and \nsuppression make a cruel mistake. Leaders who believe \nthat pointing guns at their own people, that sending \ndeath squads on to the streets, that stoning women to \ndeath is acceptable, have lost touch with humankind \nand are bound to lose all support, not only from their \nown people but also from the world. \n Warlords who think that they can get away with \nsexual abuse of women and recruiting child soldiers \nshould be stopped and held accountable by a united \nand firm international community. \n Belgium will not stand idly by when people claim \na future free of coercion and terror. Instead of \nnon-interference, Belgium believes in non-indifference. \nSovereignty cannot be a wall that leaders can use to \nviolate the rights of their citizens. Sovereignty cannot \nbe used as an excuse to run away from the \nresponsibility to protect their people. \n This is one of the main lessons that I draw from \nrecent events in the Arab world: that democracy and \naccountability are of a universal nature; that they \ncannot be claimed, and should not be claimed, by any \nnation or group of nations. \n Take the case of Libya, where the Security \nCouncil was able to prevent a massacre in Benghazi. \nBelgium decided, with almost unanimous support in \nParliament, to take part in the military Operation \nUnified Protector, assuming the risk and the cost.  \n That was because Belgium is convinced that the \ninternational community has the responsibility to take \naction when populations are exposed to imminent \ndanger. Moli\u00e8re said long ago that we are responsible \nnot only for what we do, but for what we do not do.  \n Today, now that the immediate danger is fading, \nthe international community has a responsibility to \nhelp in the reconstruction of Libya. Let us not forget \nthat that responsibility is an integral part of the \nresponsibility to protect. Belgium will contribute.  \n Let us look at the rest of the African continent, \nwhose peoples want their voice to be heard through \nfree and fair elections. In that context, I wish to make \nspecific mention of the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, where, after years of violence, undeniable \nprogress has been made.  \n The important part played by the United Nations, \nand in particular by the United Nations Organization \nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, cannot be ignored.  \n There are still significant challenges to be \novercome. They include the continuation and \nstrengthening of stabilization efforts in the east of \ncountry, the reform of the security sector, the \nestablishment of the rule of law and countering \nimpunity and sexual violence.  \n Those are essential ingredients in the \nconsolidation of democracy. The 2006 elections put the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the road to \ndemocracy. The elections to be held at the end of \nNovember should confirm that the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo is ready once and for all to \nmove on from its bloody past.  \n As an important partner of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, my Government is contributing \nfinancially to the preparations for the elections, and \ndemands that every candidate and every citizen be able \nto participate peacefully and with full respect for \ndemocratic rules.\n Let us finally look at the Middle East, a conflict \nregion that has this week received much attention here \nin the Hall. Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, to whom this week is \ndedicated and who himself devoted much of his effort \nto finding a lasting peace in that region, said more than \nhalf a century ago: \u201cThe building of a firm bridge \u2026 \nover which you can pass without any difficulties may \nbe a long story\u201d. More than 50 years later, we still do \nnot have such a \u201cfirm bridge\u201d. That is not acceptable.  \n  \n \n11-51378 6 \n \n The parameters of a sustainable solution are well \nknown. Both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples have \nlegitimate aspirations. People want statehood. People \nwant to live in peace and security. These were the \nmessages that President Abbas and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu brought us yesterday. It must be possible to \nsatisfy both legitimate needs. \n Over the past few months, the European Union \nand its High Representative have spared no effort to \nget a process of negotiations started. There is no \nalternative to negotiations, however difficult and risky \nthe path may be. It is therefore my sincere hope that \nthe steps proposed by the Quartet yesterday will be \nfully implemented. \n It is also clear that the Palestinian Authority has \nsuccessfully progressed on the road to statehood, also \nthanks to the important and sustained contributions by \nthe European Union and by Belgium, and that it has \nnow reached a level of statehood that the world cannot \nignore. \n Now is the time to show leadership. After all, that \nis what accountability towards the people of the region \nis all about. \n Many have said it before: the global challenges \nwe face are multiple. They range from terrorism to \nclimate change and sustainable development \u2014 in \nwhich regard the upcoming United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development will ask a lot of our \nenergy and creativity in the months ahead; from \nfinancial turmoil to terrible humanitarian tragedies like \nthe one in the Horn of Africa; from banning cluster \nmunitions to curbing nuclear proliferation, notably in \nNorth Korea and Iran; from guaranteeing the \nresponsible and transparent exploitation of natural \nresources through schemes such as the Kimberley \nProcess; through to fully implementing the indicators \nof the landmark Security Council resolution 1325 \n(2000) on women, peace and security. \n For Belgium, the only way to address those \nchallenges is through a multilateral approach. No \ncountry, however big or important, is capable of \ntackling global challenges alone. No country, however \nmodest in size it may be, should think that it cannot be \npart of the solution. \n Multilateralism is not about blocking solutions. It \nshould lead to change, and should have at its centre the \nUnited Nations, which indeed has proved its added \nvalue in so many fields. Let me mention just one such \nfield to which Belgium attaches particular importance: \ninternational conflict mediation. \n When the Secretary-General addressed us earlier \nthis week he mentioned Guinea, Kenya and Kyrgyzstan \nas United Nations mediation successes. The list is \nundoubtedly longer, but so are the needs. I am \ntherefore grateful to the President of the General \nAssembly for choosing mediation as a central theme \nfor our debate. I strongly believe that the United \nNations should continue to invest in strengthening its \nmediation capacities. \n I am proud to announce that Belgium has decided \nto financially support the United Nations Mediation \nSupport Unit and to actively engage with the President \nand with other Governments and non-governmental \nstakeholders to strengthen the role of United Nations \nmediation efforts. \n Some say that the United Nations is losing its \npower as a global platform for discussion and decision-\nmaking. Some say that global trends point towards a \nmore fragmented structure of global governance. I do \nnot think that that is true. I would certainly not think \nthat it was desirable. \n Belgium remains a staunch supporter of the \nUnited Nations. Our current engagement in the \nPeacebuilding Commission and our bid for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nperiod 2019-2020 show our willingness to play our role \nin the United Nations. \n Today I am also proud to introduce Belgium\u2019s \ncandidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period \n2015-2018, to add our voice to those who fight \nimpunity and discrimination; to give a voice to those \nmen, women and children who worldwide see their \nrights curtailed; to turn the principle of non-\nindifference into a living reality. That is not for the \nsake of ourselves, but for the sake of those to whom we \nare accountable."

        "file_text": "Allow me \nto warmly congratulate the President on his accession \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsixth session. With his experience and expertise we are \nindeed assured of the successful conduct and outcome \nof our deliberations. I express my gratitude to his \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his efficiency and \nthe excellent manner in which he guided our work \nthroughout the sixty-fifth session. We wish him well in \nhis future endeavours.  \n I also extend my warmest congratulations to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. \nThat is a token of the esteem that all States have for his \noutstanding leadership, especially in these turbulent \ntimes and the difficult international political situation. \nWe appreciate his tireless efforts and commitment to \nserve the international community, and we pledge our \nfull support in carrying out and promoting the \nfundamental values of the Charter.  \n Lastly, we are delighted at the long-awaited \ncreation of the United Nations Entity for Gender \nEquality and the Empowerment of Women, which \n \n \n17 11-51185 \n \nannounces the remarkable progress that has been made \nduring the past century in the quest for gender equality \nand empowerment of women. Clearly, despite the great \nstrides made in legal matters, it is still true that such \nprogress is not always translated into reality. My \nGovernment has made strengthening women\u2019s rights \nand improving their lives absolute priorities, and I am \ncommitted to ensuring that our laws conform to \ninternational standards. \n We are gathered here today in a global economic \ncontext that is more than worrying. This difficult world \neconomic environment is indeed reflected in weak \neconomies, declining growth, crippling debts and \ndeficits and rising unemployment. The least developed \ncountries are more severely affected by these crises. \nThe Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least \nDeveloped Countries, held recently in Turkey, gave \nnew impetus to global efforts to improve the fate of the \nmost vulnerable nations. From this perspective I invite \nthe international community to pay special attention to \nthe unique situation of least developed countries and to \nprovide more support in alleviating the growing burden \nof debt by assisting them to improve their production \ncapacity and facilitating access to world markets on \nmore favourable terms.  \n Coupled with the economic malaise, we are \nwitnessing throughout the world increasing climatic \ndisparities that range from one extreme to another. It is \nnow very common for countries to be hit by floods \nfollowed by droughts, and by earthquakes, devastating \nhurricanes or tsunamis. The catastrophe that recently \nhit our Japanese friends testifies to nature\u2019s ferocity. \nThe recurrence of these climate plagues shows us that \nwe must better prepare ourselves and set up appropriate \nmitigation and adaptation measures. \n In the Horn of Africa the uncertainties of the \nclimate have long been a fact of life, as evidenced by \nthe recurrent cycles of drought. The current crisis \naffecting my country is not sudden. We had already \nsounded the alarm in 2010, when the first warning \nsigns appeared. Faced with this terrible scourge, the \nresilience of the region is strained, and emergency \nmeasures alone cannot meet the challenges now \nconfronting us. Indeed, the situation we face today is \nthe result of several years of drought that have \ndecimated the herds of nomadic peoples and destroyed \ntheir meagre crops. People in rural areas are obviously \nthe most affected, and we are doing our best to help \nthem.  \n Our needs are immediate and urgent, and we are \ngrateful to the friendly countries and international \norganizations that have assisted us in our efforts. \nHowever, given the endemic nature of the drought in \nour region, we need to go beyond reactive management \nand focus more on managing long-term preventative \nmeasures. In this context my country has established \nseveral infrastructure projects in agriculture, including \nthe exploitation of arable lands in the neighbouring \nfriendly countries of Ethiopia and the Sudan, and the \nRiver Awash water catchment project on the border \nwith Ethiopia for times of floods.  \n The country most affected by this crisis remains \nSomalia, because the precarious security situation does \nnot allow access to certain populations. Indeed, over \nthe past two decades, Somalia has been a victim of the \nworst evils. It has been the victim of endless \nbloodshed, insecurity, instability and destruction. Until \nrecently Al-Shabaab militia continued fighting in the \ncapital, which made it all the more difficult to help the \naffected population. Today, thanks to the diligence and \nsacrifices of the Somali security forces and their \ncolleagues from the African Union Mission in Somalia, \nAl-Shabaab militia have been pushed out of the capital, \nand that has facilitated the delivery of humanitarian aid \nto drought victims. \n As I was able to see for myself during my visit to \nMogadishu last month, the guns have fallen silent, life \nhas resumed its course and this year, for the first time \nsince the armed conflict began in 1991, Somalis were \nable to celebrate Eid in peace. Numerous high-level \nofficials have since visited the Somali capital, which \nhad long been considered too dangerous.  \n This still-fragile but auspicious peace is an \nopportunity for the Somali people to rebuild their \ncountry. Thanks to the security situation, which is now \nunder control in the capital, the Somali people and \ntheir leaders have before them an unprecedented \nopportunity to revive a lasting peace, to stop the \ninterminable transition process and to move the \ncountry to a permanent governance by next year. \nEfforts have been made in this direction by the \nTransitional Government as well as by regional and \ninternational organizations. These have helped parties \nto reach an agreement that reflects the new political \nreality in Somalia, especially after the month of August \n2011.  \n  \n \n11-51185 18 \n \n All these efforts should be applauded as a sign of \nthe determination of the Somalis and of the \ninternational community to end the endless infighting \nand fruitless discussions within the Transitional \nFederal Institutions. In this regard the agreed road map \nrepresents a solemn commitment by the leaders of the \nTransitional Federal Institutions to the people of \nSomalia, the regional bodies and the international \ncommunity as a whole.  \n The international community, for its part, must \nnot lose sight of the obvious weaknesses of the \nTransitional Government and should endeavour to \nprovide the necessary resources to build capacity. The \nSomali Government should take this opportunity to \nshow determination, courage and leadership. \n Beyond the rigours of the climate and problems \nthey generate, the Horn of Africa is often associated \nwith fratricidal wars. Indeed, at one point in its history \neach of our neighbours has been in a conflict situation. \nWhile Djibouti has spared no effort to maintain peace, \nin spite of ourselves we were unfortunately dragged \ninto a border conflict with Eritrea in June 2008.  \n Since then, despite the best efforts of regional \nand international organizations and the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolutions 1862 (2009) and 1907 \n(2009), Eritrea refuses to answer us about the fate of \n19 prisoners of war or even to acknowledge their \nexistence. This remains a serious concern and a source \nof great sadness for my people and myself.  \n However, despite Eritrea\u2019s failure to comply with \nthe clear requirements set forth in those resolutions, \nmy Government and I remain convinced that mediation \nis the only way that will allow us to achieve a lasting \npeace. With this conviction in mind, my Government \nhas accepted the efforts and goodwill of His Highness \nthe Emir of Qatar. That led to the stationing of Qatari \ntroops on the border between Djibouti and Eritrea and \nthe withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the Djibouti \nterritory they had illegally occupied. For our part, we \nremain willing to cooperate fully with the sincere \nefforts of His Highness the Emir of Qatar, and we \nremain confident of the peaceful outcome of this \nmediation. \n We will never stop believing in the virtues of \ndialogue and mediation, the only virtues that can \nenable our region to consolidate the gains of peace. \nThe most recent example of such success is \nundoubtedly the birth of the new nation of South \nSudan, once again demonstrating the ability of our \npeers to find a peaceful solution to a decades-old \nfratricidal conflict. Today, as the people of South \nSudan take their first steps in the comity of nations, we \nwant to assure them of our fraternal support. I am \nconfident that they will resolve the outstanding issues \npeacefully. \n Of course, we can only rejoice that a new \nMember has joined the Organization, but I could not \nmention the independence of South Sudan without \nrecalling the situation that has prevailed in Palestine \nsince 1947.  \n The very foundation of the United Nations \nconsisted in fighting injustice and giving nations their \nsovereignty. Many countries here today, including \nmine, have at some point in their history found \nthemselves here in search of independence. South \nSudan became the 193rd Member State on 13 July. \nPalestine, for its part, continues to this day to live \nunder occupation, which in this day and age is morally \nwrong and politically unsustainable.  \n We Africans know better than anyone the \nconditions in which colonized populations live. The \nfate experienced by the Palestinians for more than \n60 years we have known, we have fought and we have \novercome by obtaining the recognition of our peers. \nMore than any other institution, for colonized peoples \nthe United Nations represented hope: the hope for a \nbetter future, freed from the colonial yoke; the hope to \nlive in one\u2019s own country, enjoying freedom and one\u2019s \nrights; the hope, above all, to regain dignity.  \n The time has come for us to give hope to our \nPalestinian brothers and sisters by recognizing their \nright to become a full-fledged State. It is time to end \nthe siege, the poverty and the despair. History will \nremember, I hope, that on this day we decided to end \nthe injustice and made the choice to finally give to \nPalestine a full place in the international community. \nHistory will especially remember that we have chosen \nnot to disappoint the hopes of the fraternal people of \nPalestine."

        "file_text": "This year the session of the General \nAssembly is opening at a time when international \nrelations are in a state of turbulence. The Middle East \nand North Africa have gone through a period of large-\nscale changes, and the situation is volatile in certain \nother parts of the world. We have not yet been able to \nput the global economy back on the track of \nprogressive sustainable development. The increasing \nnumber of alarming factors has been accompanied by \nan exacerbation of social, inter-ethnic and intercultural \nconflicts as well as outbreaks of extremism. \n Just as a ship caught in adverse weather \nconditions needs a united crew and a compass to find \nthe right course, the international community today \nneeds in particular to deploy joint efforts to respond to \ncommon challenges and set clear guidelines to \nstrengthen global governance mechanisms. We are \nconvinced that such guidelines should include, first and \nforemost, the rule of international law; clear, strict and \nresponsible reliance on the fundamental principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations; and the will to \nimplement a positive unification agenda. \n The United Nations remains a pillar of \ninternational relations and equitable multilateral \ncooperation in the interests of all States. It has a unique \nlegitimacy and the necessary authority to respond \nadequately to the variety of contemporary risks and \nthreats. It is the United Nations that should continue to \nprovide political, legal and moral leadership in dealing \nwith global challenges, to establish equitable principles \nand standards of interaction, to monitor their \nimplementation and to render necessary assistance and \nsupport for the States that need it. \n Ten years ago on September 11, a horrible \nterrorist attack was committed in this city. We are \nconvinced that it is necessary to strengthen multilateral \ncooperation in countering international terrorism on \nboth the global and regional levels. However, the \nadditional mechanisms to be created in this area should \nbe incorporated in our common work within the United \nNations, with due account taken of its central \ncoordinating role in combating terrorism. \n Wide international cooperation is needed to keep \nthe situation in the global economic and financial \nsystem under control. One can hardly deny the \nimportance of the role that the Group of Twenty (G-20) \nplays in the post-crisis recovery of the world economy. \nToday, it is important to finalize the process of \nreforming the global financial and economic \narchitecture and to implement everything we have \nagreed on, rather than to stop halfway. The efficiency \nof these efforts will only grow if the G-20 strengthens \nits dialogue with the United Nations and its specialized \nagencies.  \n A significant contribution to the reform of the \nglobal economy and finance is being made by \nBRICS \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South \nAfrica \u2014 a global-scale association of five major, \nrapidly growing economies that reflects the realities of \nthe evolving multipolar world. BRICS does not aim at \nconfrontation with anyone. Its goal is to enhance \nproductive multilateral collaboration to address the \nurgent problems of the contemporary world. \n Sustainable development requires a reliable \nsupply of energy resources for the global economy. \nRussia has proposed drafting a convention on \ninternational energy security that would cover all \naspects of global energy cooperation, taking into \naccount the balance of interests of all actors in the \ninternational market. We call for the start of the \npractical preparation of this document. \n As in economics, the logic of joint consolidated \nactions should prevail in matters of security and the \nelimination of surplus weapons worldwide. Russia and \nthe United States made another important step towards \nnuclear disarmament when they signed the Treaty on \nStrategic Offensive Arms and began its \nimplementation. Its practical realization will allow us \nto make sure that the Treaty is effective and viable and \n  \n \n11-51670 16 \n \nto see how its fundamental principles are implemented. \nWe call on all States with nuclear weapons capability \nto join the Russian-American efforts. We believe that \nfurther progress in nuclear arms reductions is possible \nonly on a multilateral basis. \n Moreover, progress in this area is inseparable \nfrom coordinated efforts to move forward on all \naspects of strengthening international security and \nstrategic stability. This includes development of \nuniversally acceptable approaches to missile defence \nissues, an accounting on the impact of strategic \nconventional arms, prevention of the weaponization of \nspace and elimination of qualitative and quantitative \nimbalances in conventional arms. \n The deployment of strategic missile defence \nelements in various parts of the world alters the overall \nconfiguration of international security. It is not enough \nto make statements that the increase in global missile \ndefence capabilities would not undermine the basics of \nstrategic stability. The issue is far too serious. We need \nsolid legal guarantees that missile defence potential \nwill actually be adequate to the declared objectives and \nwill not disrupt global and regional balances. This \nholds equally true for both Europe and the Asia-Pacific \nregion, where the missile defence factor is beginning to \naffect the strategic environment. \n It is of primary importance for us to prevent the \nundermining of the non-proliferation regime. We call \nfor universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons, strengthening of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and \nthe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty. Russia has been one of the main \ninitiators of the proposal to convene in 2012 a \nconference on establishing a zone free of weapons of \nmass destruction and their means of delivery in the \nMiddle East and is now working intensively, together \nwith its partners, on the preparations for this important \nforum. \n The early resolution of the nuclear problems of \nIran and the Korean Peninsula would contribute to the \nstrengthening of the non-proliferation regime. We see \nno alternative to their political and diplomatic \nsettlement and to taking concrete steps to create the \nconditions for the resumption of negotiations. We call \non all partners to address these tasks with utmost \nresponsibility. \n The situation around Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi-1 \nnuclear power plant has highlighted the need to \nimprove the international legal framework in order to \nensure the safety of nuclear power facilities. The \nRussian Federation has made proposals to enhance the \nmechanisms of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and \nthe Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear \nAccident and to strengthen the relevant IAEA norms. \nWe urge support for these initiatives. \n In the age of new telecommunications \ntechnologies, international information security has \nbecome a challenge that requires coordinated efforts by \nthe international community. Reliable protection of the \nfield of information from malicious and criminal \nattacks is the goal of the initiative that Russia and its \npartners are promoting at the United Nations. During \nthis session, we will put forward proposals on \ndeveloping specific rules of conduct in this area. \n In a polycentric world, an effective international \narchitecture can be created only if it rests on regional \nbuilding blocks. The enhancing of global governance at \nthe regional level and the increasing role of regional \norganizations are an integral part of modern \ninternational relations. Integration associations and \norganizations in the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates area contribute to these processes. The Eurasian \nEconomic Community, with its $10 billion anti-crisis \nfund, operates in the financial and economic sphere. A \ncustoms union between Russia, Kazakhstan and \nBelarus has been created, and single economic space is \ntaking shape with a view to establishing a Eurasian \nunion. \n The Collective Security Treaty Organization \n(CSTO) is a key tool for ensuring stability within the \narea of its responsibility. The signing of the joint \ndeclaration on cooperation between the United Nations \nSecretariat and the CSTO secretariat in March 2011 \nwas a major step in the collaboration between these \ntwo organizations, primarily in the field of \npeacekeeping. We are ready to start working on its \npractical modalities. Russia consistently calls for \ninteraction between regional organizations, under the \nauspices of the United Nations, to strengthen global \nstability on the basis of the solid legal framework of \nthe Charter. \n Priority should be given to equal and indivisible \nsecurity, predictability, transparency and mutual \nrespect, taking into account one other\u2019s interests. This \n \n \n17 11-51670 \n \nis exactly the aim of Russian President Medvedev\u2019s \ninitiative to sign a treaty on European security. Its \npractical implementation would allow us to finally put \na period to the post-cold war era, to establish a \nuniversal and clear framework for a reliable solution to \nsuch issues as missile defence and arms control, and to \ncreate a common space of security and development \nwithout dividing lines. \n Achieving equal and indivisible security is an \nurgent issue for the Asia-Pacific region, with the \nRussian Far East and Eastern Siberia as integral parts. \nThe joint initiative launched by the leaders of China \nand Russia in September 2010 is aimed at creating a \ncomprehensive architecture for security and \ncooperation in the Asia-Pacific region on a bloc-free \nlegal basis. We could move closer to this goal by \npromoting a network of multilateral diplomacy, an idea \nthat has been supported by the members of the \nShanghai Cooperation Organization. \n Progress in the settlement of regional conflicts \nwould contribute to a more stable international \nenvironment. Today, special attention is given to the \ndevelopments in the Arab world.  \n Russia condemns the use of violence against \ncivilians and supports the aspirations of Arab peoples \nfor the revival of their States and their democratic \ndevelopment and social and economic prosperity. At \nthe same time, actions by the outside forces must be \nbased on full respect for international law and be \ninstrumental to the search for a political settlement \nbetween the authorities and the opposition. The \nattempts to go beyond the Security Council mandate \nare unacceptable, since they undermine its authority \nand compound the suffering of innocent civilians. \n In this context, it seems quite pertinent that States \nand regional organizations commit themselves to \nstrictly complying with the existing norms of \ninternational law, including humanitarian law, in order \nto protect civilians during armed conflict. This step, \nwhich further enhances the existing legal basis of \ninternational relations, would contribute to the \nstrengthening of regional and global security in its \nmodern, multidimensional interpretation. \n The leading role in elaborating modalities for \npost-conflict resolution in Libya must be played by the \nUnited Nations and in particular the Security Council. \nThat is precisely the goal of Security Council \nresolution 2009 (2011) of 16 September 2011, which \nestablished the United Nations Support Mission in \nLibya. We believe that it is time to take additional \nsteps, including the lifting of the no-fly zone. \n As for Syria, it is inadmissible to boycott \nproposals for a national dialogue, stir up confrontation \nand provoke violence, while neglecting the reforms \u2014 \nlate in coming, but still achievable \u2014 proposed by \nPresident Al-Assad. It is important to encourage the \nauthorities and the opposition to start negotiations and \nagree on the future of their country. We hope that the \nLeague of Arab States will make the necessary efforts. \n The situation in the Middle East could be \nsignificantly improved by progress in the negotiation \nprocess, on the basis of the main parameters defined \nand recorded in Security Council resolutions, the \nMadrid terms of reference and the Arab Peace \nInitiative, and reiterated in the Quartet ministerial \nstatement of 23 September. The only viable basis for a \nsettlement is the coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli \nStates in peace and security. We support the \nPalestinians\u2019 application to the Security Council and \nwelcome the readiness reiterated by the President of \nthe Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Abbas, to hold \ntalks with Israel on the basis of the existing \ninternational legal framework. \n We encourage the Cypriot communities to \ncontinue negotiations under United Nations auspices to \nachieve a comprehensive, just and viable settlement on \nthe basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. \n We call upon all parties to the Nagorno-Karabakh \nsettlement process to take advantage of the additional \nopportunities arising from the efforts made in the \ncontext of Russia\u2019s mediation. We will promote \nconfidence-building and ceasefire enforcement \nmeasures within the framework of the Troika of the \nco-Chairs of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe Minsk Group, together with \nAmerican and French partners. \n We hope that the decision taken in Moscow on \n22 September on resuming official talks on a \nTransdniestrian settlement will encourage the parties to \nseek ways to arrive at mutually acceptable agreements. \n We are strongly committed to doing our utmost to \nprevent a repetition of a scenario involving the use of \nforce in the Caucasus, as happened in August 2008 as a \nresult of a reckless venture by the ruling regime in \nTbilisi. Russia is ready to act as a guarantor of \n  \n \n11-51670 18 \n \narrangements on the non-use of force between \nAbkhazia, Georgia, and South Ossetia, taking into \naccount the earlier relevant statements made by the \nleaders of these three parties. We would welcome it if \nthe United States and the European Union made similar \ncommitments. As guarantors, we would be ready to \ntake steps to prevent the resumption of violence in the \nregion and, in the case of the wrongful use of force by \neither side, to work towards an early resolution of the \nsituation on the basis of the existing norms of \ninternational law. \n Russia is providing significant support for the \nefforts to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan. At the \nsame time, we call on the International Security \nAssistance Force to more effectively fight the growing \nAfghan drug threat. Central Asia and Russia are \nalready facing a \u201cheroin aggression\u201d, while the profits \nfrom drug trafficking are being used as the main source \nof financing the clandestine extremist underground in \nthe region. The fight against this evil should be \nuncompromising, and it should target the entire drug \nbusiness chain. \n The problems on the African continent should be \na focus of continuous attention on the part of the \nUnited Nations. Such attention should include \ndevelopment assistance as well as efforts to overcome \nthe current humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa \nand resolve the numerous ongoing conflicts, while \nmaintaining the leading role of the African Union. \n The eradication of piracy remains a priority. It is \nnecessary to accelerate the establishment of an \ninternational anti-piracy court mechanism in the \nregion, in accordance with the Security Council \nresolution adopted on the initiative of Russia. \n Experience has shown that pressure and unilateral \nsanctions cannot be a cure-all in addressing various \nconflict situations; they only complicate efforts to \nresolve them. We urge that an end be put to any actions \nthat circumvent the Security Council. We also call for \nthe lifting of the blockade of Cuba. Cooperation rather \nthan isolation should be the method for settling \nconflicts in the twenty-first century. \n The ongoing transformation in contemporary \ninternational relations makes it a priority task on the \nglobal agenda to expand intercultural, interreligious \nand inter-civilization dialogue in order to devise \napproaches to the problems of the modern world that \nare based on shared values. The degradation of \nfundamental moral values leads to the degradation of \nsociety. The recent tragic events in Norway, riots in \nGreat Britain, protests by young people in other \ncountries, and calls to suppress Christian minorities in \nthe Middle East and North Africa \u2014 all of those events \nare the result of a deterioration in moral and ethical \nvalues. There can be no freedom without responsibility \nand no democracy without self-restraint. There is a \nclear and urgent need to counter the threats posed by \nnationalism, ethnic and religious intolerance. We \ntherefore reiterate the importance of the recent High-\nlevel Meeting of the General Assembly to \ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of \nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \nagainst racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \nrelated intolerance. \n Attempts to falsify or revise history are \ninadmissible, all the more so given that we are marking \nthe sixty-fifth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal \nverdict. Political correctness and talk of freedom of \nspeech cannot serve as a cover when, in certain \nEuropean countries, people who brought disgrace upon \nthemselves by cooperating with the Nazis are being \ntalked and written about in an increasingly elevated \ntone. Russia will never forget the countless military \ncrimes committed by Hitler and his associates in our \nland and throughout Europe during the years of the \nNazi aggression. \n The rapid changes taking place in the world make \nit imperative to strengthen the role of the United \nNations and to adapt it to contemporary realities while \npreserving \u2014 naturally \u2014 its inter-State character and \nthe immutability of its Charter principles. A \nfundamental element of the Organization\u2019s renewal is \nthe reform of the Security Council. We support a \nsolution that is based upon the broadest possible \nagreement. \n The world community faces many challenges, \nand the United Nations, as a major mechanism for \nglobal regulation, is today in demand as never before. \nTogether we will find practical ways to effectively \novercome the threats of the twenty-first century."

        "file_text": "The rapid changes in our \npolitical and economic environment show, once again, \nthe necessity of this annual gathering of the General \nAssembly of the United Nations. We have a difficult \ntask ahead of us. I wish the President of the General \nAssembly every success. He can rest assured that he \nhas our fullest support. I also wish to congratulate \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. \nHis steady hand has helped to steer the United Nations \nthrough challenging times. To him, too, we offer all our \nsupport. \n It has been a year of momentous change. An \neconomic crisis pervades most liberal economies. A \nwave of political change is sweeping through much of \nthe Middle East. Climatic turbulence leaves loss and \ntragedy in its wake. Famine stalks the Horn of Africa. \nNew choices confront political leaders. New priorities \nare presented to citizens. The worst that we could do \nnow is to allow fear and indecision to govern us. \n These are also times that call for a deep \ncommitment to international cooperation and \nmultilateralism. Every crisis that we address reaches \nbeyond our national frontiers. There is no way that we \ncan resolve such matters without the framework of the \ninternational laws and rules to which we are all bound. \n The financial crisis has had a profound and \nnegative effect on all our aspirations. While each \ncountry must adjust its expectations, we cannot allow \nourselves to be guided only by our national concerns. \nIn fact, they are best supported by greater commitment \nto a deeper solidarity among nations and far more \nintense cooperation. The great economic and political \nunions have achieved success by balancing sacrifice \nwith gain for all. The same challenge now confronts \nthe European Union (EU). \n In North Africa and the Middle East, we have \nseen a wave of protest that has convulsed the region. \nThe Republic of Serbia and the Serbian people have \nhad a long relationship with all the peoples of that \nregion. We stand by them. We know what is involved \nin such changes. \n In a time of such uncertainty, crises call for \nUnited Nations-sanctioned involvement to save lives \nand to keep the peace. There will be more such \nmissions. I am very pleased that the Republic of Serbia \nis now actively engaged in several such missions, and \nwe will continue our commitment. In that spirit, the \nRepublic of Serbia is a signatory to the evolving \nclimate change commitments and conventions. We also \nenthusiastically support the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. \n In times as complex as these, our objective must \nbe to manage real crises well and to avoid creating \nunnecessary ones. There are problems that can be \nresolved through patient discussion and the building of \ntrust. Unilateral action in such circumstances simply \ncreates crisis for no good reason. \n That is why, in our regional issues of South \nEastern Europe, we always promote the principles and \nthe presence of the United Nations. As a founding \nmember of the Non-Aligned Movement, we were able \nto celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its founding in \nBelgrade. Such networks create layers of \ncommunication and trust at a time of globalization. \n Our bid to join the European Union is the \nplatform on which we intend to build and contribute to \nour shared objectives. Regional cooperation is a \ncornerstone of our diplomacy, and we believe that it is \nonly to the benefit of the entire region. That is reflected \nin our chairmanships of the Central European Initiative \nand the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative. Most important, it is \nalso reflected in Serbia\u2019s chairmanship of the South-\nEast European Cooperation Process, our region\u2019s most \nimportant initiative. Next year, my country will follow \n \n \n7 11-51191 \n \nthat up by taking over responsibilities to lead the Black \nSea Economic Cooperation Organization. \n Serbia has established an entirely new level of \nconfidence in relations with Croatia. That has been of \nstrategic significance in securing stability in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina. We welcome Croatia\u2019s imminent \naccession to the European Union. \n All of that has set the stage for Serbia to actively \nconsider seeking the chairmanship-in-office of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE) for the year 2014 - the centenary of the start \nof the First World War. The unifying symbolism of \n2014 would not only help catalyse efforts to resolve the \nunfinished business on the old continent\u2019s shared \nagenda. It would also help to close the book on an era \nthat did not witness the enduring stability that the \nnations of the OSCE space deserve. \n We have devoted extraordinary levels of \nresources to capture war criminals. Finally, the \nRepublic of Serbia has completed its obligations to \nitself and to the international community. We believe \nthat, after the tragedies of the 1990s, that exercise is a \nvery necessary catharsis for our nation. That action was \nalso taken to demonstrate that Serbia wishes to move to \na climate of total reconciliation throughout the region. \nWe feel that we have done our part. \n Equally, we insist that everyone else does their \npart as well. As in all previous instances involving war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity in the Balkans, the \nSecurity Council has given a mandate to investigate. \nThat has greatly contributed to the process of regional \nreconciliation. This is the standard that must be applied \nin uncovering the full truth about allegations made in a \ndeeply disturbing report by the Council of Europe, \nentitled \u201cInhuman treatment of people and illicit \ntrafficking in human organs in Kosovo\u201d. Only the \nSecurity Council can make sure a comprehensive \ninvestigation takes place. Only it can give a universal \nmandate and jurisdiction to ensure that all perpetrators \nof war crimes in the Balkans are brought to justice, \nincluding those responsible for trafficking in human \norgans in Kosovo. I strongly believe that ending the \nculture of impunity in some parts of the Balkans is a \ncommon goal shared by every member of the \ninternational community. \n There is a certain irony to our proceedings today. \nThis year we have welcomed a new member to the \nUnited Nations family, the Republic of South Sudan. \nThe Republic of Serbia welcomes its membership in \nthe United Nations. We welcome them because they \nand the Republic of the Sudan, after many years of \nconflict, arrived at a settlement that was achieved as a \nresult of long, difficult negotiations between the two \nparties.  \n The fundamental principle that the best \nsettlements occur when two parties agree, each making \ncompromises, surely is universal. I subscribe \nenthusiastically to the comments by the President of \nthe United States, made from this rostrum, on that very \nsubject of negotiations. I agree that there is no shortcut \nto ending a conflict that has endured for a long time, \nand that peace depends on compromise among people, \nwho must live together long after our speeches are \nover. \n However, this rule is not being applied to Serbia \non the matter of its province of Kosovo and Metohija. \nOn 17 February 2008, Kosovo\u2019s ethnic Albanian \nauthorities attempted unilateral secession, a violation \nof the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, \nthe Helsinki Final Act and Security Council resolution \n1244 (1999). A majority of Member States have \nrefrained from recognizing Kosovo\u2019s unilateral \ndeclaration of independence. They have continued to \nabide by their United Nations Charter obligations to \nrespect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my \ncountry. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia, allow me \nto once again sincerely thank those countries for their \nsupport and solidarity.  \n Earlier this week, we heard from this rostrum a \ndangerous appeal for countries to recognize Kosovo. \nThat appeal does not contribute to regional stability. \nRather, it lessens our chances of finding a solution we \ncan all accept. The appeal we heard is not an appeal for \npeace but an appeal to endorse unilateralism and would \ncreate a deeply disturbing precedent, namely, \nencouragement for secessionists everywhere. \n In July, talks between Belgrade and Pristina, \nfacilitated by the European Union, were briefly \nsuspended by the facilitator. At that time, there was an \nattempt to impose customs officers on the \nadministrative boundary line between Serbia proper \nand North Kosovo. Violence erupted. My Government \ndid all it could to prevent violence from spreading, but \nwas this necessary? The effect was to remind Serbs that \nthey are negotiating with a gun to their heads and with \nthe constant threat of international isolation. It reminds \n  \n \n11-51191 8 \n \nSerbs that the excuse of violence by others is a tool \nused irresponsibly to threaten Serbs. It reminds Serbs \nof the anti-Serb pogroms in Kosovo in March of 2004. \nIt reminds Serbs of the failed negotiations and the \nimposition of a unilaterally declared independence. \n I want to remind the Assembly and all Members \nof the United Nations that on 5 October 2000 the \nRepublic of Serbia voluntarily and peacefully \noverthrew its past and entered a new phase in its \nhistory, in which it placed the fate of the Serbian nation \nunder the protection of democracy, civility, peace and \ndialogue. \n For this reason, we take grave offence at this \nclimate of threat emanating from countries that we \nwould otherwise consider our most natural partners. In \nthe case of Serbia, the dialogue between two parties \nwas initiated in March 2011, following a delay of \nseveral months to accommodate the electoral schedule \nin Pristina. \n We have made very significant progress during \nthose negotiations. The Republic of Serbia, I assure the \nAssembly, will remain a very active party to this \ndialogue. There are numerous issues that must be \naddressed in the months ahead. I appeal to all involved \nto remain engaged in this process in a constructive \nspirit. To that end, we expect the International Security \nForce in Kosovo and the European Union Rule of Law \nMission in Kosovo to fully observe the United Nations \ndoctrine of status neutrality, in accordance with their \nmandates under Security Council resolution 1244 \n(1999), the source of their universal legitimacy, both \non the ground and in the international arena. \n Progress needs trust. Negotiations and \nreconciliation are not achieved through concessions \nfrom one side only. Success does not occur when \nthreats of violence are issued and coercive action takes \nplace in the course of negotiations. Our response to this \nis to say that, just as we will never accept unilateral \naction, we will also not abandon the negotiation \nprocess. \n This is why we have stated that we cannot and \nwill not recognize the unilaterally declared \nindependence of Kosovo. It is also why we believe that \nwe must settle all other issues with Pristina, because \nour region needs to have a stable environment. \n The Republic of Serbia has always sought \ntangible assurances, bound by international agreement \nand guarantees, that Serbian communities inhabiting \nKosovo, Serbian interests and Serbia\u2019s cultural heritage \nwill be protected and allowed to flourish. \n Many of these issues have been discussed over \nthe past few years in different formats. Occasionally, \nthere have been agreements reached, but never \nimplemented. It is time that matters were clarified. Any \nform of understanding on the matter of Kosovo has as a \nconditio sine qua non the explicit negotiated and \nguaranteed agreement on the following matters \nessential to the protection of Serbs in Kosovo. \n The first concerns the status of the Serbian \npopulation in North Kosovo. All acknowledge that this \nis an issue that must be addressed on the basis of the \ncurrent realities. Attempts to change the current \nrealities would not be conducive to constructive \nsolutions. \n The second issue involves the proper \nimplementation of decentralization in Kosovo. All \nthose enclaves that are isolated from other Serbs must \nhave a political, judicial and economic life providing \nthe standards that allow them to prosper where they \nare. Serbia remains ready to continue to provide the \nnecessary support to these threatened populations. \n The third issue is that of the status of the Serbian \nOrthodox Church and of some of its key holy sites. The \nprotection of those sites and the special status that must \nbe given to them to preserve their unique identity and \ntheir livelihoods is a matter of fundamental concern. It \ncomes as a matter of surprise to me that an offer that \nwould be acceptable to the Republic of Serbia and the \nSerbian Orthodox Church has not been volunteered by \nthe other side. That issue is one of the most basic, and \nits denial should be considered a total embarrassment \nto the authorities in Pristina and the supervisory \ninstitutions and nations present in Kosovo. \n Finally, the question of property must be \nresolved. Thousands of private claims remain pending, \nmaking hostages of those internally displaced in 1999. \nCommercial property claims are unresolved, as well. \n The failure to advance with goodwill on the very \nissue that is at the core of our concerns \u2014 the rights of \nthe Serbian communities in Kosovo \u2014 is very \ndisturbing. For us, those four issues are the litmus test. \n There is so much to say about the progress in my \ncountry that is positive that it always saddens me that I \nmust repeat my concerns about the way in which the \n \n \n9 11-51191 \n \nissue of Kosovo is being handled. Let us all recall that \nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) placed \nKosovo under the interim administration of the United \nNations, pending a comprehensive settlement endorsed \nby the Security Council. There is a limit to what and \nfor how long Serbia must be held accountable for \ndevelopments where it is asked to assume responsibility, \nbut without the necessary authority.  \n I look forward to the day when I can stand at this \nrostrum and report that we have resolved that issue and \nthat we have found a mutually acceptable compromise, \nnot an imposed outcome where one side gets \neverything that it has ever wanted and the other side \ngets nothing. A maximalist zero-sum approach is a \nsolution with no future. We are ready. We are \ncommitted. It is for others to provide grounds for \noptimism. \n The Republic of Serbia has two immediate \nparallel objectives: to secure a mutually acceptable \narrangement in Kosovo that provides iron-clad \nguarantees for the Serbian communities and to \naccelerate our progress to membership of the European \nUnion. Both those objectives are achievable. It would \nbe foolish for anyone to think that one objective will be \nsacrificed on the altar of the other. It is for others to \ndecide whether they think that the achievement of \nthose two objectives is for the good of the region and \nfor stability. We are convinced that it is in everyone\u2019s \ninterest. \n I believe that Serbia has met the criteria to be \ninvited to be a candidate for membership of the \nEuropean Union. I also believe that my country is \nready to start accession negotiations. I believe that if \nthat were to occur, Serbia would, for the first time in \n20 years, begin to believe that the EU actually sees \nSerbia as an integral part of a complete European \nUnion. \n I fervently believe that my country has set an \nexample in the region in matters related to \nreconciliation, the establishment of the rule of law and \nthe fight against organized crime, as well as in building \nthe administrative capacity to handle European norms. \n Our battle against organized crime is a global \none. We know that international organized crime wants \nto use the region of South-East Europe as a base to \npenetrate the EU. The Republic of Serbia has decided \nthat it is a strategic priority and a national security \npriority that Serbia will help prevent that. Serbia is \ntherefore fighting a battle to protect citizens of the \nEuropean Union. It is actively engaged in a wider \nstrategy to destroy the links between organized crime \nand international terrorism. We cooperate with all \nnations that share those objectives. We appeal to the \nentire region to join us in that battle.  \n I am therefore convinced that the presence of \nSerbia as a candidate, actively negotiating its \naccession, is an important asset for the European \nUnion.  \n In that way, Serbia can continue to be an even \nmore effective member of the United Nations, \ncontributing fully and enthusiastically to the issues that \ntouch common humanity."

        "file_text": "I participate in this debate of the General \nAssembly in our dual position as President in Office of \nthe African Union and President of the Republic of \nEquatorial Guinea. I do so in the full conviction that \nthe passage of years and the experience accumulated in \nthe 66 years of the life of this world Organization will \ninspire the international community morally and united \nin social and political solidarity around universal \nnorms and principles in order to address any threat or \nsituation that may affect the planet. With this conviction in mind, I should like to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser, Permanent Representative of Qatar, on his \nrecent election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-sixth session. He represents an ancient culture \nthat has contributed much to the development of \nhumankind, and hails from a peaceful country that \ndemonstrates solidarity and contributes to the \nmaintenance of peace, stability and development in the \nworld. We are certain, that under his leadership, the \nUnited Nations will be able to solve the serious \nproblems affecting our countries. \n We would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his \nre-election to the helm of this world Organization, in \nrecognition of the work that he has done over the past \nfive years despite the various political, economic and \nsocial crises that our planet has faced and is continuing \nto face. \n On the basis of that conviction, the United \nNations, given the current trend whereby it is being \nconverted into a club for the powerful, must \nreconfigure itself so that it can resume its place as the \nmost representative and equitable organization in the \nworld \u2014 one in which those whose problems it is \nendeavouring to resolve can participate and have their \nvoices heard. That would ensure the democratization of \nall of the organs of this universal institution. \n With respect to peace and security, Africa, which \nis witnessing various fratricidal conflicts caused, in \nmost cases, by internal and external factors and by \nthird parties, has firmly stated that it is in favour of the \npeaceful resolution of conflicts, wherever they may be \ntaking place, through dialogue, mediation and \nnegotiation. \n Africa, a continent whose countries and peoples \nhave been exploited for centuries by foreign Powers, \ntoday is experiencing a new iteration of \nneocolonialism, involving the intervention of forces on \nthe basis of humanitarian principles and democratic \nfreedoms. In this connection, Africa must bring to the \nfore its international political personality so that the \nAfrican Union is respected, moving beyond internal \ndifferences caused by unspoken interests. \n Intervention by force, internal or external, has \nnever provided a lasting solution to conflicts since the \ncreation of the United Nations, as has been seen in the \nvarious conflicts that have taken place in the past \n50 years. Unfortunately, we can see that the United \nNations is being used dishonestly, under the pretext of \nhumanitarian interventions, when in fact those \ninterventions have served only to further violate the \nhuman rights of the peoples affected. The use of force \nin a conflict is not a unifying factor but rather one of \ndivision and destruction.  \n The African Union recognizes the victory of the \nNational Transitional Council of Libya in its fight \nagainst totalitarianism and recommends that its \nGovernment undertake a programme of transition \naimed at the holding of free and transparent elections, \nensuring their legitimacy through the participation of \nall of the groups that constitute the community of \nLibyan people. \n  \n \n11-50692 36 \n \n With regard to the situation in Tunisia and Egypt, \nwe also call on their Governments to adopt the legal \nand administrative structures necessary for democratic \nprocesses and State institutions.  \n I should like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the State of South Sudan on its accession \nto membership of the United Nations and to express \nour wish that the peoples of the Sudan and of South \nSudan will live in peace and harmony with all of their \nneighbours and with the international community. \n Today\u2019s world is suffering from an economic and \nfinancial crisis whose consequences are unpredictable. \nIt is the result of the irrationality of the current \npolitical, economic and social world order, which has \nmoved away from the social and humanitarian \nprinciples of equality, justice and fairness. \n In the political realm, we cannot transplant the \ncultural values of a country or a group of countries to \nothers simply because the world, and policies \nthemselves, are becoming increasingly globalized. \nRather, we must promote dialogue and coexistence \namong cultures and civilizations, because, if we do not \ndo so, the principle of the self-determination of peoples \nwill automatically disappear. \n It is true that democracy is a noble principle and \napplies to any cultural value that is practiced and \naccepted by peoples. To say otherwise would be to \nbetray the spirit of democracy that must develop in \nconsonance with the cultures of respective peoples. \n On the economic front, the social dimension of \npeoples must manifest in the form of productive \nactivities that benefit humankind. In that context, we \ncannot see any justification for the barriers, blockages \nand discrimination that we see in current economic, \nscientific and technical exchanges among nations, \nwhich only perpetuates the impoverishment of some \nand the ever-increasing enrichment of others. \n Indeed, the level of participation of the African \ncontinent in world markets is ridiculous, not even \ntopping 1 per cent despite its economic and human \npotential, which studies have described as representing \nthe future salvation of humankind. Africa calls on the \ndeveloped countries to show solidarity and help us to \ndevelop our economy so as to become an integral part \nof this planet.  \n Africa is not asking for a handout. Africa requires \na level of economic and technological support that \nwould enable it to process its vast resources, which, \nwhile contributing to accelerating its development, \nwould also have an effect on the economic stability of \nits partners. All of this requires profound changes in \nthe way in which we think about the current system \nand a readjustment of the methods and procedures used \nin international economic trade. \n The social order is determined by the political \nand economic order, but the political cannot develop \nproperly unless the economic does as well. In that \nrespect, Africa is making great efforts to develop its \nnational democracies, and many African States have \nadapted their political, legal and administrative \nstructures to the basic requirements of democracy. \n Nevertheless, in order to translate theory into \npractice, certain basic requirements must be met that \nmeet the material needs of humankind. Thus many \ncountries failed in this respect. Instead of their plans \ncoming to fruition, they became engulfed in fratricidal \nconflicts because they did not meet such basic needs.  \n Moreover, the African continent is facing, in \naddition to the economic crisis, the devastating effects \nof climate change, natural disasters, drought, famine \nand communicable diseases, which claim millions of \nvictims. In that respect, the African Union recently \norganized a donors conference to support victims in the \nHorn of Africa, with Somalia being one of the \ncountries most affected. The African Union has \nhonoured its commitment to tackle this emergency. \nHowever, the helping hand of the international \ncommunity is still needed. \n We believe that developed countries whose \nindustries are responsible for atmospheric warming \nshould meet their commitments under the Kyoto \nProtocol and compensate developing countries for the \ndamage and harm resulting from the effects of \natmospheric warming. \n The groups at greatest disadvantage in this crisis \nare women, children and young people. However, \nyoung people without physical, intellectual and moral \ndevelopment cannot take up the mantle from the \ncurrent generation to ensure the future of nations. \nHence there is a need to provide the necessary moral \nand material assistance to young people to ensure the \ndevelopment of the continent in the future. \n In that regard, the African Union Summit held in \nSipopo, Equatorial Guinea, adopted a programme for \n \n \n37 11-50692 \n \npromoting the employment of women and young \npeople and the fight against underemployment, as well \nas to provide professional and academic training. This \nprogramme needs the support of the international \ncommunity. \n In my own country, the Republic of Equatorial \nGuinea, we are committed to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals set for 2015. During the national \neconomic conference held in 2009 to plan for the \nrational use of our oil resources and others, the \nGovernment adopted a national economic development \nprogramme, with the aim of ensuring that Equatorial \nGuinea joins the ranks of emerging economies by \n2020. \n In parallel to this programme, the Government is \ncarrying out political, legal and administrative reforms \nin order to optimize the development of democracy and \nensure control, transparency, good economic and \npolitical management and guarantee maximum respect \nfor human rights. \n The political environment in my country is \noptimal for promoting peace, stability and \nreconciliation among all political forces, who work \ntogether in harmony with a unified set of consensual \npolitical criteria. \n Finally, Equatorial Guinea is participating in \nthese discussions with a good measure of optimism, \nbased on our belief that, contrary to the selfishness that \nprevents many States from joining their efforts to \ntackle the problems facing our world, what we are \nseeing every day is a growing awareness and \ninternational moral determination that the United \nNations should be a veritable centre for the unity and \ncohesion of the international community. \n Indeed, while Africa was isolated in the past, \ntoday the groups of countries who trust in Africa, its \nStates and the contribution they can make to the global \ndevelopment continue to grow. We wish the sixty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly every success."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at this session. I wish him \nevery success in his efforts to promote the interests of \nour international Organization. I also pay tribute to his \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, and express to him our \ngratitude and appreciation for his successful presidency \nof the Assembly last year. \n It is only natural that I should start by addressing \nthe current situation in Syria, our position in that \nregard and the circumstances and events unfolding \ninside and outside of our country. There is no doubt \nthat States\u2019 positions and circumstances are governed \nby their geopolitical realities, related problems and \ndemands stemming therefrom. At the same time, they \nare influenced by repercussions and the price they have \nto pay, whether high or low, resulting from positions \nthey take in response to those issues.  \n The Syrian Arab Republic is located at the heart \nof the Middle East region. Syria\u2019s location has \ndetermined its major role in the politics and balances \nof the Arab world and the region in general. For many \ndecades, Syria faced major challenges and difficulties \nwith a firm stance against attempts to limit its role and \ninfluence and divert it from the national course it had \ncharted. It is no secret that Syria has stood firm in \nsupport of national sovereignty and independence in its \nnational decisions \u2014 a position that has remained a \nprimary pillar of Syrian foreign policy. \n Syria has spared no effort in support of the \nlegitimate struggle of the Palestinian people and in \nchampioning resistance movements. Syria has upheld \nits inalienable right to liberate the entire occupied \nSyrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967. At the same \ntime, Syria has extended a hand of friendship to all \nStates and established its international relations based \non mutual respect and mutual interests. Through \nleverage, it has promoted the centrepiece of Syria\u2019s \nnational priorities and established policies, namely on \nthe Middle East question, in efforts to liberate the land \nand restore the rights of the people. \n Syria was dragged into another confrontation \nfollowing the occupation of Iraq. It had to choose \nbetween enduring political siege and isolation or \nsubmitting to demands. Again Syria summoned all of \nits might to overcome such a policy, despite the \nexorbitant price we had to pay at the expense of our \ndomestic priorities and interests. We emerged stronger \nfrom that battle, having preserved our independent \ndecisions and safeguarded our national priorities. \n There are two sides to the problem that Syria \nfaces today. On the one hand, the country needs \npeople-driven political, economic and social reform. \nPresident Bashar Al-Assad has already declared that \nthose reforms are needed and timely. He has expressed \na strong desire to accomplish them. But the force of the \npolitical circumstances to which I briefly alluded to \nearlier forced internal demands \u2014 important as they \nwere \u2014 to take a back seat to other priorities. Our \n \n \n53 11-51384 \n \noverriding priority was to address external pressures \nthat at times were tantamount to blatant conspiracy. \n On the other hand, popular demands and needs \nhave been manipulated to further objectives alien to the \ninterests and expressed desires of the Syrian people. \nThose demands have become stepping stones used by \narmed groups to sow discord and to sabotage our \nsecurity, eventually becoming a new pretext for foreign \nintervention.  \n Syria has assumed its responsibility to protect its \ncitizens through actions to guarantee safety and \nstability. It remains vigilant against the danger of \nforeign intervention, which takes on different forms \nwith each passing day. Challenging that does not \ndiminish our concern for popular demands that were \nalready accommodated prior to the recent events. In \nour view, the needed reforms are those that are now \ndue, many elements of which have been already met. \nThey are a work in progress that will continue through \nnational dialogue and in the context of national unity, \nsovereignty and independence. \n To shed more light on the situation, I would recall \nat this juncture the statement made by President \nAl-Assad on 20 June. In his statement, the President \nannounced many reform measures based on the \nfollowing new laws: the political parties act to \nguarantee political pluralism; the information act to lay \nthe ground for free and independent media; the \nparliamentary elections act and the local administration \nact. The proposed reform measures were to be finalized \nby a thorough examination and review of the Syrian \nConstitution. The review could eliminate certain \narticles to allow for political pluralism and democratic \npractices. It could even lead to the framing of a new \nConstitution that would guarantee all of these things.  \n The constitution is the backbone of the political, \neconomic and social life of all States. That reform \nmeasure will definitely respond to popular demands \nand needs. Furthermore, the President left the door \nopen to different views and proposals on the reform \neffort in general. In the televised interview that \nfollowed, the President announced that a timeline had \nbeen set to agree on and implement the proposed \nreforms in no more than six months. That is an \nextremely important position that requires a serious, in-\ndepth national dialogue in order to achieve the desired \nmechanisms and results.  \n A comprehensive dialogue started a few weeks \nago in various Syrian governorates. Representatives of \nvarious sectors of Syrian society, including opposition \nfigures, are participating in the process to examine the \ncomprehensive political, economic and social \ncomponents of the proposed reform package. \n We deeply regret the surge in foreign-inspired \nactivities of armed groups in Syria, which have not \nwaned and have instead continued to gain momentum. \nThat is the other side of the coin. We would have liked \nfor those countries that advocated the need for reform \nand change to have supported the official Syrian \nposition instead of having opted for incitement and \ndefiance. In fact, the more ground we have covered \ntowards stability and reform, the stronger the foreign \nincitement has become. Armed violence has surged in \ntandem with multiple economic sanctions. By targeting \nthe Syrian economy with sanctions, the United States \nand the European Union have jeopardized the interests \nand basic daily subsistence needs of the Syrian people.  \n This course of action cannot in any way be \nreconciled with pronouncements about concern for the \ninterests, security and rights of the Syrian people. \nFurthermore, it runs counter to the basic principles of \nhuman rights, in defence of which those States base \ntheir interference in our internal affairs. It must be \nrecalled that the Charter of our Organization states that \n\u201cNothing contained in the present Charter shall \nauthorize the United Nations to intervene in matters \nwhich are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction \nof any state\u201d.  \n Syria provided our region with a model of \npeaceful coexistence among the different segments of \nthe Syrian population, a model which deserves to be \nemulated. Syria opted for secularism to promote its \nnational unity in view of the religious and ethnic \ndiversity of the region to which it belongs, a region \nthat is the cradle of divine religions and the birthplace \nof human civilization. \n Any objective and realistic analysis of the events \nin and around Syria will demonstrate clearly that one \nof the purposes of the unjust anti-Syria campaign \ncurrently under way is to attack this model of \ncoexistence, which has been a source of pride to our \npeople. How can we otherwise explain media \nprovocations of financing and arming religious \nextremism? What purpose could that serve other than \ntotal chaos, which would dismember Syria \u2014 and \n  \n \n11-51384 54 \n \nconsequently adversely affect its neighbours? What \nelse could this course of action achieve other than to \nspread Western hegemony throughout the countries of \nthe Mediterranean and to serve Israel\u2019s expansionist \ninterests? \n I assure the Assembly that our people are \ndetermined to reject all forms of foreign intervention in \ntheir internal affairs. We shall continue to achieve \nsecurity and stability and to implement the \ncomprehensive programme of reform through national \ndialogue so that, within months, Syria will become a \nmodel of political pluralism and an oasis for peaceful \ncoexistence among the different segments of its \npopulation. \n From this rostrum, I call on the States that have \nparticipated in the unjust campaign against Syria to \nreconsider their positions. To them I say, \u201cOur people \nwill not let you implement your plans and will foil \nyour schemes\u201d. \n I also express our appreciation to the countries \nthat have stood by our people\u2019s side in this crisis, \npre-empting any harm that could have befallen their \ninterests and encouraging them to pursue their \naspirations. \n For many years, the international community has \nconsidered the two-State solution as the basis for \nestablishing peace between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians. The negotiations between the two sides \nthat have continued for years have failed to achieve \nany progress towards a solution owing to Israel\u2019s well-\nknown positions and measures. Therefore, the \ninternational community\u2019s pursuit of the recognition of  \n \na Palestinian State on the Palestinian territories \noccupied in 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, is \nlegitimate. It is a positive step towards restoring all \nPalestinian rights. Syria calls on the international \ncommunity to support that request. We also condemn \nthe Israeli blockade of Gaza and call on the \ninternational community to shoulder its responsibility \nand force Israel to lift the blockade.  \n Our position on declaring the Middle East a \nnuclear-weapon-free zone is well established and well \nknown. We continue to call for bringing pressure to \nbear on Israel to implement international resolutions \nthat have called on it to accede to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to \nsubmit its nuclear facilities to the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency\u2019s comprehensive safeguards regime. \nThis measure is of extreme importance to the security \nand stability of our region. At the same time, we stress \nthat all States have the right to acquire nuclear \ntechnologies for peaceful purposes. That right is \nguaranteed under the NPT. \n We strongly renew the call to lift the embargo \nthat has been enforced against Cuba for decades. \n We all aspire to a more just and secure world. \nThis international Organization has a major role to play \nin that regard. It can do so more competently if some \npowerful States gave up attempts to further their own \nagendas. Nevertheless, we still hope that the \ninternational community, through this Organization, \nwill be able to follow the right course so as to bring \nabout a better world, to which our peoples aspire."

        "file_text": "Being present at this forum is very important to express \nwhat we think, what we feel and what we work on, but \nit is also important to express major differences \nbetween Presidents and between Governments, our \ndifferences on policies, programmes, projects, \n \n \n11 11-50847 \n \nprinciples and values with some countries in this \nworld. \n This morning we heard the statements of some \nPresidents, and I realized that there are enormous \ndifferences between the so-called small countries, \ndeveloping countries, underdeveloped countries, \ncompared with some Powers. For example, in the \ndebate here at the United Nations there is a clear \ndifference between the culture of life and the culture of \ndeath, between truth and falsehood and between peace \nand war. \n Of course, we all have the right to have our \ndifferences. We have a right to deep differences about \nlife, but I believe that our Organization, the United \nNations, has a duty to make it possible to align the \nconstant work of Governments to guarantee peace and \nthe equality and dignity of all those living on plant \nEarth. \n When I say that there is a deep difference \nbetween the culture of life and the culture of death, I \nfeel that it will be difficult for us to come to an \nunderstanding with economic policies that concentrate \ncapital in the hands of a few. Data show that 1 per cent \nof the world\u2019s population holds 50 per cent of its \nwealth. If there are such deep differences, how can we \nresolve the problem of poverty? And if we cannot put \nan end to poverty how can we guarantee lasting peace? \n Furthermore, imperialism seeks to control the \nsources of energy throughout the world, and to that end \nit has instruments to impose, control and constantly \ninvade. And it is not just now; it has always been so. I \nremember when I was a child seeing rebellions of \npeoples against the capitalist system, against economic \nmodels that involved the permanent pillaging of our \nnatural resources. Left-leaning union leaders and \npolitical leaders were accused of being Communists in \norder to arrest them. There was military intervention \nagainst social forces. People were confined, exiled, \nkilled, persecuted and jailed, accused of being \nsocialists, Maoists, Leninists and Marxist-Leninists.  \n I feel that that has ended. We are no longer \naccused of being Marxists or Leninists, but now drug-\ntrafficking and terrorism are given as excuses. In \ncountries with many natural resources, particularly \nrelated to energy, we are threatened by foreign \nintervention, when Presidents, Governments and \npeoples are not pro-capitalist or pro-imperialist.  \n And then there is talk about a lasting peace. How \ncan there be a lasting peace where there are United \nStates military bases? How can there be lasting peace \nwhen there are military interventions? \n I believe that our United Nations is subordinate to \nthe Security Council. What is the use of the United \nNations if a group of countries decides on \ninterventions, on killings? It is a Security Council for \nwhom? It is a Security Council for Presidents, \nGovernments, peoples who are pro-imperialist or \npro-capitalist. But it is the Insecurity Council for \nPresidents, peoples or Governments who seek \nliberation \u2014 not only cultural liberation, but also \neconomic liberation: the recovery of their economic \nresources. Those are the deep divisions between the \nPresidents from the various continents who are taking \npart in our debates. \n If we want the Organization to have the authority \nto see that its resolutions are respected, we should \nthink of founding afresh the United Nations. We cannot \ncontinue on the current footing. \n Why do I say that? Every year at the United \nNations, almost 100 per cent of the Member States \u2014 \nthe United States and Israel being the exceptions \u2014 \ndecide that the economic blockade of Cuba should be \nended. Who ensures that that decision is respected? \nThe Security Council will never ensure that such \nUnited Nations resolutions are respected; the United \nNations cannot ensure respect for that decision of the \nwhole world to lift the blockade against Cuba.  \n I cannot understand how the resolutions of an \nOrganization of all the countries of the world are not \nrespected. What, then, is the United Nations? It is time \nfor an in-depth debate on founding afresh this great \nOrganization, the largest in the world. We should \ndebate its role so that the United Nations is recognized \nand respected by the peoples of the world. That can \nhappen only with the re-establishment of the United \nNations as a body which fights for the equality of all \nthe inhabitants of planet Earth, for the dignity of all \nthose whom we represent at the United Nations. \n I have heard a number of interventions about \nPalestine. Of course, Palestine has our full support. \nBolivia not only supports recognition of Palestine at \nthe United Nations, but also wishes to welcome \nPalestine to the United Nations. Here I have a profound \nobservation. When Israel bombs, attacks, kills and \ntakes Palestinian land, there is no Security Council for \n  \n \n11-50847 12 \n \nthat; there is no international organization that can stop \nthose bombings and killings, the genocide in Palestine. \n When there was a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Honduras, where \nwere the military bases to defend a President elected by \nthe Honduran people? Where was the Security Council \nor the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to \ndefend democracy in Honduras? \n It is time for us to think deeply about this. When \nthere are anti-imperialist Presidents with anti-capitalist \nGovernments, the empire tries to create internal \nconflicts with what appear to be major confrontations, \nmaking it appear in the media that a certain President \nshould fall, or it tries to divide a country to justify \nintervention. \n When there was a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Honduras and \nthere were killings in Palestine, where was NATO? \nWhere was the Security Council? They were nowhere \nto be found. \n For those and many other reasons, it is important \nto think again about re-establishing the United Nations. \n How can we Presidents and Governments face \nour responsibility of freeing our countries? Let me \nspeak of some important aspects of my experience as \nPresident. \n First, our natural resources can never be \nprivatized. They can never be handed over to \ntransnational companies, whether they be minerals, oil \nor other natural resources. Before I became President, \nhydrocarbons were in the hands of transnational \ncompanies. What did the contracts say? They declared \nthat the owner assumed the right of ownership at the \nmouth of the well. Governments told us that as long as \nthe resource \u2014 gas, oil \u2014 was underground it \nbelonged to all Bolivians, but the minute it came out of \nthe ground it belonged instead to the transnational \ncompanies. In the contracts they concocted the idea \nthat the contract holder acquired ownership at the \nmouth of the well; as soon as the oil and gas came out \nof the ground they no longer belonged to Bolivians. \nThat was a constant pillaging of our natural resources. \n On 1 May 2006, we nationalized and recovered \nour natural resources through a supreme decree. From \nthen on our national economy began to change. From \nthen on Bolivia stopped being a beggar State. Before \n2006 \u2014 I say this very sincerely \u2014 Bolivia was a \nsmall country sometimes considered an \nunderdeveloped or developing country; it does not \nmatter what term is used.  \n We have just 10 million inhabitants. Investment \nin Bolivia in 2005 was only $600 million, and more \nthan 50 per cent of it was credits or international \ncooperation. Less than 50 per cent consisted of our \nown resources. How much investment has there been \nthis year? The answer is $3.6 billion, with 20 per cent \nor 30 per cent of that being through international \ncooperation or credits, while almost 80 per cent is our \nown resources, thanks to our recovery of hydrocarbons, \ngas. How our economy has changed! \n From 1948 until 2005 Bolivia never had a fiscal \nsurplus; it was in deficit. In our first year in charge \u2014 \n2006 \u2014 we achieved a fiscal surplus. We also created \nbonds for children and the elderly. We started to \ndemocratize our economy, apart from increasing \ninvestment. For the 180 years after Bolivia was \nfounded in 1825, what international reserves did we \nhave until 2005? The answer is $1.7 billion. Over \n180 years, Governments of all kinds \u2014 liberal, military \ndictatorships, neo-liberal \u2014 were able to save for \nBolivia only $1.7 billion. In less than six years we have \nsaved over $10 billion; Bolivia now has $11.7 billion \nin international reserves. \n In 2005, we were the next to last country in terms \nof international reserves. Now we have improved, \nthanks to the recovery and nationalization of \nhydrocarbons. Recovering natural resources, having \nthem in the hands of the State, is very important for \nimproving the economy; we cannot privatize natural \nresources and hand them over to the transnationals.  \n We can have partners. That is fine. But \ncompanies cannot be the owners of our natural \nresources. The State, the people, must be the owner. I \nmention this experience because thanks to our \ndecision, responding to the call of the Bolivian people, \nwe started to change the national economy. \n I have a second point. Basic public services can \nnever be provided by private businesses. I am speaking \nof water, energy, electricity and the telephone service. \nThis morning, someone said that the prices of \nagricultural products are rising by 25 per cent or 30 per \ncent \u2014 even 50 per cent in some cases \u2014 and have \nbeen doing so for four or five years. Prices are going \nup because we do not yet control agricultural \nproduction. Since the State has controlled basic \nservices in Bolivia, electricity, telephone and drinking \n \n \n13 11-50847 \n \nwater tariffs have not risen, because they are basic. \nPublic utilities must be the responsibility of the State, \nand not of the private sector. \n How can we allow water, the stuff of life, to be in \nprivate hands? I welcome the support we have received \nfrom the General Assembly for water to be a human \nright and express thanks on behalf of the people and \nGovernment of Bolivia. It is our responsibility to \nimplement throughout the world the concept of water \nas a human right, thus supporting the least privileged \nwhen it comes to water. \n My third point concerns the constant struggle of \npeoples for dignity and sovereignty. In Bolivia I too \nhave to put up with a United States military base. And \nwhat do the uniformed United States outsiders do? \nThey command the national police and the armed \nforces, because of political decisions of former \nPresidents, those who preceded me in the Palacio \nQuemada, as it is known in some sectors of society. \nThe Chimore airport could not be used without the \npermission of the United States embassy. That woke us \nup to the importance of defending the dignity and \nsovereignty of our peoples.  \n What I have described gave rise to a great \nmovement, not only social and cultural, but also \nelectoral. It led to a political liberation movement, a \nmovement to return dignity to all Bolivians, and to my \nattaining the presidency. \n When I became President, I closed the military \nbase. How is it possible in this new millennium, in the \ntwenty-first century, for there still to be foreign \nmilitary bases all around the world? How is it possible \nfor there still to be interventions decided upon by the \nSecurity Council? That situation is a threat to \nhumanity, an attack on the dignity of all the countries \nof the world. That is why we must develop proposals \nfor the United Nations that will make it possible not \nonly to free all the people living on this planet, but to \nrestore dignity to them. \n My fourth point concerns international financial \ninstitutions. I remember that when I was a union leader \nGovernments could never obtain the resources for \ninvestment. We were told that Bolivia did not have the \ncapacity to borrow. Bolivia did not have easy access to \ninternational loans. But what did the International \nMonetary Fund do? It made loans conditional. It told \nGovernments that if they privatized refineries and \ntelecommunications they would give credits of \n$30 million to $40 million. \n A usurious bank, conditional credits and credits \nrequiring security are no solution. No credits were \ngiven to States, or to the productive sector. They were \nall for services and trade. Above all, they went to the \ntransnationals. \n When I became President, one of the \ntransnational oil companies told me that the \nGovernment would have to guarantee a credit of \n$100 million to build a pipeline. I wondered about the \npurpose. Finally, the oil company, Transredes, was \nconspiring politically, and we therefore decided to \nnationalize its properties \u2014 oil and gas pipelines. We \nexpelled it. Then we began to invest through the State \ncompany, Yacimientos, without borrowing a single \ndollar, and the Carrasco Cochabamba pipeline is now \nunder construction. But if the transnational had \ncontinued to be responsible, we would certainly have \nhad to guarantee a loan for it. \n As the Assembly is aware, I come from the \nindigenous peasant movement. When our families talk \nabout a company, they think of it as something that has \na lot of money and is made up of millionaires. So I \ncould not understand how a company could ask the \nGovernment to lend it money for an investment. \n The international financial institutions deal \nthrough companies, but who has to pay? It is the \npeoples, the States. So we must create other financial \ninstitutions. Fortunately, we are making good progress \nin South America. The Bank of the South will be \ncompletely different from the usurious banks that \nfeather their own nests and make money through \nspeculation. That must end. Regional integration will \nfree us from the domination of those banks. \n It is important for us to go further in that \nintegration. In Bolivia we have barriers to overcome, \nand other countries of the Union of South American \nNations (UNASUR) also have problems. For example, \nwe have a historic demand upon Chile for a sovereign \ncorridor to the Pacific. We decided to have recourse to \ninternational tribunals to ask for that access. \nResolution 37/10 of 15 November 1982 establishes in \nits annex, the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \nSettlement of International Disputes, that recourse to \nan international tribunal to settle disputes between \nStates should not be considered an unfriendly act. \n  \n \n11-50847 14 \n \n Bolivia has right and reason on its side in going \nto an international tribunal, because our landlocked \nstate results from an unjust war, an invasion. For \nBolivia, calling for a solution in the international \nsphere means for Bolivia redressing a historic injustice. \n Bolivia is a friendly, peaceful State which gives \npriority to dialogue with its neighbours. We therefore \nkeep open channels for bilateral negotiation with Chile, \nwithout, however, renouncing the right to go to an \ninternational court. There is regional involvement as \nwell, since this is not just a bilateral problem, but is a \nregional problem as well. \n Peoples are not responsible for the landlocked \nstate of Bolivia. Those responsible are, as always, the \noligarchies, the transnationals, which wish to protect \ntheir access to natural resources. The 1904 Treaty did \nnot lead to either peace or friendship, because for more \nthan a century Bolivia had no access to a sovereign \nport of its own. I take this opportunity to call on the \nUnited Nations, other international organizations and \nespecially the region to support us, so that we can \nreturn with sovereignty to the Pacific Ocean. \n In addition, there is another movement of \ncountries taking place, that of the countries of Latin \nAmerica with the Caribbean. I would say that it is a \nnew Organization of American States, without the \nUnited States, in order to free us of certain impositions, \nwith the benefit of our experience in UNASUR. I say \nthat because we no longer find ourselves obliged, when \nthere are conflicts between countries and within \ndemocracies, to have somebody coming from outside \nand above to re-establish order. Presidents and \nGovernments meet to resolve internal problems. This is \na great liberation for us. \n I also take this opportunity to touch on a central \ntopic: the fight against drug trafficking. United States \nimperialism is using the war on drugs for political \nends. The United States Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA) in Bolivia was not fighting drug \ntrafficking; it was controlling it for political purposes. \nThe DEA would implicate union leaders or anti-imperialist \npolitical leaders.  \n Many politicians have been saved from that dirty \nwork of the empire in attempting to implicate us in \ndrug trafficking, which still goes on. Last week some \nparts of the United States media said that my aircraft \nhad been detained in the United States with traces of \ncocaine. How false! They are trying to confuse the \npeople, trying to conduct a dirty campaign against my \nGovernment and against the State of Bolivia. \n What does the United States do? It decertifies \nBolivia and Venezuela. What moral authority does it \nhave to certify or decertify nations of Latin America, \nwhen the United States is the world\u2019s leading drug \nconsumer, when the United States is one of the world\u2019s \nproducers of marijuana \u2014 in some years the biggest? \nWhat authority does it have to certify or decertify any \ncountry? This is another way of trying to scare \ncountries or punish them. \n However, Bolivia, very responsibly, continues to \nfight drug trafficking. A report by the State Department \nrecognizes that there has been a net reduction in coca \ncultivation, with improved interdiction. Where is the \nmarket? The market is what drives drug trafficking, \nand the market is here. Who is decertifying the United \nStates because it has not cut down the market? This \nmorning President Calder\u00f3n of Mexico said that the \ndrug market continues to grow. Why is no \nresponsibility taken for eliminating the market? As \nlong as there is a market coca leaves and other \nproducts will be turned into drugs. \n A great responsibility must be borne. Here I make \nan appeal. Let us fight with shared responsibility. Why \ndo we not put an end to banking confidentiality? The \nbiggest drug traffickers put their millions of dollars not \nin briefcases or backpacks but in the banks. Why is \nthere fear of banking secrecy? In Bolivia we are not \nafraid. Banking confidentiality must be ended if we \nwant to fight drug trafficking head on. \n One of the crises on the margin of the crisis of \ncapitalism is the food crisis. New international \nfinancial structures give opportunities to people with \nlow incomes by providing microcredits to small \nproducers. We have some experience in Bolivia, where \ncredits at zero interest have been given to producers of \nrice, wheat, corn and soy at zero interest. Food \nproducers can even pay their debts with their products. \nSoft credits are given to encourage food production. \n Yet the international banks never take the small \nproducer into account; they never pay any heed to \ncooperatives, to associations, which can very well \ncontribute if given the chance. \n There are new ways to encourage production \nthrough fair trade. We have to put an end to the \nso-called competitive market. In a competition who \n \n \n15 11-50847 \n \nwins? It is the most powerful, those with the greatest \nadvantages. Transnational companies are always the \nwinners. The losers are the small producers, families \nwanting to rise through their own efforts. Therefore, \nwe are trying in the region to implement policies of \ncomplementarity and solidarity, and not of competition. \nWith naked competition we shall never be able to solve \nthe problem of poverty. \n Finally on this matter, the crisis of capitalism has \nno exit. When I was a young boy much mention was \nmade of the foreign debt of poor countries. It was said \nthat it could never be paid. Now the situation is quite \nthe opposite: the debts of the poor countries can easily \nbe settled, but the crisis of capitalism is a bottomless \nhole. The crisis of capitalism is not just because of \ncircumstances; it is structural. \n What do capitalist or imperialist countries do? \nThey seek any pretext to invade a country and make off \nwith its natural resources. This morning the President \nof the United States said that Iraq was already free and \nwould govern itself. The Iraqis will be able to govern \nthemselves, of course, but in whose hands is the oil \nnow?  \n The fall of autocracy in Libya was hailed, and \nnow there is democracy, but in whose hands is Libyan \noil? The world and the Libyans have come to realize \nthat reason for the invasion and the bombings was not \nto bring about the fall of Al-Qadhafi by rebels but a \ndesire for Libyan oil. Next year we can review the \nsituation and see which countries have their hands on \nLibyan oil.  \n There is a desire to overcome the crisis of \ncapitalism by making off with our oil, gas and other \nnatural resources. But we also have the great \nresponsibility of defending the rights of Mother Earth. \nI continue to be convinced that the best way to defend \nhuman rights is to defend the rights of Mother Earth. \n Here we have the great responsibility of looking \nafter the rights of Mother Earth. Only 60 years ago the \nAssembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights; it was only 60 years ago that the United \nNations realized that the human being also has rights. \nAfter political rights, economic rights, the rights of \nindigenous peoples, now we have the enormous \nresponsibility of defending the rights of Mother Earth. \n We are also convinced that infinite growth on a \nfinite planet is unsustainable and impossible. The limit \nto growth is the regenerative capacity of the planet\u2019s \necosystems. We therefore call for a new 10 commandments \nconcerning social demands, financial systems, natural \nresources, basic services, production, and dignity and \nsovereignty. On that basis we should begin to re-\nestablish the United Nations so that it can be the \nhighest instance to settle issues of peace, poverty, \ndignity and sovereignty. \n I hope that my experience as President of Bolivia \nwill be useful to all those present. At the same time, I \ncome to learn from many of them so that I may \ncontinue working for the equality and dignity of the \nBolivian people."

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser on his election to preside over the Assembly \nat the sixty-sixth session. Let me also commend his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his \nleadership in guiding us over the Assembly\u2019s sixth-fifth \nsession. May I take this opportunity to congratulate \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. \n Indonesia would also like to welcome South \nSudan as a Member of the United Nations.  \n Our world continues to be full of challenges, \npolitical and military tensions and conflicts, as well as \nthreats of nuclear weapons and of acts of piracy and \nterrorism. There is the financial and economic crisis. \nWorse and more fundamental still, in many corners of \nthe world there is abject poverty and hunger, \nenvironmental threats and natural disasters, energy and \nfood insecurity, intolerance and discrimination. There \nare authoritarian regimes bent on suppressing the \nclamour for democracy and respect for human rights. \n We believe that in convening in this historic Hall, \nas we do every year, we must seek more than simply to \nreview the past year, to lament opportunities lost and to \ncongratulate ourselves on the gains made. Rather, we \nmust ensure that, moving forward, as nations we stand \nunited \u2014 United Nations \u2014 in addressing and \nanticipating the challenges ahead.  \n In particular, we must stand united in \ntransforming challenges into opportunities for nations \nto forge mutually beneficial partnerships, anchored in \nthe principles of the United Nations Charter. We must \nchange challenges into opportunities to promote a new \nkind of international relations that accentuates \npartnership rather than confrontation, and that places \nprimacy on the building of bridges rather than the \ndeepening of fault lines and divisions, and on nations \naggressively waging peace and development. \n Waging peace and development in the Middle \nEast must, first and foremost, entail correcting the \nhistoric injustice to the Palestinian people that has been \nallowed for too long. Indonesia\u2019s support for the \nlegitimate aspirations and rights of the people of \nPalestine to live in freedom, peace, justice and dignity \nin their own homeland has been steadfast and will \ncontinue unabated. \n Indonesia therefore strongly supports Palestine\u2019s \npresent quest for full membership in the United \nNations. Such membership is consistent with the vision \nof the two-State solution and of a just and \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. Indeed, the \nrecent heightened worldwide focus on the issue of \nPalestine can, and must, be channelled in a \nconstructive way towards the promotion of an inclusive \npartnership among nations that leads to the fulfilment \nof the historic responsibilities shouldered by our \nUnited Nations. \n The continued denial of the most basic rights of \nthe Palestinian people becomes all the more glaring in \nthe face of the welcome democratic transformation that \nis under way in parts of North Africa and the Middle \nEast. Like many, Indonesia has been deeply concerned \nby the untold losses and casualties suffered by innocent \ncivilians. The bloodshed and use of force must be \nbrought to an immediate end, for, ultimately, political \nsolutions must be found. That means that conditions \nconducive for people to shape their own future must be \npromoted. Thus in Libya, for example, Indonesia \n  \n \n11-51390 28 \n \nsupports the National Transitional Council in its efforts \nto promote a peaceful and democratic transition. \n A decade or so ago now, Indonesia too went \nthrough a tumultuous process of democratic change. \nToday, as the third largest democracy, Indonesia is \nreaping the democratic dividends of such change. That \nis why we believe that political development and \ndemocratization should constitute a priority item on \nour agenda, to allow States to share lessons learned and \nexperiences in their unique paths towards \ndemocratization. That is why we took the initiative of \nlaunching the Bali Democracy Forum \u2014 the only \nintergovernmental forum for the sharing of experience \nand cooperation on political development in Asia. It is \na forum for partnership in the promotion of democracy. \n Global partnership is particularly key in \naddressing the challenges of development in order to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals and to \nprevent the recurrence of famine, which we are \ncurrently witnessing in the Horn of Africa. Thus we \nmust act in concert and in a focused and sustainable \nway to ensure food security for the most vulnerable. \nThat means increased investment in the agricultural \nresearch and development sector and increased \nproduction and productivity. \n I wish to highlight one particular driver of \neconomic growth and development. An enhanced role \nfor women in the economy is not only right, but also \nsmart, leading to both increased growth and more \nbalanced, sustainable and equitable growth. \n Achieving food security also requires that we \nconfront the reality of climate change. The \ninternational community must find the political \ncommitment to generate momentum for climate \nchange, towards a new climate regime after 2012. The \nforthcoming seventeenth Conference of the Parties to \nthe Climate Change Convention in Durban and the \nRio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development in \nBrazil next year must deliver. \n However, let us not wait. In Indonesia, we are \ncommitted to being proactive and to being part of the \nglobal solution to climate change. Through the REDD-\nplus programme \u2014 Reducing Emissions from \nDeforestation and Forest Degradation \u2014 we are using \nour natural rainforests as an important part of our \nmitigation efforts. \n Our commitment to work in partnership in \naddressing climate change must not founder before the \nlooming and renewed threat of the global financial and \neconomic crisis. In the face of that challenge, we must \ntake bold measures. The reform of international \nfinancial and economic governance must be expedited. \nEnhanced coordination of national economic policies is \nessential. We must learn to step out of our comfort \nzone and address those critical needs in concert. As \nemerging economies are now an important engine of \nglobal economic growth, they must have a greater \nopportunity to contribute to promoting solutions. \n The challenges confronting us are persistent and \nformidable, but we have the opportunity and the \ncapacity to address them and, most of all, to turn \nchallenges into opportunities. For a start, since those \nchallenges defy national solutions, they can at the same \ntime motivate countries to strike partnerships and build \ncooperation. In that regard, allow me to highlight two \nbasic points. \n First, we need to strengthen multilateralism in \norder to address global challenges. That means the \ncentral role of the United Nations. To be able to \naddress new and emerging challenges, and, not least, to \nidentify new opportunities, full support for and reform \nof the United Nations are key. That is the only way that \nthe United Nations can remain relevant and to ensure \nthat multilateralism flourishes. \n Through reform, we must ensure that the United \nNations and its decision-making processes are more \neffective, efficient, transparent and inclusive. We must \npersevere in strengthening the General Assembly, the \nEconomic and Social Council and their subsidiary \norgans, as well as the Human Rights Council. We must \nsupport the Peacebuilding Commission as it helps \ncountries emerging from conflict. \n The Security Council must better reflect the \ncurrent world situation. It should become more \nrepresentative, more transparent and, thus, more \neffective. All key issues of United Nations reform \nshould be addressed as integral parts of a \ncomprehensive package. \n Secondly, cooperation and partnership between \nthe United Nations and regional organizations are key \nto addressing today\u2019s global challenges. Thus, there \nshould be synergy between global and regional efforts. \nThat is particularly true in conflict prevention and \nresolution, linked to the theme of this year\u2019s General \n \n \n29 11-51390 \n \nAssembly session, \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means\u201d. \n In South-East Asia, as Chair of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia has \nworked ceaselessly to develop the region\u2019s capacity to \nprevent and to manage potential conflicts, and to \nresolve them. Our efforts have been focused not only \non the further development of ASEAN\u2019s conflict \nprevention and resolution mechanisms, but also on \ndeveloping and nurturing the necessary comfort level \namong ASEAN member States to resort to such \nmechanisms. \n As a result, we expect South-East Asia to remain \na net contributor to international peace and security, as \nwell as to economic development and prosperity. \nBeyond its own subregion, anchored in a strong \nASEAN Community, we are indeed set to attain those \nachievements by 2015. ASEAN continues to be the \ndriving force in promoting a regional architecture \nthroughout Asia-Pacific that is conducive to the \nmaintenance of regional peace and stability, which is \nprecisely the kind of conditions that have enabled \ncountries in the region to pursue a development path \nuninterrupted by wars and conflicts. \n In the current regional setting, in Indonesia we \ndescribe that as conditions that are marked by a \ndynamic equilibrium, where dominant power is absent \nowing to a lack of the promotion of block politics and \noften self-fulfilling geopolitical fault lines. Rather, \nthere exists a new kind of international relations, with \nits emphasis on common security, common prosperity \nand common stability. \n This November, a revamped East Asia Summit \nwill convene in Bali, Indonesia, with the participation \nof the Russian Federation and the United States for the \nfirst time. That will be part of an important regional \narchitecture. \n As ASEAN builds its Community and continues \nits central role in maintaining a stable and peaceful \nenvironment in the Asia-Pacific region, it sets a new \nchallenge and a new vision for itself, that is, to develop \ngreater cohesion and a common platform on global \nissues - an ASEAN that is a net contributor to the \nsolution of many of the world\u2019s ills and challenges. \nThat is in keeping with ASEAN\u2019s theme for 2011, \n\u201cASEAN Community in a Global Community of \nNations\u201d. \n To conclude, I wish to assure Members of the \nUnited Nations that Indonesia will be relentless and \nunceasing in promoting the ideals embodied in the \nCharter of the United Nations in promoting peace."

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to \nalign myself with the statement made by the President \nof the European Council, Mr. Herman van Rompuy, on \nbehalf of the European Union (see ). \nDenmark appreciates the adoption earlier this year of \n  \n \n11-51687 10 \n \nresolution 65/276, giving the European Union (EU) the \nopportunity to address the General Assembly at this \njuncture of its deliberations. The Lisbon Treaty marks a \nnew phase of European cooperation that will benefit \nthe United Nations as well. \n The past year has once again demonstrated how \nquickly events can unfold and how unexpected crises \ncan break out in different parts of the world. These \ninclude a violent conflict in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire before a \ndemocratically elected president could finally take his \nrightful place; devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in \nJapan, followed by nuclear contamination; the current \nand still more severe humanitarian crisis in the Horn of \nAfrica; and Pakistan being struck by overwhelming \nfloods. \n There have also been events of historic \nproportions that are still unfolding in North Africa and \nthe Middle East. From Tunisia to Egypt, from Libya to \nSyria, from Bahrain to Yemen and beyond, people are \ndemanding their rights and their freedom. They are \nstanding up for core human aspirations and values. \nThey want to shape their own lives, economically and \npolitically. Theirs is a call for political participation, \nfor freedom of speech and for the right of peaceful \nassembly; a call for dignity, for accountability, for \njustice and for jobs. It has sparked hope for a better life \nfor the people of the region. The international \ncommunity, with the United Nations in the lead, has a \nstrong responsibility to support these historic \naspirations. \n The winds of change currently sweeping across \nthe Middle East and North Africa have confirmed once \nagain that the desire for freedom, democratic reforms \nand respect for human rights is universal. A few days \nago, countries met under the auspices of the Secretary-\nGeneral to express their admiration for the courage of \nthe Libyan people in their struggle to take control of \ntheir own future. Denmark is proud to have supported \nthe legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people and to \nhave contributed to the protection of the lives of \nLibyan civilians.  \n A few days ago, the Assembly welcomed the \nNational Transitional Council (NTC) as the \nrepresentative of Libya. Being here today with the \nNTC in the seat of Libya is tangible evidence of the \nprogress achieved by the Libyan people in determining \ntheir own destiny. Along with the international \ncommunity, Denmark continues to support the \naspirations of the Libyan people. It is encouraging that \nthe Security Council has now authorized a new United \nNations Mission to support Libyan national efforts. \n Developments across the Middle East and North \nAfrica make it clear that in the twenty-first century, \nGovernments must be politically accountable, respect \npeople\u2019s rights and dignity, and deliver economic \nopportunities. The only credible response to those \nlegitimate popular demands is sustainable political and \neconomic reforms. \n Unfortunately, we sometimes witness countries \nfail to live up to their responsibility and obligations as \nmembers of the international community. As we speak, \nevents continue to unfold across the region, including \nin Syria. More than 2,600 people in Syria have died \nduring the popular uprising. We strongly condemn the \nviolence and the killings of peaceful demonstrators. It \nis high time to respect the right of peaceful protesters \nand their legitimate demands. To increase the pressure \non the Syrian regime, we have adopted sanctions and \nhope others will join us. \n Some of the prerequisites for a sustainable \ntransition to a flourishing democracy are free, fair and \ntransparent elections, free media, the protection of \nminorities, a functioning government and an \nindependent judiciary that upholds the rule of law. \nDemocratic change must come from within. It has to be \nhome-grown and based on local leadership, ownership \nand participation. Surely, this does not exclude \ninternational assistance, including from the United \nNations. \n Afghanistan has come a long way since the fall of \nthe Taliban regime. We hope that Afghanistan will take \nyet another step in its transition process at the \nupcoming Conference in Bonn in December. Moving \ntowards 2014, the United Nations system, in close \ncooperation with the Afghan authorities, will also have \nto undertake a thorough review of its activities in \nAfghanistan in order to continuously maximize its \ncontribution to good governance, anti-corruption and \nsustainable socio-economic development. \n What we see around the world is not only a call \nfor political reforms; it is also a call for inclusive \neconomic development, for jobs pure and simple, and \nfor improved standards of living. And not least, it is a \ncall from and about youth. Governments will need to \nstrengthen economic and social reforms, ensuring that \n \n \n11 11-51687 \n \nthey generate inclusive growth and shared prosperity \nfor all and not just for the few and already privileged.  \n The Millennium Development Goals have \nsucceeded in galvanizing action, not least in health and \neducation, and all countries have a joint obligation to \nensure that the goals we agreed in 2000 will actually be \nfulfilled by 2015. The development challenge is \npressing in sub-Saharan Africa, a region long marked \nby poverty and conflict, but in recent years also \ncharacterized in many countries by strong economic \ngrowth and optimism. \n National ownership and clear political \ncommitments remain the keys to success. But for many \nof the poorest countries, development cooperation \ncontinues to be an important tool and a catalyst in their \nefforts to ensure that the poorest people will also be \nable to enjoy the full potential of globalization. \nDenmark is doing its part to assist, based on a sound \ntrack record in international development cooperation. \nWe are one of only five countries which at present \nfulfil the internationally agreed development goal of \ndelivering at least 0.7 per cent of gross national \nproduct as development assistance. We would like to \nwelcome others to this \u201cpoint-seven\u201d club. \n We shall not succeed, however, without focusing \nin particular on countries affected by conflict or \nfragility. We especially look to the United Nations to \ncoordinate efforts in those countries. That is where the \nUnited Nations can make a real difference. \n The advancement of women\u2019s equality and the \nempowerment of women are important aspects of this \nprocess. We welcome the creation of UN-Women and \nlook forward to working closely with that new entity in \nthe area of gender mainstreaming. No less important is \nthe issue of sexual and reproductive health and the \nrights of women. \n The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20), to be held in Rio de Janeiro in \nJune 2012, presents a unique opportunity to revitalize \nthe discussion and understanding of sustainable \ndevelopment. Rio+20 will be an opportunity to put \nsustainable development at the top of the global \ndevelopment agenda. \n Denmark welcomes the focus on green economy \nand the institutional framework for sustainable \ndevelopment. Transitioning to a green economy is \nnecessary if the world is to cope with the multiple \nchallenges of resource scarcity, poverty eradication and \nclimate change. Economic growth will be crucial in the \ndecades ahead, but it will have to be green. Today, \n1.4 billion people are without access to modern sources \nof energy. Universal access to energy will contribute to \nlifting hundreds of millions out of poverty. \n Poland and Denmark, as part of the EU trio \npresidency for 2011 and 2012, are working jointly to \nstrengthen the green growth agenda and contribute to \nthe global objective of sustainable development, in \naccordance with the trio presidency programme. Next \nmonth, Denmark will host the first Global Green \nGrowth Forum in Copenhagen. The Forum will lend \nnew momentum to public-private cooperation on \nconcrete initiatives that will inspire regulatory \ninterventions, remove key barriers and identify \nopportunities and solutions for a renewed push to \nadvance green growth globally. \n Earlier this year, we witnessed the birth of a new \nState as we welcomed the 193rd Member of the United \nNations. The Republic of South Sudan is the fulfilment \nof the democratically expressed will to self-\ndetermination by the overwhelming majority of the \nSouth Sudanese people. We congratulate the people of \nSouth Sudan on their historic achievement. \n The Palestinian cause and quest for statehood are \nhigh on the agenda here in New York, and rightly so. \nThe present regional context reminds us all, including \nthe two parties, that direct political peace negotiations \nmust now be resumed. Within a specific time frame, \nthey must produce a lasting peace and an end to \nconflict based on the two-State solution, with both \nStates living side by side in peace and security. \n Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate \nthe Secretary-General on his appointment to a second \nfive-year term. We have all been inspired by his tireless \nefforts in the field of peace and security and human \nrights and by his strong leadership on climate change \nand sustainable development. At a time when the \nUnited Nations is ever more relevant, Denmark lends \nits full support to the Secretary-General and to his \nstewardship of the Organization. The challenges we \nface call for international resolve and for joint action. \nIn the Secretary-General\u2019s own words, \u201cWe need \nresults that people can see and touch, results that \nchange lives and make a difference\u201d (A/65/PV.101, \np. 9). That is why we turn to the United Nations. \n  \n \n11-51687 12 \n \n That is the end of my prepared statement, but I \nam aware that I am the last speaker in the general \ndebate of the sixty-sixth session of the General \nAssembly. Let me therefore also take this opportunity \non my own behalf \u2014 and I am sure also on behalf of \nspeakers before me \u2014 to thank the conference service \nstaff and the interpreters for their tireless efforts and \nlong working days, which have facilitated this unique \ninternational debate. \n The exchange of views that we have during the \ngeneral debate allows each and every one of us a \nprivileged glimpse into the positions, the values and \nthe political priorities of all 193 Member States. The \ndebate provides a strong and clear indication of what \nissues really engage Governments. It demonstrates \nwhat parts of the very broad United Nations agenda \neach and every Government is most preoccupied with, \nwhat their concerns are and which outcomes and \nsolutions they seek. From this debate, we get a unique \nand straight look into the soul of global politics. It \nhelps us understand each other, including when we \ndisagree, and it informs our work together in the \nAssembly in the months to come. \n So we may congratulate each other on a job well \ndone, now at the end of the debate, but it is only the \nbeginning. The true value of this debate will be seen \nonly later, and it will depend on all of us coming \ntogether to find common ground and workable \nsolutions."

I assure him of my delegation\u2019s \nfull support and cooperation. I also extend gratitude to \nhis predecessor for his stewardship of the Assembly \nduring its sixty-fifth session, and I would also like to \nextend congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \nre-election as Secretary-General. \n I also take this opportunity to congratulate and \nwelcome the Republic of South Sudan as the \n193rd State Member of the United Nations and to \nconvey the best wishes of my Government and people \nfor its peace and prosperity. \n On behalf of the Government and the people of \nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas, I wish to express \nregret at the loss of life and the tremendous and wide-\nranging destruction caused by hurricanes and tropical \nstorms during the summer season. The Bahamas, as \nwell as a number of Caribbean islands and, indeed, the \nEast Coast of the United States, were particularly hard-\nhit by Hurricane Irene. The devastation caused by each \nof those storms reinforces the need for global attention \nto the adverse impacts of climate change and natural \ndisasters. The storms\u2019 trail of destruction, which took \nlives, flattened homes and businesses, toppled trees and \nspread debris across roadways and bridges, and which, \nin some cases, caused almost certain irreversible \ndamage to coastal areas and ecosystems, compels, we \nbelieve, the international community to take immediate \nmeasures to address climatic phenomena which cause \nsuch huge losses and which threaten so many \ncountries. \n For us, the increased frequency and intensity of \nnatural disasters, including hurricanes, some due to the \neffects of climate change, are among the major \nchallenges faced at the national level. Other \nenvironmental challenges, including waste and water-\nresource management issues, together with economic \nand social challenges, all constitute serious constraints \nfor the Bahamas. \n We are committed to mainstreaming sustainable \ndevelopment principles into our national development \nstrategies. Progress is being made in the key areas of \nprotecting our biodiversity and supporting the \ndevelopment of policies promoting renewable energy. \nWe look forward to continuing to collaborate with \ninternational partners so as to achieve even greater \nsuccess in the years ahead. In this vein, the Bahamas \nlooks forward to next year\u2019s United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development. We fully \nexpect that the Conference will take into account \nunmet needs in connection with each of the three \npillars of sustainable development, that is, economic, \nsocial and environmental. \n We face an increasingly complex set of global \nchallenges, which has given rise to an equally complex \nnetwork of formal and informal global institutions and \nmechanisms designed to enhance collective action to \naddress these challenges. Consequently, the question of \ninternational governance as it relates to the global \nagenda has become a pressing issue in recent years. \n The global economic crisis of the past three years \nhas underscored the need for more effective global \ngovernance, as has the long and sometimes \ncontroversial debate on reform of the Security Council. \nArguably, at the heart of all of these issues, particularly \nfor some small developing States such as the Bahamas, \nis the need to ensure that our global systems are able to \neffectively respond to evolving global challenges in an \ninclusive, participatory and transparent manner. \n  \n \n11-51384 34 \n \n With respect to international economic \ngovernance, the Bahamas is acutely aware of the \ngrowing role of the Group of 20 (G-20) and the need to \naddress how the Group would be better able to engage \nand consult a wider range of countries, as well as the \nUnited Nations as a whole, with a view to helping to \ntranslate G-20 deliberations into effective actions on a \nglobal scale. Fortunately, the work of the Global \nGovernance Group has been largely successful in this \nregard. Indeed, the Bahamas joined the Group with the \nunderstanding that the United Nations has a central \nrole in global economic governance and that serious \nengagement with the G-20 would allow for a clearer \nunderstanding of their respective strengths and \ncomparative advantages. \n Reform of the Security Council is no more a \nreality today than it was a year ago, or even 10 years \nago. This remains, however, an important goal, as it \nstands as a harbinger of success for other equally \npressing global governance activities that will \ninevitably affect each and every country regardless of \nits size, economic or political power. The aspirations of \nthe marginalized for greater democratization, \ninclusiveness, representativeness, transparency and \naccountability are no less legitimate at the international \nlevel than they are at the national or local levels. If the \nCouncil is to fully fulfil its responsibility for \ninternational peace and security, it must reflect the \ngeopolitical realities of our world in its composition as \nwell as in its modus operandi. The Bahamas therefore \ncontinues to support Security Council expansion in \nboth categories and the reform of its working methods. \n The Bahamas believes that the main strength of \nthe United Nations is its inclusiveness, as it is perhaps \nthe only global body with unquestionable legitimacy. \nHence, we envision a greater role for the United \nNations in a number of areas, not in order to duplicate \nwork done elsewhere, but to help in other areas of \ncritical importance to small developing countries, \nincluding international cooperation in tax matters. \n The Bahamas, along with many Caribbean \nCommunity (CARICOM) countries, continues to seek \nthe conversion of the Committee of Experts on \nInternational Cooperation on Tax Matters into an \nintergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economic \nand Social Council, the central goal being to give small \ndeveloping countries an effective voice when issues of \ncooperation on tax matters are being decided by the \ninternational community. Likewise, we recommend a \ngreater role for the United Nations in the areas of \ninternational financial regulation and credit-rating \nsystems. \n As regards the global economic and financial \ncrisis, it is important to note that many small middle-\nincome and ostensibly high-income developing States \nsuch as the Bahamas continue to grapple with lingering \neffects, including serious credit and employment \nchallenges \u2014 challenges that persist owing mainly to \nindebtedness; non-concessionary status with respect to \naccess to resources of the international financial \ninstitutions; and an increasing rate of erosion of \npreferential access to the markets of major \ndevelopment partners. \n The Bahamas continues to develop national \ninitiatives to address these and other related matters. \nWe have seen some success in maintaining a \nsustainable of Government debt to gross domestic \nproduct ratio; implementing measures to provide relief \nand assistance to Bahamians; and efforts to modernize \nand expand our public infrastructure as well as increase \ninvestment in our least developed islands. \n These national efforts must be met with \nappropriate and urgent actions at the international level \nin order to effectively respond to these challenges, as \nwell as to help sustain progress in achieving the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. Such actions at \nthe international level must include the provision of \nnew and additional resources to assist developing \ncountries, in particular the most vulnerable among us, \nas well as the development of the necessary \nimplementation mechanisms. \n In that connection, the Bahamas wishes to \nunderline the importance of implementing the \nMonterrey Consensus of the International Conference \non Financing for Development. The Bahamas also \nwishes to highlight in this regard the critical role that a \nuniversal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and \nequitable multilateral trading system can play in \nstimulating economic growth and development in \ndeveloping countries. \n Migration can be, and has been, a positive force \nfor development internationally. Indeed, immigrants \nhave contributed to the development of the Bahamas in \nmany respects, largely through contributions to \neducation, health care and to the development of our \ntourism and financial services. Uncontrolled migration, \n \n \n35 11-51384 \n \nhowever, has also proved, and continues to be, a \nserious challenge to sustainable development. In this \ncontext, the Bahamas welcomes increased dialogue on \nimproving international cooperation with respect to \ninternational migration and development. We believe \nthat proper cooperation can help to ensure that \nmigration occurs through safe and regulated channels, \nto the benefit of both migrant and receiving States, like \nthe Bahamas. The Bahamas will continue to participate \nconstructively in the process leading to the second \nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \nDevelopment, to be held by the General Assembly in \n2013, with a view to addressing these and other related \nissues. \n The Bahamas congratulates the people of Haiti on \nthe election and installation of a democratically elected \nPresident and Government. We are heartened by the \npeaceful and successful manner in which the second \nround of elections was concluded in Haiti. Political \nstability is fundamental to Haiti\u2019s economic and social \ndevelopment. We hope that the issue of the \nappointment of a new Prime Minister will be resolved \nin the shortest possible time so that the Haitian people \ncan continue to recover from last year\u2019s devastating \nearthquake and reconstruct their country with a view to \nits sustained and sustainable development. \n My delegation continues to commend the work of \nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \n(MINUSTAH). Over the years, MINUSTAH has played \na key role in helping to lay the foundation for long-\nterm recovery and stability in Haiti, with its support \nactivities for State institutions and the rehabilitation \nand training of the Haitian National Police. \nMINUSTAH\u2019s role and functions should reflect the \ncountry\u2019s development needs, as articulated by the \nGovernment. The support and engagement of the \ninternational community in Haiti is as pressing and \nurgent as ever, and MINUSTAH must continue to be an \nimportant factor in this regard. \n The issue of international peace and security \nremains a critical concern for the Organization, as it \ndoes for the entire global community. The Bahamas \nunequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations and reiterates its commitment to the \nfight against it. The terror attacks of 11 September, the \nheinous attacks in Mumbai and Norway and at the \nUnited Nations headquarters in Nigeria demonstrate \nthat our efforts thus far have proved insufficient; hence \nthe urgency of our task. \n In an archipelago spread over some 100,000 \nsquare miles, the porous borders of the Bahamas have, \nfor many years, posed a challenge to national security \nas well as the rule of law. We are currently confronted \nby high levels of crime, too many of which involve the \nuse of small arms and light weapons. We are keenly \naware of the global threats posed by the illicit trade in \nsmall arms and light weapons, which is linked to other \naspects of transnational organized crime, including the \nillicit drug trade. \n The Bahamas, both nationally and internationally, \nis acting to reduce the threats that these criminal \nelements pose to our society. Nationally, we are \ncontinuing a programme of reform of our criminal \nlaws, modernizing and expanding our court system and \nstrengthening targeted programmes designed to address \nsocial ills. Regionally, we are working with other \nCARICOM nations to undertake a number of measures \nto combat these challenges. Internationally, the \nBahamas is committed to the implementation of the \nUnited Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, \nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms \nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. \n Regulation of the import, export and transfer of \nconventional arms is critical if we are to achieve some \nmeasure of peace and stability and reduce conflicts. \nThe Bahamas supports a strong, effective and \nnon-discriminatory arms trade treaty and welcomes the \ninclusion of the category of small arms and light \nweapons and ammunition within the scope of a future \ntreaty. What is clearly evident is the need for an \nintegrated global response to supplement actions at the \nnational, regional and subregional levels if we are to \neffectively prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit \ntrade in small arms and light weapons, and thus reduce \nthe escalating violence and crime in our societies. \n The Government of the Bahamas continues to be \ncommitted to the 2001 and 2006 Declarations on \nHIV/AIDS (resolutions S-26/2 and 60/262). Our \nprogramme, now in its twenty-fifth year, has been very \nsuccessful. We would like to take this opportunity to \nthank our regional, hemispheric and international \npartners for their support. \n My Government is also dealing with the \nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \n(NCDs), which pose an increasing threat to countries \nlike the Bahamas and others of the CARICOM \nsubregion. As our Prime Minister said in his national \n  \n \n11-51384 36 \n \naddress here last week (see A/66/PV.3), the health and \nsocio-economic costs required for Governments to treat \nNCDs are indeed enormous. The Bahamas and its \nfellow CARICOM countries welcome last week\u2019s \nHigh-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of \nNon-communicable Diseases, and applaud the \ninternational community\u2019s attention to NCDs. We trust \nthat the adoption of the Political Declaration \n(resolution 66/2, annex), while it is not as action-\noriented as we envisaged when we undertook the \nmandate from our heads of Government four years ago, \nwill produce results. We would have preferred the text \nto have reflected stronger commitments and specific, \ntime-bound targets for addressing non-communicable \ndiseases and their risk factors. We look forward, \nhowever, to a comprehensive review of this issue in \n2014. \n With the world community witnessing an \nunprecedented wave in the call for social change and \ndemocracy across countries in the Arab world and in \nNorth Africa, we must ensure, in our desire to promote \ngood and effective governance, that respect for human \nrights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the \npromotion of civil and political rights and the right to \ndevelopment, forms the basis of any long-term \nsolution. My Government\u2019s commitment to the \npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms \nis unwavering. \n This year we celebrate some significant \nachievements on the international human rights \nagenda: the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of \nthe Declaration on the Right to Development \n(resolution 41/128) and, more recently, the tenth \nanniversary, this week, of the adoption of the Durban \nDeclaration and Programme of Action. This year, we \nare also observing the International Year for People of \nAfrican Descent. \n In spite of the objectives of these laudable \ninitiatives for the advancement of the international \nhuman rights agenda and recent undertakings such as \nthe reform of the Human Rights Council, we are still \nconfronted with persistent poverty and stark \ninequalities, both within and across countries \u2014 \nracism, racial discrimination and related intolerance, \nsome 63 years after the landmark adoption of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (resolution \n217 (III)). These challenges serve as a constant \nreminder that we have much more to do to improve the \nlives of millions of disadvantaged and marginalized \npopulations throughout the world. While it is \nadvantageous to adopt declarations and renew \ncommitments, it is more important to ensure their \neffective implementation at the national, regional and \ninternational levels. The United Nations must therefore \ncontinue to reflect the ideals of its founding principles \nand unite us through a common vision of peace, mutual \nrespect and human rights for all. "

        "file_text": "It is a great \nhonour for me to address the General Assembly as the \nfirst democratically elected President in the history of \nmy country since its independence, following a free, \ntransparent and credible election whose result was \naccepted by all. My country paid a high price for the \ndawn of democracy, to which I have devoted almost \n50 years of my life.  \n Today, Guinea has turned an important page in its \nhistory. I would like to take this opportunity to express \nthe people of Guinea\u2019s gratitude to the international \n  \n \n11-51191 10 \n \ncommunity, in particular the International Contact \nGroup on Guinea, for their untiring efforts in the \ncontext of my country\u2019s return to constitutional \nnormality. To those thanks, I add my brother and friend \nPresident Blaise Compaor\u00e9, President of Burkina Faso, \nwho, as mediator in the Guinean crisis, spared no effort \nto restore constitutional order in Guinea. \n My presence in this Hall, which says much about \nthe history of peoples and nations, represents Guinea\u2019s \nreturn to the international stage. This is the place for \nme to assure the international community of my \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to respect and promote \nhuman rights, strengthen unity and national harmony, \nbuild a democratic society and ensure the progress and \nprosperity of the Guinean people. \n The challenges to be addressed are many and \ncomplex. The socio-economic situation that we \ninherited was hardly bright: an utterly failed economy \nwith the resulting inflation, corruption and a \ncompletely dysfunctional State. \n The outcome of the presidential election in \nNovember 2010 therefore expressed the legitimate \naspiration of the people of Guinea to profound change \nthat would foster the economic and social development \nof the country. That thirst for change is also justified \nby the considerable backwardness evident in our \ncountry despite its considerable human and natural \nresources. That is why, the day after the presidential \nelection, we committed without delay to a series of \nremedial measures in order to provide the way for \nbetter governance in the country. \n Strategies and dynamic policies were drawn up \nand implemented to improve people\u2019s living \nconditions. Among the reforms pledged, the \nGovernment grants agriculture priority in order to \nachieve food self-sufficiency. Likewise, the mining \nsector is being reorganized through the adoption of a \nnew more attractive policy that takes into account the \ninterests of Guinea and its partners. \n As part of that momentum for change, actions \ncontinue for the modernization and restructuring of the \njudicial system in order to ensure the promotion and \nprotection of citizens\u2019 rights and freedoms and to \nestablish an attractive investment climate. \n On the financial level, reform will make it \npossible to control inflation, prevent the \nmisappropriation of public funds and avoid having to \nprint money, as well as allow us to combat poor \ngovernance, impunity and corruption. Strict \nmanagement measures, such as the State one-stop shop, \nstrengthening economic oversight and the overhaul of \nthe administration, as well as undertaking audits, will \nstop financial losses and correct malfunctions. \n Apart from the steps to improve macroeconomic \nmanagement and the structural reforms that I have just \ndescribed, the Government has drawn up poverty \nreduction strategies to meet the population\u2019s basic \nneeds for income and access to basic social services, in \nparticular drinking water and power supplies. \nSustainable development being a major goal of the \nGovernment, it is clear that the health-care, education \nand environment sectors are among our Government\u2019s \npriorities. \n However, that ambitious programme to combat \nunderdevelopment and poverty cannot be fully \naccomplished without the ongoing and effective \nsupport of the international community. Moreover, \nnegotiations are under way with the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions on the signing of an agreement, which is \nalmost complete, on the Heavily Indebted Poor \nCountries Initiative to considerably reduce the Guinean \ndebt. That will enable us to free up considerable \nfinancial resources and devote them to the sustainable \ndevelopment of our country. \n I wish to acknowledge our deep appreciation for, \nand to renew our faith in, the World Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the African \nDevelopment Bank for the efforts already agreed on \nimplementing our development strategy. I would also \nlike to take this opportunity to express the Guinean \npeople\u2019s gratitude to all bilateral, regional and \nmultilateral development partners for their valuable \ncontribution to the national development effort. \n National reconciliation remains the cornerstone \nof our action. My approach in that process is to directly \ninvolve the population at the grassroots. In that \ncontext, I set up a provisional commission of \nreflection, co-chaired by the Grand Imam and the \nArchbishop of Conakry. That commission will work \nwith the wise men of the regions and prefectures on the \nways and means to bolster national unity for a genuine \nreconciliation. \n As a component of the nation, the army is among \nour priorities. The reforms seek to make it a truly \n \n \n11 11-51191 \n \nrepublican institution \u2014 guardian of peace, security \nand development.  \n Women and young people are key stakeholders in \nour socio-economic development. Those sectors of \nsociety receive my Government\u2019s constant attention. In \nthat regard, the empowerment of young people and \nwomen is another important factor. \n Following the presidential election, the people of \nGuinea are now working to prepare legislative \nelections, which will enshrine the return to \nconstitutional order. In that context, we decided to \nestablish a secure computerized electoral roll that will \nmake it possible to correct the anomalies noted during \nthe presidential election and to ensure the participation \nof all Guineans of voting age in the election. \n The Millennium Summit, held in New York in \n2000, committed itself in an ambitious declaration to \nreduce extreme poverty by 2015 (see resolution 55/2). \nDespite several meetings, strategies drawn up at the \nState level and the participation of the international \ncommunity, in particular through the Monterrey \nConsensus, the Rome summit on food security, the \nJohannesburg summit on sustainable development and \nthe Beijing summit on social development, many \nchallenges are still to be addressed.  \n We therefore need to periodically assess the \ndirection of the supporting measures to ensure that the \nlofty goals that have been set are met. That approach is \nshared by external partners, political parties, civil \nsociety, unions and other actors.  \n Despite the international community\u2019s repeated \ncalls for peace, areas of conflict and tension continue \nin several regions of the world, in particular in Africa, \nthe Middle East and Asia. The occupation of \nPalestinian land by the State of Israel is an ongoing \nconcern. The Palestinian people must exercise their \nlegitimate and inalienable rights, including the right of \nreturn to their lands and the right to establish an \nindependent State, within the borders established \nbefore June 1967, in peace and security alongside the \nState of Israel. That principled path alone could lead to \na comprehensive and lasting peace, which is a \nguarantee for all countries in the region, including \nIsrael. \n The advent of a stable climate in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a \nbrother country and neighbour, is reassuring after years \nof fratricidal clashes.  \n My delegation welcomes the entry of the \nRepublic of South Sudan into the body of free nations. \n The tragic humanitarian situation prevailing in \nthe Horn of Africa is a source of serious concern. The \nefforts of the United Nations, the African Union and \nhumanitarian organizations and institutions currently \nunder way to provide assistance and protection to \npopulations in distress must continue. The adoption of \na comprehensive regional plan for food security and \nself-sufficiency would provide a lasting solution to the \ncurrent crisis. However, Guinea attaches great \nimportance to the positive settlement of the fratricidal \nconflict in Somalia.  \n The Republic of Guinea has always participated \nin the collective effort to promote international peace \nand security, and it seeks to strengthen its role in that \narea. Indeed, my delegation believes that mediation is \nthe most effective tool for the prevention and \nsettlement of conflicts and for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. It is clear that States \nmust create the domestic conditions to prevent and \nsettle disputes with the support of the United Nations.  \n In addition, subregional, regional and \ninternational organizations must adopt mediation \nmechanisms, while working closely with other actors, \nsuch as civil society and youth and women\u2019s \norganizations. In the particular case of Africa, my \ndelegation would hope that priority be given to African \nmediation mechanisms, whose action has shown to be \neffective on several occasions.  \n Given the relevance of the central theme of the \ncurrent session, the Guinean delegation hopes that our \ndebates will further strengthen the role and action of \nour universal Organization. The United Nations is the \ncrucible of our aspirations and the mirror of our \ncollective vision and our joint fight for improved well-\nbeing and peace. To that end, it must pursue in-depth \nreforms of its structures, operation and decision-taking \nmechanisms so as to be more effective and credible. \n I wish to reaffirm the joint African position \nagreed at Ezulwini for fairer representation on the \nSecurity Council. In that regard, Guinea will continue \nto support the action of the Secretary-General, whose \nre-election fills us with great joy. We are convinced \nthat the new mandate will enable him to continue and \nto strengthen his efforts towards achieving the noble \nideals enshrined in the Charter. \n  \n \n11-51191 12 \n \n I could not finish without conveying my \ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-sixth ordinary session. I \nwish him every success in carrying out his difficult \ntask. To his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, I would like \nto express our gratitude for his excellent work during \nhis term."

        "file_text": "More than 10 years ago, \nwe decided to set eight concrete goals to free \nhumankind from extreme poverty, from hunger and \ndisease, and from illiteracy. We called them the \nMillennium Development Goals. These Goals have \nbeen powerful. They have helped the international \ncommunity to monitor and mobilize resources for \ndevelopment cooperation. \n And important progress has been made. We have \nseen poverty decline in many countries. By 2015, the \nglobal poverty rate is expected to fall below 15 per \ncent. We have seen some of the poorest countries make \nthe greatest strides in education. Child mortality has \nbeen reduced. New HIV infections are declining \nsteadily. Access to clean drinking water has increased. \nBut we still have a long way to go in other areas in \norder to raise standards of living and offer equal \nopportunities to people around the globe. \n Today I would like to focus on one key area \nwhere progress is still very slow. But since it affects \nhalf of the world\u2019s population and half its human \nresources, it is of crucial importance. I am referring to \nmaybe the most important human rights failure of all, \nor at least the one that affects the largest number of \nhuman beings. I am referring to the unmet human, \neconomic and social rights of 3.5 billion women and \ngirls. They make up half of the world, but they are not \nallowed to fulfil their potential as powerful drivers of \neconomic development as well as of peace and \nsecurity. \n Let me just fill members in on the situation we \nhave today. Women perform 66 per cent of the world\u2019s \nwork and produce 50 per cent of its food, but they earn \nonly 10 per cent of its income and own one per cent of \nits property. Seventy per cent of the world\u2019s poor \npopulation are women or girls. Every day, \napproximately 1,000 women die from causes related to \npregnancy and childbirth. That adds up to about \n350,000 deaths each year. \n This week we witnessed a historic step in the \nhistory of the United Nations, when Brazilian President \nDilma Rousseff became the first woman ever to open \nthe general debate. At the same time \u2014 standing here, \nmid-2011 \u2014 there are still countries that do not allow \nwomen to vote. And only in 28 countries has women\u2019s \nparliamentary representation reached a critical mass of \n30 per cent or more. Only 19 women lead their \ncountries as elected Heads of State or Government. \nThis is not fair. It is not just. And, frankly, it makes no \nsense. \n To me, gender equality is first and foremost a \nquestion of ensuring equal rights for women and men. \nIt is about giving all individuals, irrespective of gender, \n  \n \n11-51185 42 \n \nthe same possibilities of education, economic \nopportunity and participating in society. In 2011, there \nare women who still do not enjoy equal rights. They \nare refused the rights to vote, to inherit, to work and \neven to drive a car. And at the far end of the spectrum, \nwomen are subject to gender-based violence and rape \nas a weapon of war.  \n But gaps in these rights are not only a loss for the \nwomen affected; they are a loss to society as a whole \nand, I must say, very bad economic policy for the \ncountries concerned. Not least in these times of global \neconomic crisis, it seems obvious that we should \nrealize the full potential of all human resources. \n I will give a few examples. Closing the gap \nbetween male and female employment rates would \nhave huge implications for the global economy. It \nwould boost the United States gross domestic product \n(GDP) by as much as 9 per cent, the eurozone GDP by \n13 per cent and Japanese GDP by as much as 16 per \ncent. But increased gender equality does not merely \nhave immediate economic benefits; it is also an \ninvestment for the future. The evidence from a range of \ncountries is clear. When women take greater control of \nhousehold income, more money is spent on children\u2019s \nneeds, such as food, health and education. Children \ngrow taller, are ill less often and are likely to get better \njobs. Moreover, when women play a greater part in \nsociety by shaping institutions or taking leading roles \nin politics or business life, there are clear \nimprovements for the public good, and corruption is \nlessened. When they are present at the building of \npeace, results improve. \n In short, I see gender equality not only as a \ncrucial human rights issue, but also as a question of \nsmart economics. I would urge all representatives \nsitting in this Hall today to imagine what it would \nmean in terms of economic growth for their countries if \nwomen were allowed to participate fully in society. \n As technology develops, the world is changing. \nIn one minute I can use my mobile phone to get hold of \na friend on the other side of the globe or my children \nback home in Sweden. That is, of course, amazing. But \nin one minute, we can also get a first-hand report on \nthe situation in troubled parts of the world. We can get \nfirst-hand access to pictures of abuse and violence, \ntaken by hidden mobile phones and for the whole \nworld to see. Today, ideas of freedom and democracy \nare spreading at the speed of sound. We have seen it in \nNorth Africa. We are seeing it in the Middle East. The \nInternet and new technology have laid out a high-speed \nmotorway heading towards democracy and freedom. \nWe can see that some are trying to put out roadblocks; \nrepressive Governments try to quash the rights they \nfear. \n The United Nations must play a leading role in \nembracing and maintaining those new roads to \ndemocracy and freedom. The United Nations Special \nRapporteur on the promotion and protection of the \nright to freedom of opinion and expression recently \nconcluded that there must be as little restriction as \npossible of online freedom of expression. He called it \nan enabler of other human rights. Sweden, together \nwith 40 other nations around the world, strongly \nsupports his conclusion. We want to build an alliance \nfor the freedom of the Internet, and we have launched a \nspecial initiative for democratization and freedom of \nexpression so that we can urgently support human \nrights activists and agents of democratic change. The \nInternet is the new front line in the fight for freedom \nacross the world. \n In many countries, my own included, we take \nfreedom for granted. In other countries, it is still a \ndream. This year, we have witnessed courageous \npeople in North Africa and the Middle East taking to \nthe streets to fight for their dream; to fight for freedom, \nopenness and democracy. For this, they must have our \nsupport. When there are threats of genocide, war \ncrimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity \u2014 \nwhen autocratic rulers, as in Syria, turn their guns on \ntheir own citizens \u2014 then the international community \nhas a responsibility to protect civilians. \n Sweden hopes to play its part in this decisive \nphase in the region. We are contributing to the \nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 1970 \n(2011) and 1973 (2011) in Libya. We are providing \nsubstantial humanitarian support to several countries in \nNorth Africa and the Middle East. And when the new \nGovernments turn to the crucial task of establishing \ndemocratic principles, the rule of law and respect for \nhuman rights, we will be ready to continue our support \nand do more to see the Arab Spring turn into a \nblossoming summer. \n The European Union is firmly committed to \nIsrael and a Palestinian State living side by side with \neach other in peace and security. We all want to see the \npeace process resume. Violations of international law \n \n \n43 11-51185 \n \nmust cease. Only then can a true and lasting peace be \nachieved. \n The Horn of Africa is suffering its worst famine \nin 60 years. We are faced with a huge humanitarian \ndisaster. The international community must respond \nfaster and better, now. Disasters such as those in Haiti, \nPakistan and now in the Horn of Africa show the \ncentral importance of the United Nations in \nhumanitarian action. The United Nations needs our full \nsupport to further improve the international response \ncapacity. \n In a globalized world, we are not just \ninterconnected online; together we share a planet with \nfinite resources. And yet we consume as if there was no \ntomorrow. I believe that sustainable development \nrequires global solutions. In this respect, the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development to be \nheld next year in Brazil will be very important. I am \nreally hoping for a strong renewed political commitment to \nsustainable development. \n We are also looking for concrete progress at the \nDurban Climate Change Conference in November. We \nknow what we need and we have known it for some \ntime \u2014 further reductions of greenhouse gas \nemissions. If we do not achieve that, we are simply not \ngoing to be able to reverse the trend of global warming. \n These are turbulent times. Some countries are \nsuffering from financial and economic crises; others \nare suffering from the severe consequences of global \nwarming; yet others are building new societies as \nfreedom and democracy have replaced dictatorships \nand repression. More than ever, there is a need for a \nwell-functioning global arena for international \ncooperation and conflict resolution and for the pursuit \nof sustainable economic, social and environmental \ndevelopment. The need for a strong United Nations,  \n \nbased on political legitimacy, justice and human rights, \nis as strong as ever. Sweden will do its utmost to \nsupport a strong United Nations through substantial \ncontributions to humanitarian and development \nassistance and to its work for peace, security and \nhuman rights. \n We also want to help revitalize the work of the \nUnited Nations on disarmament and non-proliferation. \nTogether with Mexico we will, as co-Chairs of the \nseventh Conference Facilitating the Entry into Force of \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, work \nhard on advancing the Treaty\u2019s entry into force.  \n We have also presented our candidature for a seat \non the Human Rights Council for the period \n2013-2015. As a member of the Council, Sweden \nwould contribute actively to making it a more efficient \nand active body and to promoting the universal \nenjoyment of human rights \u2014 making rights real. \n This week we commemorate the fiftieth \nanniversary of the death of the Swedish Secretary-\nGeneral Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. He played an important \nrole in reforming and shaping the United Nations as we \nknow it today. Let me conclude with these words from \nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld:  \n \u201cThe pursuit of peace and progress, with its trials \nand its errors, its successes and its setbacks, can \nnever be relaxed and never abandoned\u201d.  \nThat was true then and it is true today."

        "file_text": "It is an honour to return once \nagain to this historic setting. May I warmly \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser. Jordanians well remember his distinguished \ntenure as Qatar\u2019s Ambassador to Jordan. I also express \nmy warm congratulations to the Secretary-General on \nhis election to a second term. \n This year, in my region and everywhere in the \nworld, leaders are being asked to listen and to act; to \nsolve today\u2019s serious global crises in the economy, the \nenvironment, and peace; to uphold the equal dignity of \nall persons and, as provided for in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, the equal rights of our nations; to \ncreate more inclusive political and economic life, \nespecially including young people; and to prove that \nglobal justice, by peaceful process of law, is more than \nwords: it is achievable, and achievable now. \n The challenge has come to my region, and \nhistoric transformations are under way. This year, we \nhave witnessed vast changes, both orderly transitions \nand tumultuous events with a high price in bloodshed \nand loss. But those of us who have welcomed and \nchampioned reform are hopeful. We believe that the \nArab Spring can be an opportunity to institutionalize \npositive change \u2014 change that is necessary for a \nstrong, secure and prosperous future. We can build on \nthe pioneering achievements of Arab-Islamic \ncivilization, with its core values of compassion, \nresponsibility, tolerance and respect for others. \n For my country, these opportunities are opening \nthe door to a major revitalization of our reform effort. \nWe want it to be an inclusive, national effort that can \n  \n \n11-50692 38 \n \nreach our goal of parliamentary Government. The \nirreversible democratic change we seek means more \nthan establishing new structures. It means embedding a \nway of life: the active responsibility of participating in \npolitical parties; creating political, economic and social \nplatforms; and working with others to realize the future \nour people need. It also means building reform right \ninto reform, including the rule of law, justice and the \nrights and freedoms of democratic political life. \n Early on, Jordan began a review of the \ncornerstone of our political life, the Constitution. \nParliament is currently putting the final touches on \namendments for ratification by both chambers. Among \nthese key provisions are an independent constitutional \ncourt and an independent elections commission. \n We in Jordan are also working with our partners \nto address another global danger, namely, the immense \nnegative impact of regional conflict. The central \u2014 the \nsingle greatest driver of division and instability \u2014 is \nthe Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  \n We are today at a dangerous impasse. The \nopportunities of a year ago to move talks forward to a \nclear-cut endgame failed to gain momentum. \nNegotiations have come to a halt. Frustrations are at a \npeak. Even as we speak, Israeli settlement activity is \nongoing, despite every ruling of international law and \nin the face of strong international protest.  \n We are seeing settlement activity in Jerusalem, \nalthough that is one of the key final status issues that \ncan only be resolved through negotiations. It is a global \nconcern. In my great-grandfather\u2019s words, a sacred \nchain binds Muslims around the world to that holy city. \nI cannot overstate the crisis that would arise from harm \nto the holy sites of any faith or from efforts to \nannihilate the Arab character of East Jerusalem. \n A two-State solution that ends the conflict by \nmeeting the needs of both sides is, and can be, the only \nsecure and lasting peace. A solution comprised of two \nStates \u2014 a sovereign, independent and viable Palestine \nand Israel, accepted and secure \u2014 is the core of all \nmajor international proposals, including the Arab Peace \nInitiative.  \n All are agreed that negotiations must go forward, \nand soon, resolving the final status of all four key \nissues \u2014 borders, Jerusalem, refugees and settlements. \nOnly then will the conflict cease to be a flashpoint for \nglobal violence, and people on both sides will be able \nto get on with their future in peace. \n President Obama recognized that strategic \nimperative when he set the parameters for a solution on \n19 May. The Arabs viewed these parameters positively. \nIsrael built settlements. The Quartet, the European \nUnion, President Sarkozy and other representatives of \nthe international community have put workable ideas \non the table. The Arab States welcomed them. Israel \nbuilt settlements. That is where we find ourselves \ntoday.  \n We cannot teach the next generation respect for \nlaw and mutual acceptance if they see law and \ncompromise repeatedly fail. Yet we must uphold the \nlaw, or civilization falls. We cannot teach the value of \npeaceful process if peaceful process repeatedly fails. \nYet we must uphold peaceful process, or humankind is \nlost.  \n In this impasse, Jordan and the Arab States are \nholding fast to our principles of peace and law. We \nhave come here - to the house of nations - to seek the \njustice of nations. \n We will continue to strongly support the \ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to Statehood, \nin fulfilment of their aspirations, in accordance with \nUnited Nations resolutions and within a comprehensive \nand just settlement, including the resolution of all final \nstatus issues. It is their right to seek it here, in the \nhome of nations, the United Nations. That we must all \nsupport. \n We seek a new and vigorous international push, \nwith concrete steps toward the endgame. We seek not \nwords, not process, but a decisive end to conflict and a \nnew beginning in peace \u2014 the peace that comes from \nreal Statehood. We seek recognized rights for \nPalestinians \u2014 the rights that allow people to look \nforward in dignity and hope. We seek a peace that \nbrings real security for Israelis \u2014 who will put aside \ntheir fortress mentality and achieve acceptance in their \nneighbourhood and the world. \n Men and women everywhere share basic \nconcerns \u2014 a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies, security to plan for the future, a say in how \nsociety is organized and rights they can depend on. For \ntoo many, these hopes have been unanswered. But a \nnew era is beginning in my region, with new \n \n \n39 11-50692 \n \nopportunities to move forward in democracy, security \nand peace."

        "file_text": "Exactly \neight years ago, in this same context and from this \nsame rostrum, the President of my country, N\u00e9stor \nCarlos Kirchner, addressed the Assembly, four years \nafter having assumed the presidency of the Argentine \nRepublic with only 22 per cent of the vote. Given the \nsituation of the Argentine Republic \u2014 which had fallen \ninto default in 2001, where about a quarter of the \npopulation was unemployed and levels of destitution \nand poverty had exceeded 50 per cent \u2014 he stated that \nthe multilateral credit institutions needed reform, \nparticularly the International Monetary Fund, as did the \npolitical bodies of this honourable Organization. \n President Kirchner made five speeches to the \nGeneral Assembly, and I have made four. This is my \nfourth statement as President of the Republic. In each \nof our addresses we have made the same calls to a \nworld that has changed significantly since 2003, when \nthe Argentine Republic was cast as a black sheep gone \nastray and which found itself in default because of a \ncontinued failure to fulfil its obligations. In reality, we \nwere victims, used as guinea pigs in the experiments of \nthe 1990s and neoliberal policies. \n \n \n25 11-50692 \n \n Much has happened since then, when Argentina \ndefaulted on the largest debt \u2014 at least, so far \u2014 in the \nhistory of humanity, $160 billion. Over the past eight \nyears, Argentina has restructured its debt, reducing it \nfrom 160 per cent to less than 30 per cent of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). The rates of poverty and \nindigence have been reduced to single digits, and we \nmust continue that fight. Our unemployment rate is \namong the lowest, and we have completed the most \nsignificant cycle of economic growth in our 200 years \nof history. \n Among the emerging countries of our region, \nLatin America, Argentina has had the leading growth \nrate and is regularly paying its debt without turning to \ncapital markets. I am not going to list all of the \nnumbers, but they are very compelling. In 2003, we \nspent 2 per cent of GDP on education and 5 per cent on \ndebt payments. Today, Argentina devotes 6.47 per cent \nof its GDP to education and spends 2 per cent to debt \npayment. \n The situation in the world is quite different. Many \nregions and countries have severe problems. Argentina \ndoes not pretend to be a model or an example for \nanyone, but we do wish to reaffirm the need to \nformulate clear rules with regard to the transfer of \ncapital in the area of financial speculation. Many \nspeakers before me, and doubtless many more to come \nwill do the same, have complained about financial \ncommodity speculation, especially in the food sector. \n When we compare the growth of global financial \nstocks to global GDP \u2014 what all of the citizens and \nbusinesses of the world produce in goods and services \u2014 it \nbecomes clear why we are facing a world where \nspeculation is out of control, careening from one side \nto the other and from one country or region to another, \naffecting currencies, economies and the daily lives of \ncitizens, destroying jobs and preventing people from \nobtaining a dignified education and health care. \n If we look at the relationship between global \nGDP and financial stocks in the 1980s, we see that it \nwas a one-to-one relationship. There was a financial \nstock that was exactly equal to the goods and services \nbeing produced by the world. From the 1990s, figures \nskyrocketed. In 2008 total financial stocks, total \nfinancial activity in the world, reached 3.6 times the \nglobal GDP. This meant a tremendous gap between \nwhat we produce and what is in what I call the \u201center \nkey\u201d economy. I call it that because, if we go looking \nfor these shares, they are mere keystrokes transferring \nnumbers from one place to another, from one currency \nto another, producing unparalleled market volatility \nand recurrent crises whereby exchanges go up and \ndown on a daily basis. This not only destroys \nthousands of jobs but also generates immense profits \nthat someone is pocketing. \n We would like to reiterate once again, in the light \nof our own experience \u2014 and I reiterate once again \nthat I do not want to set up a model \u2014 the need for \nmultilateral credit organizations to work extremely \nhard on regulating the global movement of capital and \nfinancial speculation. If this does not happen, it will be \nimpossible to achieve that ever elusive market stability, \nand as a result, the economies of both emerging \ncountries, which have been sustaining the growth of \nthe global economic activity, and developed countries \nalike will be overwhelmed. \n It is crucial that this message be understood, \nbecause today we may see speculation on food; \nyesterday, it was on oil, and tomorrow, it could be on \nlittle candies, if that would be profitable and beneficial \nto the moving of this capital, which gets transferred \nfrom one side of the world to the other without any \ncontrol or regulation whatsoever. \n Here I must say that, as a member of the Group of \n20 at the London meeting \u2014 when it was decided to \ninject an enormous amount of financial resources into \nthe financial sector that was experiencing problems \u2014 \nI maintained that it was necessary to guarantee that \nthose resources being injected into the financial world \ncould later return to the real economy, the concrete \neconomy, to be able to generate employment, products \nand services.  \n Unfortunately, we continue to find ourselves in \nthe same situation, because other than the changes that \nI would describe as purely cosmetic, we have gone no \nfurther with the necessary regulation. \n Moreover, the credit ratings agencies \u2014 which \nbear a great deal of the responsibility for much of what \nhas happened \u2014 rate Argentina, for example, as a \nmarginal economy. Until very recently, they \ncategorized economies on the brink of default higher \nthan that of Argentina. Therefore, transparent \nregulation of the ratings agencies is needed, as they \nbear a great responsibility for the crisis we are \ncurrently seeing in various regions \u2014 which will, of \ncourse, have an impact on all countries. \n  \n \n11-50692 26 \n \n It is regrettable that we have been asking for the \nreform, reorganization and modification of the \nmultilateral credit bodies for so long now. Indeed, we \nbelieve that this task should already have been begun, \nalready formulated, in order to avoid precisely what we \nare experiencing now. For some people it is just a \nmatter of numbers on the stock market, but for others \nthey signal the destruction of the hopes of a lifetime. \n As I was saying to a colleague the other day \nduring a visit to Europe, economic crises always end \nup impacting the political system. There cannot be a \nserious economic crisis, in which millions of people \nfall into poverty and lose their jobs, homes, education \nand health, without that also signalling profound \npolitical transformation. And when such political \ntransformation results in further serious economic \ncrises, the result is experiences that I will not go into \nnow. Totalitarianism often came out of crises. The \ntwentieth century produced crises that were not \nadequately solved by political means. \n I call once again for the reform of this important \nOrganization, which represents multilateralism \u2014 \nsomething we have always consistently defended. We \nneed a more pluralistic and diverse world, and to make \npolitical bodies such as the United Nations, and \ncrucially the Security Council, more democratic. \n We do not agree on the need to expand the \nnumber of permanent members; on the contrary, we \nbelieve that the permanent member category should be \neliminated. The right to veto also should be eliminated, \nas it really prevents the Security Council from carrying \nout the true functions that it had in the bipolar world in \nwhich it was originally conceived. At that time, the \nright to veto was necessary, because in that bipolar \nworld, with the fear of a nuclear holocaust, that right \ngave to Council members the balance necessary to \nensure the security of humankind. Today, that balance \nis broken. Permanent seats and the right to veto are not \nabout defending security or universal stability; rather, \nthey are often about the position of Council members \nexercising their right. \n In my most recent statement before the Assembly \n(see A/65/PV.14), I believe I concluded by expressing \nmy hope that this year Palestine would be become the \n194th Member of the concert of the United Nations. \nMy country, Argentina, like most South American \nnations, has recognized the State of Palestine.  \n I sincerely believe that blocking the entry of \nPalestine could perhaps be seen by some as benefiting \nthe State of Israel. But allow me to say to Assembly \nmembers, on the authority we have as a country that \nhas suffered from the scourge of international \nterrorism, that to prevent Palestine from becoming a \nmember of this Assembly means to continue providing \nalibis to those who engage in international terrorism \nand who in that repudiation find precisely one of the \nfalse arguments they use to justify their crimes.  \n I believe that the non-inclusion of Palestine this \nyear, far from providing greater security and stability \nin the world, will bring about greater insecurity and \nconditions that are utterly unfavourable to what should \nbe the prestige of a body that should represent the \ninterests of all citizens of the world. \n For that reason, I ask that God will enlighten \nthose who must make this historic and structural \ndecision of global significance so that greater balance \ncan be achieved and so that this year Palestine will be \nable to take its seat number 194. I am sure that if we \nsucceed in that endeavour we will help to create a \nworld that is not only safer, but more just. \n I would like to make another point, one linked to \nthe situation that we have been describing, with regard \nto what is shown by the injustice of certain \ncountries \u2014 five, to be exact \u2014 on the Security \nCouncil having veto rights. Once again, we have come \nto the heart of the United Nations to raise an issue that \nis just as vital, and not only to Argentines.  \n The question of sovereignty over the Malvinas \nIslands is also a trial by fire for this body in terms of \nwhether it is possible for it to comply with a policy that \nis essentially multilateral and under which all members \nare obliged to accept the resolutions of this Assembly.  \n Ten General Assembly resolutions have invited \nthe United Kingdom and my country to sit down to \nnegotiate and discuss our sovereignty. Bear in mind \nthat Argentina is not asking for those resolutions to be \nimplemented in terms of recognizing sovereignty. No, \nit is simply asking for compliance with some of the \nprovisions of the 10 United Nations resolutions on the \nmatter.  \n Perhaps we could also list the 29 resolutions of \nthe Special Political and Decolonization Committee \nand the 11 resolutions and 8 declarations of the \nOrganization of American States, as well as the \n \n \n27 11-50692 \n \nresolutions of various forums \u2014 Ibero-American \nforums, the Union of South American Nations, the \nCommon Market of the South, meetings of the Arab \nand African countries \u2014 and the entire world. Through \nsuch resolutions and declarations, all of them have \nbeen demanding that this issue be addressed. The \nUnited Kingdom has systematically refused to do so \nand has obviously used its status as a veto-wielding \nmember of the Security Council to that end.  \n The year 2013 will mark the passage of 180 years \nsince the Argentines were expelled by force of arms \nfrom our Malvinas Islands. Next year will mark \n30 years since an incident \u2014 which the United \nKingdom took advantage of \u2014 that was committed by \nthe most terrible dictatorship in memory, of which we \nArgentines were ourselves victims.  \n I am proud to be the Government that has set an \nexample for the world in terms of human rights and the \nprosecution of those responsible for committing crimes \nand acts of genocide. That is why I believe that \nfocusing on that incident is nothing other than one of \nthe many excuses given to justify non-compliance with \nUnited Nations resolutions. What is worse, I ask all of \nthose who see themselves in the mirror of a future \nworld in which natural resources will be necessary, to \nsee how our natural resources, our fisheries and our \npetroleum resources, are being stolen and illegally \nseized by those who have no right to do so. Obviously, \nI do not feel it necessary to emphasize the fact that no \none can lay claim to an overseas territory that is more \nthan 14,000 kilometres away. That is clearly an illegal \noccupation. \n Once again, we call upon the United Kingdom to \ncomply with the resolutions of the United Nations. \nRecently, there have been genuine provocations, \nincluding missile tests in May and July, which were \ndenounced before the International Maritime \nOrganization, which also suffered one of those attacks. \nOnce again, I reiterate to this Assembly and to the \nUnited Kingdom Argentina\u2019s interest in dialogue. It is \ntrue that much time has passed, however. We state \nhere, before this Assembly, that we will wait for a \nreasonable period of time, but if nothing transpires, we \nwill be forced to begin reviewing the provisional \nunderstandings that are still in effect. We emphasize in \nparticular that the question of sovereignty must be \nincluded in those understandings.  \n Members may ask what I am referring to here. It \nis the joint statement and exchange of letters of 14 July \n1999 on resuming a regular weekly LAN Chile flight \nbetween Punta Arenas and the Malvinas Islands with \ntwo monthly stopovers, one in each direction, in R\u00edo \nGallegos. \n Argentina has no intention of exacerbating the \nsituation for any party, but it is also fair that this \nAssembly and the United Kingdom be aware that there \nmust be compliance with the resolutions. We cannot \nwait 180 years, or 30 years, just as Palestine cannot be \nmaking pilgrimages over the decades to find a place in \nthe world. Still less can the Argentines wait to reclaim \nthe territory that legitimately belongs to us.  \n I cannot conclude without referring to an issue \nthat has been mentioned in all of the statements that \nPresident Kirchner and I have delivered here since \n2003. A few moments ago, when I spoke of the \nquestion of Palestine, my authority to do so \u2014 if \nindeed it gives us authority, as such \u2014 is derived from \nthe fact that we are one of the only two countries in the \nAmericas that have been the target of international \nterrorism.  \n This happened on two occasions. In 1992, there \nwas the explosion at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos \nAires, and in 1994, there was the blast at the Argentine \nIsraelite Mutual Association (AMIA), which is one of \nthe most important mutual associations in Argentina. I \nstress not that it is a Jewish association, but that it is an \nArgentine association. This was an attack on Argentina.  \n I am demanding, on the basis of the requirements \nof Argentine justice, that the Islamic Republic of Iran \nsubmit to the legal authority and in particular allow for \nthose who have been accused of some level of \nparticipation in the AMIA attack to be brought to \njustice.  \n Last year, we proposed here that if they did not \ntrust our country\u2019s justice system, we could take the \napproach that was taken for the Lockerbie case: we \ncould choose a court from a third country, by mutual \nagreement, in order for that court to be able to provide \nthe only thing that we are demanding \u2014 that is, justice. \nWe insist on this because it is a universal demand. It \ndoes not have to do with political positions. This word, \njustice, is in the Talmud, the Bible and the Koran, and, \nfor those who do not believe in anything, I am sure it is \nin their country\u2019s constitution.  \n  \n \n11-50692 28 \n \n The Government of Argentina received, on \n16 July, a message from the Foreign Ministry of Iran \nstating that it intended to cooperate in initiating a \nconstructive dialogue with Argentina in order to help \nus get at the truth with respect to the brutal attack \nagainst the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association of \n18 July 1994. The message that we received from Iran, \nalthough signifying a change of attitude on the part of \nthe Government, does not satisfy our demands, which, \nas I said quite clearly, are for justice.  \n However, it is an offer of dialogue that Argentina \ncannot and must not reject. We are here calling for \ndialogue with the United Kingdom and dialogue among \nall the parties that make up this body. My country does \nthis on the basis of its commitment to fulfilling its \nobligation to resolve controversies through peaceful \nmeans. This attitude has characterized our country \nthroughout our history. This means that in one sense, \nArgentina must put aside the requirements arising from \nour national justice system with respect to prosecuting \nthe presumed perpetrators of these attacks. In another \nsense, we cannot do this, as this is up to judges and \npublic prosecutors.  \n What we would like to say, however, is that we \nthink that this dialogue must be constructive. It must be \na sincere dialogue and must achieve results in order to \nbe credible and therefore not be understood as just a \ndelay tactic or a distraction. \n I will conclude my statement. Sometimes, I think \nof everything that has happened to Argentines. These \nthings have happened to many countries at various \ntimes, but they have all happened to us, in our country, \nduring our history. We have had the worst economic \nand social disaster in living memory. We still have \ntoday a Power exercising a colonial influence in our \ncountry. International terrorism has twice made us the \ntarget of its attacks. So, if we think of it, it is as if all of \nthe problems and all of the tragedies and miseries of \nthis world decided to focus on one single country.  \n Our capacity to recover, in terms of the economy, \nour tireless and never-ending fight to recover what is \nours, our never-ending demand for justice for the \nvictims of the attacks, and the strength that we have \ndrawn from all of these tragedies give me the \nconfidence and certainty that this is the path we have \nchosen: that of achieving growth along with social \ninclusion for our fellow citizens. It is the path of \nensuring that there is unlimited respect for human \nrights, with trials carried out for the sake of \nremembrance, truth and justice. It is the path that \nensures that today, as the President of all Argentines, I \ncan be accompanied here by family members of \nvictims of the AMIA attack. They have confidence that \nthe Government will continue to do what it has always \ndone, which is to defend the values of truth and justice.  \n That is what gives me great hope that God will \nshed light on the path of all those who have to make \ndecisions, not with a view to elections but with a view \nto the destiny of the world in upcoming decades. That \nis why I would like to greet everyone today who has \ntaken the floor or who will take the floor and thank the \nentire Assembly for the support that they have each \ngiven, in all of these causes, to my country, the \nArgentine Republic.

I wish to assure \nhim of India\u2019s full cooperation in the conduct of the \nsixty-sixth session of the Assembly. \n It is also my great pleasure to welcome in our \nmidst the new State of South Sudan. \n We meet during this session of the General \nAssembly at a time of great uncertainty and profound \nchange. Until a few years ago, the world had taken for \ngranted the benefits of globalization and global \ninterdependence. Today we are being called upon to \ncope with the negative dimensions of those very \nphenomena. Economic, social and political events in \ndifferent parts of the world have coalesced, and their \nadverse impact is now being felt across countries and \ncontinents. \n The world economy is in trouble. The shoots of \nrecovery which were visible after the economic and \nfinancial crisis of 2008 have yet to blossom. In many \nrespects, the crisis has deepened even further. \n The traditional engines of the global economy, \nincluding the United States, Europe and Japan, which \nare also the sources of global economic and financial \nstability, are today faced with continued economic \nslowdown. Recessionary trends in those countries are \naffecting confidence in world financial and capital \nmarkets. These developments are bound to have a \nnegative impact on developing countries, which also \nhave to bear the additional burden of inflationary \npressures. \n There has been unprecedented social and political \nupheaval in West Asia, the Gulf and North Africa. The \npeoples of those regions are demanding the right to \nshape their own future. Energy and food prices are \nonce again spiralling and introducing fresh instability, \nespecially for developing countries. \n The Palestinian question remains unresolved and \na source of great instability and violence. India is \nsteadfast in its support for the Palestinian people\u2019s \nstruggle for a sovereign, independent, viable and united \nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \nliving within secure and recognizable borders side by \nside and at peace with Israel. We look forward to \nwelcoming Palestine as an equal Member of the United \nNations. \n Terrorism continues to rear its ugly head and take \na grievous toll of innocent lives. New threats to \ninternational security have emerged. At a time when \nthe world needs more international commerce, the sea \nlanes of communication across the Indian Ocean are \nunder siege. Acts of piracy are being carried out with \nimpunity from lands that are beyond the writ of any \nfunctioning State or international accountability. \n Iniquitous growth, inadequate job and education \nopportunities and the denial of basic human freedoms \nare leading to a growing radicalization of the youth, \nintolerance and extremism. \n  \n \n11-51360 10 \n \n We have no choice but to meet these challenges \nhead-on. We will succeed if we adopt a cooperative \nrather than a confrontational approach. We will \nsucceed if we embrace once again the principles on \nwhich the United Nations was founded: \ninternationalism and multilateralism. More importantly, \nwe will succeed if our efforts have legitimacy and are \npursued not just within the framework of the law but \nalso in the spirit of the law. \n The observance of the rule of law is as important \nin international affairs as it is within countries. \nSocieties cannot be reordered from outside through \nmilitary force. People in all countries have the right to \nchoose their own destiny and decide their own future. \n The international community has a role to play in \nassisting in the processes of transition and institution-\nbuilding, but the idea that prescriptions should be \nimposed from outside is fraught with danger. \n Action taken under the authority of the United \nNations must respect the unity, territorial integrity, \nsovereignty and independence of individual States. \nCorrespondingly, governments are duty-bound to their \ncitizens to create conditions that enable them to freely \ndetermine their pathways to development. This is the \nessence of democracy and fundamental human \nfreedoms. \n There are many other things that we can do. We \nmust address the issue of the deficit in global \ngovernance. We need a stronger and more effective \nUnited Nations. We need a United Nations that is \nsensitive to the aspirations of everyone, rich or poor, \nbig or small. For this, the United Nations and its \nprincipal organs, the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council, must be revitalized and reformed. \n The reform and expansion of the Security \nCouncil are essential if it is to reflect contemporary \nreality. Such an outcome will enhance the Council\u2019s \ncredibility and effectiveness in dealing with global \nissues. Early reform of the Security Council must be \npursued with renewed vigour and urgently enacted. \n We should not allow the global economic \nslowdown to become a pretext for building walls \naround ourselves through protectionism or erecting \nbarriers to the movement of people, services and \ncapital. Effective ways and means must be deployed to \npromote the coordination of the macroeconomic \npolicies of the major economies. The reform of the \ngovernance systems of international financial \ninstitutions should be pursued with speed and \nefficiency. \n The development agenda must be brought firmly \nback to centre stage in United Nations priorities. We \nneed a much more determined effort to ensure \nbalanced, inclusive and sustainable development for \nthe benefit of vast sections of humanity. Each of us can \ncontribute to this task, but we can achieve far more if \nwe act in partnership. \n In the past few decades, India has lifted tens of \nmillions of its people out of abject poverty. We are in a \nposition to feed our population better, educate them \nbetter and widen their economic choices. However, we \nstill have a very long way to go. \n We wish to accelerate the pace of India\u2019s \ntransformation in partnership with the international \ncommunity. A fast-growing India can expand the \nboundaries of the global economy. A democratic, plural \nand secular India can contribute to tolerance and \npeaceful coexistence among nations. \n Developing countries need investment, \ntechnology and market access for their products. They \nneed assistance in the areas of education, health, \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and agriculture. During the \nrecently held fourth United Nations Conference on the \nLeast Developed Countries Conference in Istanbul in \nMay 2011, India strengthened its partnership with the \nleast developed countries through significantly \nenhanced lines of credit and assistance in capacity-\nbuilding. \n We should pay particular attention to Africa. \nAfrica\u2019s richest resources are not its minerals but its \npeople. We must empower them and open the doors for \nthem to human advances through technology, education \nand skills development. \n At the second India-Africa Forum Summit in \nAddis Ababa earlier this year, India offered lines of \ncredit worth $5 billion and an additional $700 million \nin grant assistance for human resource development, \ntechnology transfer and building new institutions. \n The United Nations should lead efforts in the area \nof food security. We need more cooperation in \nagricultural technologies, water conservation, land \nusage and productivity, and stability in commodity \nprices. \n \n \n11 11-51360 \n \n Developing countries need a peaceful external \nenvironment in which to grow. The fight against \nterrorism must be unrelenting. There cannot be \nselective approaches in dealing with terrorist groups or \nthe infrastructure of terrorism. Terrorism has to be \nfought across all fronts. In South Asia there are \nencouraging signs of cooperation in the area of \nsecurity, as exemplified in India\u2019s cooperation with \nBangladesh. Such cooperation is adding to the security \nof both our countries. \n However, the recent assassination of \nMr. Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul is a chilling \nreminder of the designs of the enemies of peace in \nAfghanistan. It is essential that the process of nation-\nbuilding and reconciliation in that country succeed. \nThis is vital for ensuring peace and security in the \nregion. India will play its part in helping the people of \nAfghanistan build a better future for themselves, just as \nwe are doing in other countries in South Asia. We will \ndo so because prosperity and stability in our region are \nindivisible. \n We wish to see an open, inclusive and transparent \narchitecture of regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific \nregion and peaceful settlement of disputes. I call upon \nthe United Nations to evolve a comprehensive and \neffective response to the problem of piracy in the Red \nSea and off the coast of Somalia. As a littoral State of \nthe Indian Ocean, India is ready to work with other \ncountries in that regard. Simultaneously, the \ninternational community should continue with efforts \nto restore stability in Somalia. We have joined \ninternational efforts to provide humanitarian assistance \nto the countries afflicted with severe famine and \ndrought in the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia, \nKenya and Djibouti. \n Nuclear proliferation continues to be a threat to \ninternational security. The action plan put forward by \nformer Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-\nweapon-free and non-violent world provides, even \ntoday, a concrete road map for achieving nuclear \ndisarmament in a time-bound, universal, \nnon-discriminatory, phased and verifiable manner. I \ncommend the United Nations for its efforts in focusing \nworld attention on nuclear safety. Our plans for \nutilizing nuclear power to meet our energy needs hinge \non full satisfaction of our concerns about the safety of \nnuclear energy. We have undertaken a thorough review \nof the safety of our nuclear plants. \n The perspectives I have outlined to the Assembly \nare those that have guided our actions in the Security \nCouncil since India became a non-permanent member \nof the Council in January. There are still millions of \npeople living in poverty across the world. Their plight \nhas worsened, through no fault of theirs, due to the \nglobal economic and financial crisis of recent years. \nThe actions of Governments around the world are \ntherefore under close scrutiny. It is vitally important \nthat through our actions and deeds we renew the \npeople\u2019s faith in the Charter and objectives of the \nUnited Nations. I am confident that we can do this \nthrough acts of statesmanship, foresight and collective \neffort. India stands ready to play its part in this noble \nendeavour."

        "file_text": "I am pleased to convey \nmy greetings to the President and to offer him the \ncongratulations of my Government and the delegation \nof Barbados on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at this sixty-sixth session. Those of us who \nare familiar with the very high standards to which he \nroutinely subscribes confidently expect him to steer the \ndeliberations of this session with his accustomed calm \nand skill. It is appropriate that I also commend his \npredecessor in office, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for the aplomb \nwith which he guided the deliberations of the sixty-\nfifth session of this Assembly. \n I am also pleased to congratulate Mr. Ban \nKi-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. I \nacknowledge the sterling work that he has done over \nthe past five years, and wish him a successful second \nterm.  \n I am especially delighted to extend \ncongratulations to the Government and people of the \n  \n \n11-51360 44 \n \nRepublic of South Sudan on their achievement of \nindependence. On behalf of the Government and \npeople of Barbados, I reiterate our support and \nsolidarity on South Sudan\u2019s admission to the United \nNations as its 193rd Member. \n It is with genuine pleasure that I address the \nAssembly today in my capacity as Prime Minister of \nBarbados. The untimely death 11 months ago of my \npredecessor in office placed on my shoulders the \nprimary responsibility of pursuing the ideals to which \nBarbados is committed both at home and abroad. \n Some 45 years ago, our first Prime Minister, in \nhis maiden address to this Assembly, articulated our \nposition in the following terms:  \n \u201cThe people of Barbados do not draw a dividing \nline between their internal affairs and their \nforeign policy. They strive in their domestic \narrangements to create a just society for \nthemselves. In their Constitution they affirm \nrespect for the rule of law; they also declare their \nintention to establish and maintain the kind of \nsociety which enables each citizen, to the full \nextent of his capacity, to play his part in national \nlife \u2026 In thus charting our domestic course, we \ncan have no interest in a foreign policy that \ncontradicts our national goals \u2026 [W]e are \nexponents, not of the diplomacy of power, but of \nthe diplomacy of peace and prosperity.\u201d \n(A/PV.1487, paras. 75-78) \n Much, of course, has changed since then. The \nworld we know today is vastly different from the world \nof 1966, yet we continue to keep faith with the vision \nof the father of our independence. My task in \naddressing the General Assembly on matters of foreign \npolicy is therefore, paradoxically, at once easy and \ndifficult. It is easy because we still adhere to our \nfoundational principles; it is difficult because we now \nhave to apply them in a world that has grown much \nmore complex, much more volatile and much more \ndangerous. \n If we need further proof that we live in an \ninterconnected world, the present economic downturn \nprovides a painful reminder. When large economies \nsuch as those of the United States and Europe are \nreeling, one may well imagine the toll that the worst \ncrisis since the Great Depression is taking on small \nvulnerable societies like those that populate the \nCaribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. \n We in Barbados have chosen to withstand the \neconomic storms that assail us by relying on the good \njudgment of our people to come together in times of \nperil. My Government has partnered with the business \ncommunity and the trade union movement to ensure \nthat layoffs and wage demands alike are kept to an \nabsolute minimum so that the gain and the pain are \nshared equitably. We are committed to protecting the \nmost vulnerable among us because it is our settled \nconviction that a nation is more than just an economy; \nit is also a society. \n The cruel irony of the current downturn is that it \nmight have been avoided if corporations had restrained \ntheir greed and Government oversight and regulation at \nthe international, regional and national levels had been \nmore vigorous and rigorous. This highlights the urgent \nneed for a new architecture of global finance that will \nrender unlikely the prospect of our lurching from one \ncrisis to another, and lay the groundwork for a smooth \nand balanced economic recovery that avoids the \nmassive social dislocations we are now witnessing. \nRecovery that comes at the expense of the poorest and \nmost vulnerable in our societies is not only \nunenlightened economics, but also very dangerous \npolitics. \n We in Barbados have welcomed the rise of the \nglobal economy in the past two decades, since it has \nthe potential for creating prosperity for all nations. But \nit will realize its potential only if the increasingly \nvolatile flows of international capital are governed by \nfair and transparent rules. In laying down an orderly \nframework for global financial and economic \ntransactions, we urge that the international community \napply the principle enunciated by Aristotle upwards of \n2,000 years ago that there should be equality between \nequals and proportionality between unequals. \n Barbados believes that the path to prosperity lies \nin open economies, open societies and open \nGovernments, and is constantly positioning itself to \ncompete as a fully compliant, transparent, rules-\ngoverned global entrepreneurial and financial centre. \n Yet, to our dismay, we find that the rich and \npowerful keep changing the rules to their advantage \nand to our disadvantage. It is a violation both of fair \nplay and of common sense to move the goalposts while \nthe game is in progress. Let it be clearly understood \nthat, on this issue, it is not charity we seek; it is justice \nwe demand. \n \n \n45 11-51360 \n \n However, none of the nations represented in this \nAssembly will enjoy sustainable prosperity if we \ncontinue to abuse the environment which we hold in \nsacred trust for future generations. It is an inconvenient \ntruth that the success of humankind\u2019s development \ngoals will depend on the ability of our planet to sustain \nour consumption and production activities. We must be \ncautious, therefore, about how we use fossil fuels, \nabout carbon emission levels and about the unregulated \ntreatment of waste. The planet has now begun to \nprotest through dramatic changes in climate and the \nprospect of sea-level rise. The very existence of small \nisland States like those in the Caribbean and the Pacific \ncould be imperilled if current trends are not halted or \nreversed. \n Barbados has been an active participant in the \nenvironmental movement since the 1992 United \nNations Conference on Environment and Development \nin Rio. We are proud to have hosted the first Global \nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small \nIsland States in 1994 and continue to work with other \nsmall island developing States to update and improve \nthe Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \nStrategy for its further implementation. We continue to \nwork also towards the success of the 2012 United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development. \n I am deeply honoured to have been asked to serve \non the Secretary-General\u2019s High-Level Panel on Global \nSustainability. That our task is challenging no one will \ndeny, required as we are to formulate a blueprint for \neconomic growth and prosperity that focuses on the \neradication of poverty, while ensuring greater equality \nand inclusion and reducing the devastating impact of \nhuman activities on ecosystems and the environment. \nThe work of the Panel is progressing smoothly, and I \nassure the Assembly that my colleagues and I have \nreadily accepted the challenge. \n Without peace and security, it is difficult to create \nand maintain the social conditions that constitute a \nprerequisite for economic progress and prosperity. The \nprotracted conflict in the Middle East between Israel \nand the Palestinians has become a disturbing anomaly \nin a world where so many other disputes have been \npeacefully resolved. It is an anomaly because everyone \nknows what the solution is. It is disturbing because the \nonly thing preventing a resolution of the issue is an \nunhappy convergence of dysfunctional political \ncurrents at the domestic level. \n The State of Israel has a right to exist, and the \npeople of Israel have a right to live in security and to \ndo so with the full and undisputed recognition of the \nrest of the world. On the other hand, the Palestinians \nare entitled also to enjoy the fruits of prosperity within \ntheir own sovereign State. Much else in this conflict \nmay be negotiable. Surely, those two postulates are not. \nThe Holy Land has for centuries been the locus of \nhumanity\u2019s hopes. It is high time that it now become a \nsymbol, not of humanity\u2019s divisions, but of humanity\u2019s \nunity. This state of affairs will ensue only when the \ndisgracefully long wait of the Palestinians for a \nhomeland is brought to an end. \n In a similar vein, the Government and the people \nof Barbados fully embrace Cuba as an important \npartner in the Caribbean region and, since 1972, have \ncommitted themselves to a policy of constructive \nengagement with its Government and people. Barbados \nrespects the sovereign rights of Cuba and supports \nunequivocally its full integration into our hemisphere. \nBarbados does not believe that actions such as the \ndecades-long economic embargo aimed at isolating \nCuba, or any other measures that create greater \nhardship for the Cuban people, will facilitate the full \nintegration which we consider to be both desirable and \nnecessary. My delegation thinks, therefore, that the \neconomic embargo against Cuba has long outlived its \nusefulness and should be lifted. \n Barbados remains committed also to supporting \nthe development and the advancement of the people of \nHaiti. For my delegation, the reconstruction of Haiti, \nincluding the rebuilding of its democratic institutions, \ncontinues to be a high priority. We fully support the \ncall made in July by the Heads of State and \nGovernment of the Caribbean Community for the \ninternational community to fulfil its pledges to finance \nthe reconstruction of Haiti following the devastation of \nthe earthquake that occurred in January 2010. \n Terrorism, whether emanating from States or \nfrom non-State actors, is an attack on what we have \nalways known to be the core values of the \nOrganization. I speak of the rule of law; the protection \nof civilians; mutual respect between people of different \nfaiths and cultures; and the peaceful resolution of \nconflict. \n It is the view of my delegation that the United \nNations must be the foremost form of collective \nsecurity against terrorism, convinced as we are that \n  \n \n11-51360 46 \n \nwhile terrorism may arise out of conditions of \ninsecurity and deprivation, it should never be accepted \nor justified in the pursuit of any cause whatsoever. \n Barbados therefore continues to be an active and \ncommitted partner in global efforts to combat terrorism \nand other transnational criminal activities. We have \nexperienced first-hand the deleterious effects on our \nsocieties of the illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons. At their Summit in July 2011, CARICOM \nHeads of Government committed themselves to accord \nthe highest national and regional priority to combating \nand eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons and their ammunition. \n We have a vested interest, therefore, in the \nsuccess of the United Nations Conference on the Arms \nTrade Treaty, to be held in 2012. We will continue to \nwork with other Member States to achieve the ultimate \nobjective of a legally binding, robust and \ncomprehensive Arms Trade Treaty which imposes the \nhighest possible standards for the transfer of \nconventional arms, including small arms, light \nweapons and ammunition. \n Much has changed since the formation of the \nUnited Nations in 1945. Some of the global challenges \nwe face today, such as the pandemics of HIV/AIDS and \nnon-communicable diseases, climate change, the \ngrowth of the illicit drug trade, transnational crime and \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, are \nnew. Others, including extreme poverty, genocide, \nterrorism and civil conflict, are old. Yet the need for \nthe United Nations remains as pressing today as it was \nat the time of its formation. While the United Nations \nis an organization of sovereign States, it exists to serve \nthe needs of all the peoples of the world. \n We need to be constantly reminded, therefore, \nthat even if he can vote to choose his Government, a \nyoung man living with AIDS who faces daily \ndiscrimination is not truly free. Even if she earns a \ncomfortable living, a woman who lives in fear of daily \nviolence and has no say in how her country is run is \nnot truly free. Even if he enjoys freedom of speech and \nassembly, a young man dying of hunger is not truly \nfree. Freedom to live in dignity, freedom from fear and \nfreedom from want are inextricably connected. Indeed, \nall people, wherever they can be found, have the right \nto security and to development. \n As Member States, we must recommit ourselves, \ntherefore, to realizing the ideals of the Organization, \nbearing in mind that commitment to the pragmatic and \nthe possible must sometimes be our steppingstone to \nthe realization of the ideal. That approach, Barbados is \nconvinced, is an infallible way of giving effect to the \ndetermination of the founders of the United Nations \u201cto \nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d \nand \u201cto promote social progress and better standards of \nlife in larger freedom\u201d."

        "file_text": "First, I would like to \nextend my heartfelt congratulations to the President of \nthe General Assembly on his election. I wish him every \nsuccess in leading the work of the Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. I would like to express my \ngratitude to his predecessor for his invaluable \ncontribution. May I also take this opportunity to extend \nspecial thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nhis excellent organization of this session and for his \nwise and determined leadership at the helm of the \n \n \n29 11-51360 \n \nUnited Nations over the past few years. I wish him the \nutmost success over the four years ahead. \n Our world today is experiencing major and \ncomplex crises that threaten the peace and stability of \nseveral regions and our planet as a whole. However, \nthis year\u2019s spring was a great and historic one for \nAfrica and the entire world. More than 125 million \noppressed people stood up with courage, determination \nand sacrifice and overthrew tyrannical regimes in five \ncountries in Africa and opened the gates of freedom for \ntheir nations. \n As a representative of a country that only 20 \nyears ago brought down the Hoxhaist dictatorship \u2014 \nthe worst that Albania and Europe had ever known \u2014 I \nwould like to cordially welcome and salute the \nrepresentatives of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, South Sudan \nand Ivory Coast who are present at this Assembly \nsession. Today, we pay tribute to the thousands of \ncitizens of those countries who with great courage and \nlegendary bravery lost their lives in order to liberate \ntheir countries from ruthless tyrannies and who made \ntheir countries, the African continent and the entire \nworld more free and more just than ever. With their \nsacrifices, however, those who fought and fell in the \nname of freedom have delivered a sacred message to \nthe very hearts and minds of all oppressed people on \nour planet: Be not afraid! \n On the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the \ncommunist dictatorship, despite the unquestionable \ndifficulties inherent in building a democracy based on \nmarket values, Albania has continuously affirmed that \nfor the individual, our society and our nation as a \nwhole freedom is the greatest of all assets and riches. \n Twenty years ago, Albania was one of the three \npoorest countries in the world, plagued by extreme \npoverty and chronic starvation. Today, Albania belongs \nto the group of countries with middle to upper income \nlevels. Formerly a totally hyper-collectivized country, \ntoday it has the smallest public sector in Europe, with \nmore than 84 per cent of its gross domestic product \n(GDP) coming from the private sector. \n Twenty years ago, human rights and freedoms \nwere forbidden under the country\u2019s Constitution. \nToday, Albania is a country with a functional \ndemocracy, freedom of speech and free elections and in \nwhich there is full respect for minority rights and \nreligious tolerance par excellence. \n Albania was the most isolated country in the \nworld. Now, it is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty \nalliance and makes its contribution to peace and \nstability in the region and beyond, while remaining \nfirmly focused on its path towards European Union \nintegration. Today, Albanians travel freely throughout \nEurope, while the number of foreign citizens who have \nvisited Albania for tourism and other purposes has \nincreased, from 300,000 in 2004 to 3.5 million last \nyear. \n Recently, during this period of major European \nand global financial crises, Albania\u2019s economy \nremained one of the few in the world that did not \nexperience a recession. The United Nations Conference \non Trade and Development estimates that global \nforeign direct investment decreased by 37 per cent \nfrom 2007 to 2010, while the same source confirms \nthat in Albania it grew by 316 per cent from 2006 to \n2010.\n Over the past few years, Albanian exports have \ngrown by 300 per cent. Unemployment has decreased, \nand so has poverty, by a margin of some 30 per cent. \nOur economic model is based entirely on economic \nfreedom. Last year, that freedom suffered a major \nsetback worldwide, whereas in my country it increased \nby 16 per cent. \n The Albanian economy is not detached from the \nglobal economy. In fact, the opposite is true: being a \nsmall economy, it is linked to and affected by it. That is \nwhy I believe that four main factors determine its \nperformance. \n The first factor is a small government and public \nsector. Albania\u2019s public administration and public \nsector are at least 50 per cent smaller than those of any \nother similarly sized country in the region and beyond. \nFurthermore, I am pleased to state that my Government \nranks among the top 10 Governments with the lowest \nlevel of interference in the economy. \n Secondly, Albania is a country of flat-rate taxes. \nAt 10 per cent, its fiscal burden is the lowest in \nEurope. The increase in fiscal freedoms and the \nsuccessful fight against corruption allowed our country \nto double its budgetary revenue from customs and \ntaxes in four years\u2019 time. \n  \n \n11-51360 30 \n \n Thirdly, we invested heavily in infrastructure to \nstimulate growth. My Government has spent 8 per cent \nto 10 per cent of our GDP on road infrastructure alone, \nthree years in a row. A total of 8,000 km of new roads \nhave been constructed, more than in the entire history \nof the country. Within the next two years, Albania will \nhave a new and modern road infrastructure that will \nallow our citizens as well as foreign visitors to reach \nour capital, Tirana, from any part of the country in \n60 per cent less time than previously required. \n Fourthly, we have made it easier to open a \nbusiness or expand an existing one by putting in place \nan efficient digital one-stop-shopping system for \nbusiness registrations, licences and permits, and by \ndrastically reducing bureaucratic procedures. \n Yet the debt and the euro crisis are hanging like \nthe sword of Damocles over our national currency, the \nlek, and our economy. I take this opportunity to call \nupon the countries of the eurozone to take into \nconsideration the effects of the crisis on our economy \nand others that are closely linked to the euro. \n The greatest desire and fondest dream of all \nAlbanians is to see Albania become a developed \ncountry. I know that the road ahead of us is not \nsmooth; it may be bumpy at times, but it is also the one \nthat will take us higher and higher. I am convinced that \nit is a righteous and a sure path of hope by which the \ndream of a fully developed Albania will come true. \n To achieve that dream, the Government of \nAlbania is committed to sustainable development. \nDeveloping countries and emerging markets such as \nthat of Albania face countless difficulties, but they also \nhave the advantage of learning from the mistakes of \ndeveloped countries and being able to avoid them. \nWith that in mind, we are determined to turn Albania \ninto a small superpower of renewable energy in the \nregion. With its rich water resources, Albania \nresembles a small Norway on the Balkan peninsula. \nMy Government has already signed with the private \nsector a concessional contract for the construction of \n220 of the 450 hydropower stations that are to be built. \nCompanies from all over Europe and the rest of the \nworld are already engaged in that process. \n Additionally, major natural wind platforms exist \nthroughout the country, and the Government has given \nand is giving licenses for the production of thousands \nof megawatts of electricity by wind parks. Albania is \nalso one of the sunniest places in Europe, and the \nGovernment is determined to exploit solar as well as \ngeothermal energy. \n I believe that in addition to the major efforts \nnecessary to achieve an international legal framework \nto prevent global warming and lower greenhouse-gas \nemissions, we must speedily reach an agreement \nstipulating that a percentage of the aid that generous \ndonors are offering to support this cause be used for \nthe purpose of supporting private-sector companies \nthat are focused on renewable energy projects. Such \nfunds could be used to cover the cost of the loan \ninterest incurred in realizing renewable energy \nprojects. I am sure that they will increase manifold the \nproduction of renewable energy in the very near future. \n To combat climate change and improve \nenvironmental conditions, forestation is also very \nimportant. The United Nations Billion Tree Campaign \nhas been met with a successful response by many \ncountries and deserves credit as a first important step. \nHowever, our potential is much greater. \n The Government of Albania has started an \nambitious programme aimed at taking advantage of our \ncountry\u2019s potential in terms of fruit trees. We intend to \nplant, in the next eight years, some 50 million olive \ntrees and around 200 million nut trees of different \nvarieties. The project, which started two years ago, is \nsubsidized by public funds. I am pleased to inform the \nAssembly that this project is moving rapidly ahead and \nthat it has given rise to a real and unprecedented tree-\nplanting passion on the part of my fellow citizens. \nAlbania will welcome any and all help from the United \nNations and its Member States to successfully \ncomplete this project. \n Albania fully supports the Open Government \nPartnership initiated by the President of the United \nStates, Barack Obama, and the President of Brazil, \nDilma Rousseff; that is why we have joined the \ninitiative. Our efforts towards an open Government \nhave as a primary objective the project entitled \n\u201cAlbania in the digital age\u201d. In a short time, we have \nexpanded access to the Internet to all our schools and \nhave started offering free Internet service to every \ncitizen in all post offices throughout the country. \n A total of 2.1 million Albanians have availed \nthemselves of this opportunity and have surfed the \nInternet, many of them for the first time in their lives. \nThis has helped increase the percentage of the \npopulation in Albania using the Internet from a mere \n \n \n31 11-51360 \n \n4.8 per cent in early 2006 to 60 per cent today \u2014 \nroughly two thirds of the population. Free Internet \nservice will continue to be available in all post offices \nand in some additional offices to be opened for that \npurpose. Moreover, the Government is fully committed \nto making super-broadband Internet available over the \nnext two years and to guaranteeing one-stop-shopping \nservices to citizens throughout the country. \n We believe that the digital age is above all the \nage of transparency. Based on this belief, Albania two \nyears ago became the first country in the world with a \n100 per cent electronic procurement system certified \nby the United Nations. That system has led to a sixfold \nincrease in participating public bids, reducing \nprocurement costs by 27 per cent. Today Albania is a \ncountry featuring e-tax, e-customs, e-university \nadmissions, and e-business registration and e-civil \nstatus registry. The Government intends to offer all \nthose services and others in a one-stop-shop context in \nthe very near future. \n E-government and transparency strengthen \ndemocracy, and our law also guarantees free access for \nour citizens to all acts, decisions and public \nexpenditures of the Government. In order to strengthen \nthe role of civil society, my Government has for the \npast two years had a specific budgetary provision in \nthat respect that is entirely administered by an \nindependent board of civil society. \n Albania has excellent relations with its immediate \nneighbours and, in general, with the countries of the \nregion. We would like to develop and consolidate \nfurther relations with the Republic of Serbia as well. I \nam very pleased to inform the Assembly that the \nGovernment of Kosovo possesses an equally strong \nwill in the area of good-neighbourly relations and has \nshown assiduous commitment and seriousness in the \nprocess of negotiations in Brussels. The International \nCourt of Justice decided in July last year in The Hague \nthat Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence was in full \ncompliance with international law.  \n The Republic of Kosovo has been recognized by \nmore than 80 States, and I take this opportunity to call \nupon the rest of the States Members of the United \nNations to recognize the independent republic of \nKosovo, which has become, in fact, an important factor \nfor peace, stability and cooperation in our region. I also \ncall upon Serbia, which went through the General \nAssembly to ask the opinion of the International Court \nof Justice, to adapt its position in line with the decision \nof the Court, thus demonstrating that it accepts and \nrespects international law in its entirety and not only \nthose parts that serve its cause. \n In accordance with President Ahtisaari\u2019s package, \nand in close cooperation with the European Union Rule \nof Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), the International \nSecurity Force in Kosovo (KFOR) and other \ninternational institutions present in the country, the \nrepublic of Kosovo has put in place and implemented \nthe highest standards in the region and beyond as \nregards the freedoms and rights of minorities. \n The most worrying problems for the Serbs in \nKosovo today are the tensions created and orchestrated \nfor nationalistic purposes. Serbian cultural heritage in \nKosovo is today more secure than ever. It is a precious \ncultural heritage not only for the Serbs in Kosovo but \nalso for Albanians and all other citizens of Kosovo, as \nwell as for Serbia, the entire region and the whole of \nEurope. I would like to reassure the representatives of \nthe Member States that the only threat Serbs in Kosovo \nface is that of being exploited to serve the purposes of \na bitter past that must not ever return. \n Meanwhile, inter-ethnic relations in all areas \nwhere Serbs and Albanians live together in the same \ncommunities are very good. However, the parallel \nstructures funded by Belgrade in the three Serbian \nhomogeneous communes in northern Mitrovica, where \nno other ethnic groups reside, have turned them into a \nsafe haven for organized crime and smuggling and \ntrafficking of all sorts.  \n The Government of the republic of Kosovo is \ndetermined to implement the rule of law in those \ncommunes and engage in effective border and customs \ncontrol, in full compliance with the agreement reached \nin Brussels and the Ahtisaari document. Those efforts, \nhowever, have met strong resistance from criminal \ngroups and organized gangs that, with weapons and \nother means, are doing all in their power to block the \nrule of law. We have supported and will continue to \nsupport the Government of Kosovo, EULEX and \nKFOR in their efforts to strengthen law and order in all \nthe territory of the republic of Kosovo so that peace \nand stability will prevail.  \n I also call on Serbia to do its best to remove the \nobstacles to the flow of goods across its border with \nKosovo, and to respect the agreement signed this \nmonth in Brussels, which forbids the embargo and \n  \n \n11-51360 32 \n \nprovides for freedom of export and import for both \ncountries. We believe that respect for the actual borders \nin the Balkans is a fundamental condition for lasting \npeace and stability. Belgrade\u2019s efforts to keep parallel \nstructures of authority in place in those three \ncommunes demonstrate that it still believes in \nreshaping borders in our region based on the failed and \nlong-outdated idea of ethnically clean countries and the \nconcept of Greater Serbia. \n The Republic of Serbia, in accordance with \ninternational law, has arrested the butcher of the \nBalkans and, albeit too late, his lieutenants as well, and \nhas received the due appreciation of the international \ncommunity for doing so. However, I invite Serbia to \ncooperate in the search for and return of the remains of \n1,500 men, women, children and elderly who were \nabducted from their homes and massacred in the \nterritory of Serbia only because they were Albanians. It \nis very important to cleanse one\u2019s country of those who \nhave committed crimes against humanity, but it is also \nimportant not to hide or cover over the graves of their \nvictims.  \n Here yesterday, President Tadic characterized as \ntrue the accusations raised by Mr. Dick Marty \nregarding the alleged traffic in organs and mass \nkillings committed by Albanians in the territory of \nAlbania. Regarding that report, I would like to state \nhere the stance of the Albanian Government. Dick \nMarty\u2019s report \u2014 as acknowledged by the Chief \nProsecutor of Serbia, Vladimir Vukcevic, who has \nstated that his own report is fully included in Marty\u2019s \nreport \u2014 is in fact a cut-and-paste of the Vukcevic\u2019s \nreport. Every person who reads that report sees that it \nraises many allegations that are not at all based on \nfacts or the truth but rather motivated by sinister \nintention.  \n The Dick Marty report \u2014 or rather let us call it \nthe Dick Marty/Vukcevic report \u2014 does not produce \neven a single fact. I must clarify that in fact it \nsynthesizes Carla Del Ponte\u2019s memoir, which seem to \nhave derived from the same unique source. In the \nthousands of pages of transcripts of the interrogation of \nSlobodan Milo\u0161evic and his accusations against \nAlbanians, there is not a single word of accusation on \nhis part about organ trafficking or mass graves in my \ncountry. The purpose of the report is to divert attention \nfrom the decision of the International Court of Justice \nin favour of the independence of Kosovo. \n Nevertheless, the Government of Albania has \nofficially asked its delegation in the Council of Europe \nto vote to endorse the report for the sole purpose of \nopening the door to a thorough international \ninvestigation. My Government sent an invitation to \nEULEX, and we welcome the fact the EULEX \naccepted it. I assure everyone here that my country will \nfully cooperate fully with EULEX and its task force so \nthat the truth about such inventions will be made \nknown. When I read them for the first time in Carla \nDel Ponte\u2019s memoir, they reminded me of Agatha \nChristie. I want the EULEX team to come and clarify \neverything about those fictions. \n Despite all this, our region has made \nextraordinary progress, and efforts to cooperate in \nbuilding a common future in the European Union are \nprevailing every day. My country is doing its best and \nis investing heavily in infrastructure to create new \nlinks, new roads and new lines of communication with \nall our neighbours. I believe that the time has come \nwhen Albanians and Serbs will try to start archiving the \npast and looking for a common future in the best \ninterests of their nations.  \n From this rostrum, President Abbas made his \nrequest to the General Assembly for Palestine\u2019s \nmembership of the United Nations as an independent \nState. While my Government fully supports the idea of \nan independent Palestine, I believe that unilateral \naction will not be helpful. That is why I call on our \nPalestinian friends to support the statement made \nyesterday by the Quartet, in which it drew a clear road \nmap for action to address this fundamental question of \nour time."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for \nme to address the Assembly on behalf of His Majesty \n \n \n7 11-51197 \n \nKing Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom of \nSwaziland. His Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty \nthe Queen Mother, the Government and the people of \nthe Kingdom of Swaziland send best wishes and \ncongratulations to the State of Qatar and Mr. Al-Nasser \non his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are confident \nthat his wide experience and diplomatic skills will \nensure success in the challenging issues that face this \nsession. I should also like to commend the excellent \nwork of his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss. \n The founders of the United Nations envisaged an \ninternational Organization whose primary strength \nwould rest in its Members acting collectively and \ncooperatively in resolving international problems. In \nthis regard, the theme of this general debate, \u201cThe role \nof mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d, pertinently captures the initial vision.  \n The pursuit of peace and security in many parts \nof the world is vital to a future of continued \ncoexistence. We owe it to posterity to maintain a \nhabitable world. International efforts to intervene and \nmediate in internal conflicts should not be taken lightly \nand interlocutors should be alert to the sensibilities \ninvolved in every specific situation. History has taught \nus that transplanted solutions never work successfully. \nThere is no one-size-fits-all in the pursuit of peace \nbecause every situation and era is unique. The \ninternational community should also be quick to spot \nirrelevant forces that seek to champion narrow \ninterests. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to \ncongratulate the Republic of South Sudan on the \nindependence it obtained this year and celebrated on \n9 July. Credit must also go to the Republic of the \nSudan for its steadfast resolve to see to it that the \nprocess was successful. The efforts of the High-Level \nPanel on Darfur and the Panel of the Wise \ncommissioned by the African Union are also \nacknowledged. The African Union has been \ninstrumental in utilizing the vast experience of former \nleaders of Africa as it seeks to identify African \nsolutions for African problems. My country wishes to \nreiterate its commitment to this concept.  \n For a similar reason, the Kingdom of Swaziland \nprays with the people of Libya that there will be a swift \nend to the current conflict and a sustainable solution \nthat has the quest of peaceful resolution as the \nwatchword when dealing with any transitional \ndifficulties. In this regard, we look forward to the \nformation of an all-inclusive Government that will \nensure that Libya moves towards a brighter future. The \nworld needs a unified and stable Libya to resume its \nplace in global affairs. \n It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the \nhugely damaging long-term effects of the war in \nSomalia. The difficulties are now compounded by a \nterrible famine. While the blame might be placed on \nclimate change, nevertheless we hold the view that \nSomalia would manage this latest humanitarian \ndisaster \u2014 the famine \u2014 considerably better if the \ninternational community were to collaborate on a \nsustainable political solution, which is essential for \neconomic recovery. Sadly the world appears to have \nforgotten Somalia, with only the African Union and \nother regional arrangements dealing with the effects of \nthe war in that country.  \n The piracy problem, which has clearly deepened, \nis one of many signs that Somalia needs a \ncomprehensive political intervention that involves all \ninternational interlocutors. There has been a great deal \nof support for the fight against piracy, but not as part of \na more holistic approach. The world surely does not \nwant to send the message that its interventions take \nplace only when specific interests are threatened.  \n In the same spirit, the Kingdom of Swaziland \nencourages the Quartet on the question of Palestine to \nremain resolute in finding common ground between \nIsrael and Palestine. We are well aware that there have \nbeen setbacks before, but we are optimistic that at the \nend of it all there will be a groundbreaking solution, \nwith Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace \nand harmony. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland joins the rest of the \nworld in its condemnation of terrorism and threats to \ninternational peace and security. In the same spirit, we \nrecall the 9/11 criminal attacks that occurred 10 years \nago and all who were affected. We therefore commend \nthe Secretary-General for hosting the Symposium on \nInternational Counter-Terrorism Cooperation, which \nunderscored the importance of greater international \ncooperation among States on a whole range of counter-\nterrorism topics, as covered in the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We hope that the \nrecommendations thereof will provide a source of \n  \n \n11-51197 8 \n \nreference to all Member States, international \norganizations and relevant stakeholders. \n The promotion and protection of human rights are \na common objective of all countries. While great \nachievements have been made in international human \nrights cooperation since the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, challenges still exist. As \na developing country, we believe that greater \nimportance should be attached to the right to \ndevelopment so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of \nglobalization. The international community should pay \nmore attention to economic, social and cultural \nrights \u2014 such as the right to life, the right to food and \nthe right to health \u2014 and promote international \ncooperation in this regard. The developed countries \nshould do more to honour their commitments in terms \nof development assistance, technology transfer, debt \nreduction and market access so as to create favourable \nconditions for the effective promotion of the universal \nrealization of the right to development.  \n The Kingdom of Swaziland voted in favour of \nresolution 60/251, which established the Human Rights \nCouncil. We also formed part of the consensus on \nresolution 65/281 on the review of the Human Rights \nCouncil adopted this year. To this end, we also support \nthe engagement of Member States in the Universal \nPeriodic Review mechanism, which examines the \nhuman rights situation in all countries. Our country \nwill be among those to be considered at the Universal \nPeriodic Review in October 2011, and we look forward \nto engaging in an open and candid dialogue with other \nmembers of the Council. \n Throughout the past session, we pursued many \ndevelopment topics, notably the High-level Meeting on \nHIV/AIDS in June at which our political will to \nintensify our efforts to eliminate the scourge was \nreaffirmed. The Kingdom of Swaziland is proud to \nhave made great strides in this regard. For example, the \npercentage of children born HIV-free to HIV-positive \nmothers enrolled in the prevention of mother-to-child \ntransmission programme has risen to 83 per cent and is \nexpected to reach 100 per cent by 2015.  \n In today\u2019s highly integrated and interconnected \nworld, almost all issues demand the full participation \nof international partners. Taiwan is one of the leading \neconomic and technological powerhouses of the world \ntoday, and the Kingdom of Swaziland is of the view \nthat Taiwan can contribute successfully to the \ninternational community. We therefore urge the United \nNations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan\u2019s \nmeaningful participation in its specialized agencies and \nmechanisms, including the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization and the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. There is no doubt that \nthe there is a functional need to include the people of \nTaiwan in the United Nations system and that their \ninclusion would be in the common interest of the \ninternational community. \n In conclusion, may I say that the Kingdom of Swaziland has confidence in the initiatives already taken towards the renewal of this Organization and looks forward to a new dynamic and vibrant working period.

        "file_text": "Since we last met here, \nmajor changes have swept through the world. We have \nbeen witnessing the Arab Spring. People are standing \nup against authoritarian rule and demanding respect for \nthe fundamental values that underpin this very \ninstitution. Autocrats who have failed to offer the \nprospect of a better life in freedom and dignity have \nbeen overthrown. Now, popular calls for reform in \nSyria have been met with a violent response. We urge \nthe Syrian regime to respect the people\u2019s legitimate \ndemand for democracy and fundamental human rights. \n In July, a new flag rose in Juba as we celebrated \nthe birth of a new State. Last Friday, President Salva \nKiir of South Sudan addressed us from this podium as \nthe leader of our newest Member State (see \n). That became possible thanks, first and \nforemost, to the vision and will of the people and \nleaders of the Sudan and what is now the Republic of \nSouth Sudan. However, it would not have been \npossible without the active support of the international \ncommunity. That demonstrates the importance of \nmediation and the settlement of disputes through \npeaceful means. \n Yet, we know that peace is fragile. The \ninternational community must coordinate its assistance \nand align it with the priorities of the South Sudanese \nGovernment. Outstanding issues must be settled \nthrough negotiations. We must contribute to laying the \nfoundation for two viable States, so that they can both \nlive in peace. \n In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Libya, the United Nations \nhas once again proved its worth by addressing some of \nthe most challenging situations in the world. The \nresolve shown by the Security Council on Libya has \nreconfirmed its pivotal role in global governance and \ninternational security \u2014 the role that Member States \nbestowed on it through the United Nations Charter. \nThere are times when there is no alternative to the use \nof force. When the Security Council acts, it is up to \nus \u2014 the Member States \u2014 to put its decisions into \npractice. Norway\u2019s active participation in the military \ncampaign in Libya was, first and foremost, an \nexpression of our belief in a United Nations-led world \norder and in the principle of the responsibility to \nprotect. \n The response to Libya was also a landmark in \nterms of international justice. For the very first time, a \nunanimous Security Council chose to refer possible \ncrimes against humanity to the International Criminal \nCourt. Combating impunity and promoting the rule of \nlaw and fundamental human rights are key to the \nprevention of conflict and the protection of civilians. \n Promoting and strengthening human rights and \ngender equality are a common responsibility. Failing to \nadhere to universally agreed principles in that area is \nsimply not acceptable. Investment in and \nempowerment of girls and women so that they can \nparticipate fully in the political and economic lives of \nStates are also essential for economic growth and \nprosperity. There is fundamental evidence that States \nthat fail on that account and continue repressive and \ndiscriminating gender policies will remain poor. \n Last year, we reconfirmed our commitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals. We agreed to \naccelerate our efforts. Last week, we received new \nevidence of dramatic and positive breakthroughs in our \nquest to reduce child mortality and maternal deaths. \nStrong political leadership, new partnerships and \n  \n \n11-51681 20 \n \ninnovative ways of working have brought real \nprogress. The Secretary-General\u2019s global initiative \n\u201cEvery Woman and Every Child\u201d has been \ninstrumental in this respect. But further progress must \nnot be taken for granted. Norway will continue to focus \non women\u2019s rights and promoting the role of women in \ndevelopment. We will strongly oppose any efforts to \nreverse progress. We must maintain our resolve to \nimplement the Beijing Platform for Action. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nhave proven to be a formidable tool for improving the \nlives of millions of people. Yet much remains to be \ndone. There are vast untapped resources within many \nof the countries that are struggling to achieve the \nMDGs. Broadening the tax base, making tax collection \nmore effective, halting illegal capital flows and \nfighting corruption are all measures that must be fully \nused in the fight against poverty. Getting that right will \nalso improve the social contract in countries emerging \nfrom poverty or conflict. This is a responsibility that \nlies firmly with individual States.  \n With the climate conference in Durban only two \nmonths away, we must all play our part in making it a \nsuccess. Implementation of the Cancun Agreements is \ncrucial. The Green Climate Fund must be made \noperational. Durban should provide a roadmap that can \nbridge the gap between Kyoto and a new and more \nambitious climate regime that includes all major \nemitters. \n Today, 1.4 billion people lack access to \naffordable and reliable electric power supplies. We \nmust combat climate change while promoting \ndevelopment. The Secretary-General\u2019s call for \nsustainable Energy for All is therefore highly welcome. \nTogether with partner countries, Norway will launch a \nnew energy initiative this autumn. The purpose is to \nboost sustainable energy generation and accelerate \nchange towards energy efficiency. New funding will \npromote incentives for the energy sector in partner \ncountries. Such incentives will in turn attract fresh \ncapital for energy projects. We are determined to \nensure concrete progress in Rio on the access-to-\nenergy agenda. \n Now, 20 years after the United Nations first \nConference on Sustainable Development, the nations of \nthe world must renew the partnership for sustainable \ndevelopment. Civil society and the private sector are \ncrucial in this partnership. Norway is committed to a \nsuccessful outcome of the 2012 United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development. \n Back in 1947, Norway voted in favour of the \nestablishment of two States in the former mandate of \nPalestine in this Assembly. In 1949, we also heeded the \ncall in resolution 181 (II) to give sympathetic \nconsideration to an application by either State for \nadmission to membership in the United Nations. We \nvoted in favour of admitting Israel as a Member State. \nWe based our decision at that time on the declarations \nand explanations provided by the Israeli delegation. \nIsrael had persuasively explained why recognition and \nmembership should not await resolution of the \noutstanding issues regarding borders, refugees, \nJerusalem, and peace with neighbouring countries. \nWhen it admitted Israel as a Member State, this \nAssembly referred to those declarations and \nexplanations. \n Since then, Norwegian policy has been based on \nthe vision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living \nside by side in peace and security. Norway has \nconsistently stood by Israel and its inherent right to \nself-defence in accordance with international law. We \nhave also supported the Palestinian right to statehood \nand the building of the Palestinian Authority. \n One of the main issues before this session of the \nGeneral Assembly is the Palestinian quest for \nrecognition. It is legitimate for the Palestinian people \nto turn to the United Nations under the current \ncircumstances. This is neither incompatible with a \nnegotiation process, nor an expression of unilateralism. \nNorway welcomes the call by the Quartet for \nnegotiations on a comprehensive agreement on the \noutstanding final status issues to be completed within a \nyear. \n However, the situation on the ground is changing \nin several ways. A few days ago, the donor support \ngroup to the Palestinian Authority affirmed the success \nof local institution-building. The performance of \nPalestinian public institutions was scrutinized by the \nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the \nUnited Nations. Their joint conclusion was that the \nPalestinians are fully capable of running a State. \n On Friday President Abbas confirmed his \ncommitment to resolving final status issues through \nnegotiations. He also assured us of the Palestinian \nAuthority\u2019s commitment to complying with the United \n \n \n21 11-51681 \n \nNations Charter, relevant United Nations resolutions, \ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights. \n The main obstacle to full institution-building \nremains the occupation. Measures taken under the \nlatter are changing the shape of the territory in the \nWest Bank and East Jerusalem in ways that undermine \nnegotiations and may soon render the two-State vision \nphysically unattainable. The Security Council, the \nGeneral Assembly and the International Court of \nJustice have all rejected the legality of such unilateral \nchanges. \n Both the Palestinians\u2019 readiness for statehood and \nthe declarations and commitments they have made \nshould be acknowledged. Norway looks forward to \nwelcoming Palestine as a full Member of the United \nNations. \n It is vital that we continue to improve and \nstrengthen the United Nations, so that it can serve us \neffectively in times of change. We, the Member States, \nhave not ensured sufficiently wide-ranging reforms. \nWe have not equipped the United Nations with the \nresources needed to carry out the mandates we adopt. \nWe define noble objectives, only to undercut them in \nthe budgeting process. We continue to ask the United \nNations to do more with less. If that is what we want, \nwe must give the Secretary-General greater flexibility. \n At times, the vision of a United Nations that \ndelivers as one is undermined by our own interference \nand insistence on pet projects, earmarking of funds and \ncross-cutting, awkward and, on occasion, internally \nconflicting financial reporting requirements. \nFragmentation does not begin at the United Nations. It \nis a reflection of the priorities and actions of Member \nStates. \n Before I conclude, let me make one last remark. \nWe deeply regret that this podium has once again been \nabused to promote extreme views and unfounded \nallegations. This serves only to incite conflict rather \nthan to bridge differences. We will not give up the \nauthority of our presence in this Hall, but will rather \nconfront such attitudes from this podium. The purpose \nof the general debate is to draw attention to current \nchallenges, express and share our views and lay the \nbasis for constructive dialogue. \n In a rapidly changing world, the United Nations \nmust be able to adapt to new challenges, new actors \nand new geopolitical realities. As the Secretary-\nGeneral reminded us yesterday, with power comes \nresponsibility. After all, the United Nations is only as \ngood as the results it delivers. We are not judged by our \nwords, but by our actions. "

        "file_text": "First, I \nwould like to extend to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser \nand our brotherly country, Qatar, my sincere \ncongratulations on his election as President of the \n  \n \n11-51390 24 \n \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are \ndeeply confident that he will contribute actively to the \nsuccess of its work. I would also like to express my \ngratitude and appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his \nlaudable and tireless efforts as President at the \npreceding session of the Assembly.  \n I take this opportunity to again congratulate \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment \nto a second term. We are ready and determined to \nprovide all possible support to ensure the success of \nthe plan, to be announced in the coming weeks, \ndetailing his vision of the priorities of the Organization \nover the next five years. \n On behalf of my country, Tunisia, I would like \nalso to welcome the sisterly Republic of South Sudan \nto the United Nations and wish the new State \nprosperity and progress and its leaders great success in \ntheir noble mission. \n Allow me to pay tribute from this rostrum to the \nmemory of the martyrs and youths of Tunisia\u2019s valid \nand peaceful revolution, a revolution for freedom and \ndignity that brought the Arab Spring to the world. This \nhistoric event infused new hope into the conscience of \nhumankind, which yearns for justice and democracy \nand places the highest value on freedom and human \nrights. \n This spontaneous revolution \u2014 which had no real \npolitical or ideological leadership and did not involve \nany foreign intervention \u2014 has indeed succeeded in \nputting an end to one of the most dictatorial regimes in \nour region. The revolution exposed its practices and \nthose of similar regimes, which in their hysterical lust \nfor power blocked all political views, stifled freedom \nof expression and deprived young people of their hope \nfor a better future, self-fulfilment and effective \nparticipation in political, economic and social life. \n What happened in Tunisia is but the natural \noutgrowth of decades of tension and frustration. At the \nsame time, it expressed the aspirations of its people to \nlive in dignity and freedom. It was a decisive turning \npoint in the country\u2019s history that enabled us to regain \nour natural place in the community of nations and \npowers. It exemplified the strength of the common \nhuman values of freedom, democracy, tolerance, equal \nopportunities and respect for human rights, in all of \ntheir aspects. \n Today, having removed all obstacles to its \npolitical, economic, social and cultural progress, \nTunisia is at a turning point in its history and is on the \nthreshold of a new stage. It yearns for the \nestablishment of a genuine democracy, founded on \nstrong guarantees that uphold the people\u2019s sovereignty \nand enable them to exercise their rights and determine \ntheir destiny in a political system that is truly \npluralistic and that enjoys peaceful transition of power, \nin accordance with the objectives of the glorious \nrevolution and the faithful memories of our brave \nmartyrs. \n In seeking to achieve the goals of the revolution, \nthe provisional Tunisian Government has made every \neffort to preserve all mechanisms needed to restore \nstability and security in the country, ensure the \ncontinuity of the State and its institutions and protect \nthe interests of all segments of society.  \n We have therefore created the Higher Authority \nfor the Protection of the Revolution, Political Reform \nand Democratic Transition. It brings together a range \nof political views and orientations, as well as \nrepresentatives of civil society and national \norganizations. It has been entrusted with drawing up a \nroad map to ensure a successful transitional period in a \nconsensus-based and harmonious atmosphere. \n The work of the Higher Authority, along with the \nconsultations it held with the various national parties, \nresulted in a balanced and integrated plan of action \nfrom the legal and practical perspectives. This strategy \nwill map out Tunisia\u2019s political future in accordance \nwith the aspirations of its people for a democratic, \npeaceful and quiet transition. \n The main features of this strategy were evidenced \nin the interim President\u2019s decision to suspend the \nTunisian Constitution, dissolve the two chambers of \nParliament and establish a provisional public \nadministration comprised of an interim President and a \nprovisional Government. This Government, whose \ncompetence and integrity are well known, will be \nresponsible for running national affairs until a national \nconstituent assembly is elected. The latter will draft a \nnew constitution and establish a legal framework for \nthe upcoming transitional period and thereby gain \ncredibility in the eyes of the people. \n Important strides have thus been made in \npreparations for the national constituent assembly \nelections, to be held on 23 October. We will spare no \n \n \n25 11-51390 \n \neffort to enable the Tunisian people to elect their \nrepresentatives in a popular, free, pluralistic, \ntransparent and fair fashion. \n We have established an independent higher \nnational authority to monitor the various stages of the \nelectoral process and have endowed it with the \nnecessary legal foundations and financial support so \nthat it can fulfil its mission independently and \neffectively under the best possible conditions. This \nhighlights the fairness of our national approach and the \nclear vision of the political actors involved. \n In that respect, it is worth recalling that for the \nfirst time in its history, Tunisia has adopted by \nconsensus the principle of mandatory parity in its voter \nregistries. That will enable us to maximize the potential \nof Tunisian society, men and women alike, and to \npreserve the well-deserved position held so \ncompetently by women in the fabric of Tunisian \nsociety. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs \nof the Netherlands, made a comment in that regard a \nfew minutes ago.  \n In parallel with the progress made in the political \nfield, the provisional Government is pursuing its \ncomprehensive reforms in all sectors and fields. \nUpholding human rights and protecting public \nfreedoms are the Government\u2019s highest priorities. \n Tunisia believes deeply in the universal values of \nsolidarity, justice and international cooperation. In that \nrespect, we urgently appeal to the entire international \ncommunity, including Governments, international and \nregional organizations and civil society activists, to \nlend their support to our country\u2019s efforts to repatriate \nthe assets stolen from the Tunisian people by the \nformer President and all of his family members and in-\nlaws. The Tunisian people have the right to those funds \nand are in urgent need of them during this critical \nperiod fraught with tremendous economic and social \nchallenges. \n Tunisia also calls on all States that have received \nrequests for extradition of persons involved in those \ncrimes to respond positively to those legitimate \nrequests. That will allow Tunisian justice to hold \naccountable all those who committed crimes against \nthe Tunisian people, within the framework of a fair \ntrial that guarantees the rights of the defendant under \nTunisian law and international instruments. \n We thank the friendly, kindred countries that have \nresponded favourably to those requests. We hope that \nall States will efficiently and swiftly respond to \nTunisia\u2019s requests, pursuant to the noble principles of \ninternational cooperation and solidarity and to ensure \nthat the values of justice, equality and fairness before \nthe law will be respected by all. \n The Government of Tunisia, with the support of \nnational and international economic actors, has \nresponded to the challenges generated by the delicate \npost-revolutionary situation, including its negative \neffects on our national economy. Humanitarian and \neconomic conditions related to the crisis in sisterly \nLibya have further complicated the situation and \nhampered our Government\u2019s task. Creating jobs, \nreducing the unemployment rate and eliminating social \nand economic disparities have become major \nchallenges of the country. \n Tunisia has been endowed with many national \nassets that will enable us to achieve our goals. We face \nnumerous challenges in our endeavours for a \ndemocratic transition and for economic and social \ndevelopment, including the economic recession, which \nis apparent in certain areas. Therefore our country \nremains in need of continuous support and assistance \nfrom the international community. \n I would like to seize this opportunity to convey \nmy special thanks to the Group of Eight and the \ninternational and regional financial institutions that did \nnot hesitate to support Tunisia\u2019s democratic transition \nand economic revival processes, especially within the \nframework of the Deauville Partnership. I would also \nlike to thank United Nations bodies, regional groups \nand friendly and sisterly countries for their precious \ncontributions, whether in assisting the successful \ndemocratic transition or reducing the impact of the \neconomic crisis in Tunisia and its social repercussions.  \n I also welcome the seminal efforts of States and \norganizations alike for their assistance in responding to \nthe massive influx of hundreds of thousands refugees \ninto Tunisia following the events that occurred in \nkindred Libya. Tunisia\u2019s deep integration into its \nregional and international surroundings is a top priority \nfor our foreign policy, which we are keen to develop \nthrough good relations with all States and \norganizations, based on cooperation, mutual respect, \ngood-neighbourliness and respect for common \ninterests. \n  \n \n11-51390 26 \n \n Tunisia considers relations with its immediate \nneighbours \u2014 the countries of the Arab Maghreb \nUnion \u2014 especially important. We reiterate our call for \nresumed coordination among all of the Union\u2019s \nmember States to initiate a new phase of promoting \nintegration through the establishment of durable and \njoint institutions, mainly in development and the \neconomy, for the benefit of all of the peoples of our \nregion. \n In speaking of our Maghreb region, I take the \nopportunity to pay tribute also to the kindred Libyan \npeople and to reiterate the warm respect and \ncongratulations of the Tunisian people for their \nvictorious revolution. It represents a crucial, historic \nchange in the region that will pave the way for the \nemergence of a democratic political system in Libya. \nThose developments will have a profound, positive \nimpact on Tunisian-Libyan relations and on the \nestablishment of the Arab Maghreb Union. \n As an Arab, Islamic and African country, Tunisia \nremains proud and deeply attached to its various \norigins. It will continue to support the political and \nregional organizations and groupings of which it is a \nmember, as well as its economic and development \npartnerships. \n Tunisia will remain faithful to mutual action \nwithin the Arab forum and to supporting the issues of \nconcern to the League of Arab States, including the \ncause of Palestine.  \n Tunisia reaffirms its unwavering and principled \nposition in support for its Palestinian brothers and \nsisters and for their request for full recognition as a \nState Member of the United Nations, as expressed by \nthe President of the Palestinian Authority, \nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, before the Assembly this past \nFriday (see ). Tunisia thus calls on the \ninternational community to support the legitimate \nPalestinian bid for full membership in the United \nNations, as well as its territorial integrity as an \nindependent State within legally recognized borders, \nwith the Holy City of Jerusalem as its capital. At the \nsame time, Tunisia strongly condemns the unjust \nembargo imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip and its \nrecent military aggression there, which resulted in \nmany innocent victims.  \n While congratulating the kindred Egyptian people \nfor their young peoples\u2019 successful revolution based on \ntheir legitimate aspirations for freedom and dignity, \nTunisia expresses its hope that peace and stability will \nbe restored in Syria and Yemen in order to meet the \naspirations of their peoples for democracy, freedom \nand reforms. In parallel, Tunisia reaffirms its rejection \nof any attempt to exploit the situation in those two \nfriendly countries. Tunisia reiterates its call to end the \nIsraeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the \nremaining occupied Lebanese territories, in accordance \nwith international law. \n As an African country, Tunisia attaches particular \nimportance to its geographic position in the continent \nand to its belief in the importance of geographic \nintegration and strengthened cooperation and solidarity \nwith the sisterly African countries. Tunisia remains \nfaithful to enhancing this belief while reaffirming \nrespect for the principles and objectives of the African \nUnion and its unwavering support for all initiatives \naimed at promoting development in the continent and \npreserving its peace and stability and its capabilities. \n Given the strategic importance of its relations \nwith the European Union, Tunisia will further enhance \nthose relations with an eye to establishing a closely \nknit partnership based on mutual respect and common \ninterests. Here, Tunisia expresses its hope that the \nEuropean Union and all of the friendly European \ncountries will be among the first to support the \nTunisian people and to assist them in the successful \nimplementation of their transitional phase in the \npolitical, financial and economical sectors.  \n Tunisia will also strengthen cooperation in its \nrelations with the countries and the peoples of the \nMediterranean under the Union for the Mediterranean.  \n Our country attaches a particular importance also \nto fostering its relations with Australia, Latin American \nand the Asian countries, as well as with their major \nregional groups, within the framework of an open and \nbalanced foreign policy approach aimed at establishing \na multifaceted partnership. \n Tunisia will strive to re-establish its position \nwithin the United Nations in a way that reflects its \npeoples\u2019 awareness and aspirations as well as its rich \nhistory and positive contributions in its international \nrelations. In that context, we highlight our commitment \nto the principles of international law and international \nlegitimacy and call for launching the process of \nreforming the United Nations, mainly through \nenlargement of the Security Council\u2019s membership in \n \n \n27 11-51390 \n \norder to ensure permanent representation of the African \ncontinent. \n Tunisia\u2019s provisional Government welcomed the \nconvening by the General Assembly, in July 2011, of \nthe High-level Meeting on Youth and its outcome \ndocument (resolution 65/312), which contains \nimportant recommendations reflecting the aspirations \nof young people throughout the world and based on the \nawareness that unemployment had become a universal \nphenomenon and thus one of the major challenges. We \nreiterate our call to all concerned parties to develop a \nglobal strategy to fight unemployment. \n While organizing the elections to the National \nConstituent Assembly next October is a priority for our \ncountry, we reiterate our adherence to regional and \ninternational commitments and responsibilities. We \nreaffirm our work, as a peace-loving country, for \ninternational legality and to uphold the principles and \nvalues of the United Nations. We are determined to \nplay an active and vital role in international relations, \nin line with the aspirations of our people, who have \nconducted a peaceful revolution to recover their rights, \nfreedom and dignity."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate \nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsixth session. Allow me also to commend his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his \ncapable leadership during the sixty-fifth session. \n I would like to begin my statement by thanking \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his historic visit to \nKiribati and Solomon Islands earlier this month. That \nwas the first time that a sitting Secretary-General \nvisited a Pacific island country, and it demonstrates his \ncommitment to addressing the needs of all countries, \nno matter how small or remote. From my conversations \nwith the Secretary-General, I know he left the region \nwith a much clearer understanding of the special \nchallenges we face as small island nations. I look \nforward to working with the Secretary-General on \nfinding ways for the United Nations system to be more \nresponsive to the unique and particular needs of small \nisland developing States (SIDS). \n While on his tour of the Pacific, the Secretary-\nGeneral observed that  \n \u201cNext month, the 7 billionth citizen of our world \nwill be born. For that child, and for all of us, we \nmust keep working to fight poverty, create decent \njobs and provide a dignified life while preserving \nthe planet that sustains us. That is why I have \nsaid that the sustainable development agenda is \nthe agenda for the twenty-first century\u201d. (see \nSG/SM/13780) \n Sustainable development and poverty alleviation \nhave been the overriding priorities of my presidency \nsince I assumed office, in 2007. We have made great \nstrides domestically, but we will still fall short of our \nambitious goals until the international community \nchooses to create an environment in which all countries \nhave the opportunity to realize their sustainable \ndevelopment aspirations. \n Nauru\u2019s culture and economy, like those of most \nPacific SIDS, are heavily dependent on a healthy and \nproductive marine environment. The ocean is the \nfoundation of our food security and is a major source \nof Government revenue. It is for that reason that the \nPacific SIDS are calling for the next Earth Summit in \nRio to recognize the importance of the \u201cblue economy\u201d \nto small island and coastal States. I would like to thank \nMaldives, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the \nSecretary-General, for standing with the Pacific SIDS \non this issue. \n We have identified three priority areas for the \nRio+20 outcome. First, we must enable SIDS to enjoy \na greater share of the economic benefits derived from \ntheir marine and coastal resources. Secondly, we must \nreduce, and eventually eliminate, overfishing and \ndestructive fishing practices. It is imperative that we \nensure that our fisheries are sustainable. Finally, we \nmust build up the resilience of coral reef ecosystems to \nthe impacts of climate change and ocean acidification. \nAdopting our proposals would begin to create the space \nneeded for small islands to thrive.  \n My Government is not sitting still while it waits \nfor the international community to act. This past \nsummer, Nauru\u2019s application to the International \nSeabed Authority was granted, which will enable my \ncountry to engage in new and innovative ways to \ngenerate economic growth and move towards aid \nindependence. Nauru is not endowed with terrestrial \nresources, and therefore has chosen to look to the \noceans to expand its opportunities for economic and \nsocial development.  \n The proceeds from our exploration and \ndevelopment of copper, nickel and manganese \nresources will go to two fully Nauruan-owned funds, \none that supports education and training, and the other, \nhealth and environment. This Nauru-controlled, \ndomestically driven initiative will adhere to the highest \ninternational environmental standards. \n \n \n15 11-51191 \n \n The sustainable development challenges of SIDS \nare widely recognized by the international community; \nhowever, our success in addressing them has been \nmixed at best. At last year\u2019s High-level Plenary \nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals, it was \ndetermined that progress for most Pacific islands had \nbeen lagging in many areas. Targeted assistance to \naddress the unique and particular vulnerabilities of \nSIDS is urgently needed. It is Nauru\u2019s position that the \nmost effective way to accomplish this objective is for \nthe United Nations to recognize a formal SIDS \ncategory, with dedicated support mechanisms. \n Unfortunately, all of our best efforts will have \nbeen for naught if we do not take immediate action to \naddress climate change. As Pacific island leaders \nrecognized earlier this month, climate change \nrepresents the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, \nsecurity and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. \n The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, to be held in Durban, must make significant \nprogress towards a comprehensive, legally binding \nagreement that can ensure the survival of all nations. \nThe parties must agree to a second commitment period \nunder the Kyoto Protocol, so that new commitments \nare in place by 2013. The parties must also \noperationalize the agreements reached at Canc\u00fan, \nincluding more ambitious mitigation commitments and \nactions, the operationalization of the new Green \nClimate Fund, and a mandate to conclude a new legally \nbinding agreement based on the work of the Ad Hoc \nWorking Group on Long-term Cooperative Action. \n Climate change threatens to undo all of our recent \ndevelopment gains if the major biggest polluters \ncontinue down the path of business as usual. Some \nPacific islands may disappear entirely. It is an \nunfortunate reality that there is so much carbon in the \natmosphere that many of the negative impacts of \nclimate change may now be unavoidable. For that \nreason, Nauru applauds the recent open debate in the \nSecurity Council on climate change. While the final \npresidential statement was not as strong as we had \nhoped, it clearly recognizes the threat posed by climate \nchange to international peace and security and lays the \nfoundation for future work by the Council on the issue.  \n Few countries doubt the connection between \nclimate change and security, but there is still \ndisagreement as to the way forward. Allow me to \nreiterate the proposals of the Pacific SIDS. \n First, the Secretary-General should appoint a \nspecial representative on climate and security to \nanalyse the projected security impacts of climate \nchange, so that the Council and Member States can \nbetter understand what lies ahead. Secondly, the \nSecretary-General should assess the capacity of the \nUnited Nations system to respond to the likely security \nimpacts of climate change, so that vulnerable countries \ncan be assured that it is up to the task. These two \nproposals represent the absolute minimum necessary to \nprepare for the greatest threat to international peace \nand security of our generation. \n The Security Council must grapple with the most \nurgent security threats of our time if it is to remain \nrelevant. Likewise, it should evolve along with \nemerging geopolitical realities and become more \nrepresentative and inclusive. It is for this reason that \nNauru supports an early reform of the Security Council \nthrough an enlargement of both the permanent and \nnon-permanent categories and an improvement in its \nworking methods. \n We believe very strongly that new members \nshould be geographically diverse. However, it is \nequally important that aspiring members demonstrate \ntheir commitment to addressing the most urgent \nsecurity issues facing all Member States. As an \nexample, I would like to highlight Germany\u2019s bold \nleadership of the Security Council this past July, when \nit took the politically courageous decision to host the \nopen debate on climate change. As I said earlier, \nclimate change is the overriding security threat facing \nthe Pacific region, and Germany\u2019s efforts will not be \nforgotten. \n In a similar vein, the United Nations should \nensure that all citizens of the world have the \nopportunity to participate in its activities. We cannot \ncontinue to ignore the more than 23 million people \nwho live in Taiwan, who have repeatedly demonstrated \nthat they are a nation committed to peace and regional \ncooperation. We therefore support enabling Taiwan\u2019s \nmeaningful engagement in connection with the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nand the International Civil Aviation Organization. \n The recent renaming of the Group of Asian \nStates, to the Group of Asia and the Pacific Small \nIsland Developing States, is a welcome change that \n  \n \n11-51191 16 \n \nexemplifies the inclusivity that should characterize all \naspects of the United Nations system. I commend the \nGroup for having taken this symbolic step and \nrecognizing the 20 per cent of the membership that \nresides in the Pacific Ocean region. \n However, we must move beyond symbolism to \nconcrete action that addresses the actual concerns of \nsmall and vulnerable countries. Once again, I implore \nthe Assembly to support the appointment of a special \nrepresentative on climate and security for the benefit of \nthe many nations around the world for whom climate \nchange is a grave and, in some cases, existential threat. \n My Government is preparing for a new challenge. \nIn 2012, Nauru will assume the chairmanship of the \nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). I would like \nto recognize the Government of Grenada for its \ninspirational leadership and able execution of a \nsupremely difficult task. \n I am humbled by the trust placed in us by our \nfellow AOSIS colleagues and have no illusions \nregarding the enormity of the challenges that lie ahead. \nWe are entering a period in history when countries are \nturning inward, despite decades of evidence that \ncooperation is the surest path to prosperity. We must \nresist the urge to engage in zero-sum politics and \nrecommit to the principles of multilateralism enshrined \nin the United Nations Charter. Durban will be the next \nopportunity to embark on a more sustainable path and \ncreate a world we are proud to leave for future \ngenerations. We should not let this opportunity slip \naway. \n For years, leaders in the Pacific have implored \nthe peoples of the world to come to our islands and see \nthe impacts of climate change for themselves. The \nSecretary-General answered our call, and now he truly \nunderstands the urgency of our situation. \n Earlier this week, he spoke of a little girl named \nTamauri he met while in Kiribati (see ). \nFrightened by the rising tides around her islands, she \nasked what the United Nations could do to help her \npeople. She is not alone. The children in all of our \ncountries \u2014 Cook Islands, Fiji, Micronesia, Palau, \nPapua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Niue, Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own, \nNauru \u2014 wonder whether they will have a future. I \nlook forward to working with the Secretary-General to \nmeet the challenge of the climate crisis so that we can \ntell them that they no longer need to be afraid. May \nGod bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless \nthe United Nations."

        "file_text": "My country is most happy to \nwelcome South Sudan as a member of the United \nNations family. I now seek the permission of the \nMembers to speak on the subject of happiness. \n Since joining the United Nations 41 years ago, \nBhutan has always maintained a long-term and broad \nperspective on the purpose of this great Organization, \nwhich is to create a secure and harmonious society. But \nin the many times that I have participated in the United \nNations General Assembly over the last 25 years, I \ncannot recall a session that gave me reason for hope for \nthe future of humanity, except once. That was when the \ncold war came to a thundering halt, and a euphoric \nworld saw it as the dawn of a new era. I was then a \nyoung ambassador excited by the prospects of peace \ndividends. Instead, what followed was a sense of \nbetrayal and disillusionment, as the world became ever \nmore divided and insecure. \n We gather before this high podium, year after \nyear, and make of this annual gathering a mournful \nevent. We speak of what ought to be, of promises \nbroken and opportunities lost. We speak of endless \nconflicts within and among nations, of the failures of \nGovernments, of frequent and devastating disasters, of \ndiminishing resources and fierce competition for their \ncontrol, of dying ecosystems and new threatening \ndiseases and epidemics, and of financial calamities and \neconomic ruin. We speak of rising unemployment, \nhopeless poverty, hunger and destitution. And of \ncourse, we talk of solutions. \n Lacking the political will and, indeed, clarity of \nvision, we deny with clever arguments what we know \nto be the cause of our predicaments. So we go on doing \n \n \n35 11-51185 \n \nwhat is irrational. We continue to acquire arms to \nprevent war; answer climate change with more harmful \nemissions; race to extract, produce and consume more \nin the face of depleting resources; fuel faltering \neconomies with debt and greed; and enable the wealthy \nto widen the deep crevasses that separate the rich from \nthe poor. We idealize individualism as family and \ncommunity crumble amid rising social dislocation, \ncrime, mental illness, loneliness and suicide. \n For too long, we have ignored the truth that the \ncauses of all those problems are interrelated and that \ndurable remedies must be found through a rational and \nholistic approach. For too long, we have refused to \naccept that economic models focused on gross \ndomestic product have served their useful purpose and \nthat we need to switch tracks. Guided by the misbelief \nthat life satisfaction is about material pursuit and \naccumulation and that good economics is about \nlimitless growth, our economic development processes \nhave created the monster of a consumerist market \neconomy. \n However, the market gives no satisfaction. It \nenslaves humanity and thrives on the insatiable nature \nof our greed. As slaves, our value as individuals and \nnations is measured by the extent of our economic \nproductivity and consumption capacity. That sad \ntransformation, from humans into voracious beasts, \ncomes at the cost of our physical, psychological and \nspiritual well-being. It is destroying our natural life-\nsupport systems and threatening our long-term \nsurvival. But that need not be so. \n Humankind is in need of a clear vision that \ntranscends the diversity of our cultures, thoughts and \ncircumstances and binds us to a common pursuit. We \nneed a different development paradigm that is guided \nby a vision that is holistic, sustainable, inclusive and \nhumane. Such a vision can take civilization forward \nand enable it to sustain the progress that it has created \nand must continue to make. \n It is therefore with a great sense of joy that my \ncountry welcomed resolution 65/309, entitled \n\u201cHappiness: towards a holistic approach to \ndevelopment\u201d. Introduced by Bhutan and sponsored by \n68 Member States, it was adopted unanimously without \na vote in July. Through that resolution, Member States \nadopted a universal goal, while acknowledging the \nlimitations of our conventional development processes. \nIt commits our nations to creating the necessary \npolitical, social and economic conditions to enable the \npursuit of happiness by citizens within a stable \nenvironment. \n My delegation is of the firm conviction that \nhappiness or well-being, as it is promoted in my \ncountry, would be against a well-developed set of \nindices, a natural progression from the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, which aim to establish the \nminimum conditions for human survival and the basis \nfor development. It is, indeed, a universal value that \nbinds the rich and the poor, and the developed and the \ndeveloping, and articulates the ultimate purpose of life. \nIt is about making true societal progress in ways that \nare meaningful, joyful and lasting. \n In that regard, I am happy to report that my \nGovernment, in collaboration with the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the Earth Institute of \nColumbia University and leading scientists and \nthinkers on the science and economics of happiness, \nare working in concert to prepare the panel discussion \nstipulated by the resolution. Proposed to be held in \nNew York in the spring of 2012 before the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, the \nmeeting will endeavour to present to Member States a \nset of policy recommendations in their pursuit of \nhappiness as they work in harmonious collaboration \nwith each other with a shared and clear sense of \npurpose. We look forward to Members\u2019 participation in \nthat meeting. \n My delegation remains fully committed to the \npromotion of a sustainable and progressive human \ncivilization within a peaceful and secure environment. \nTo that happy end, Bhutan is prepared to share its \nexperience and the modest development achievements \nmade with the support of our generous partners. Our \nattempts to promote equitable and sustainable social \neconomic growth are bearing fruit within a rich \nbiodiversity that includes a forest cover that has \nexpanded from 64 per cent to 81 per cent in four \ndecades. Today, Bhutan is the only country that has \npledged to remain carbon neutral forever. Our social \nand cultural values remain vital, even as we embrace \nglobalization and its many offerings. We have \nsuccessfully and smoothly transited from an absolute \nmonarchy to a fully fledged and vibrant democracy. \n For those reasons and out of a sense of duty and \nobligation, my country aspires to serve as a non-permanent \nmember on the Security Council for the biennium \n  \n \n11-51185 36 \n \n2013-2014. Having been a member of the United \nNations for 41 years and never having served on the \nCouncil, while having fully enjoyed the benefits of \nmembership, we wish to contribute as a small State for \nsmall States. We believe that we can bring to the \nSecurity Council a fresh and holistic perspective on \npeace and security beyond its narrow confines and \nopen it to new and innovative approaches to fulfilling \nits important mandate. My country is of the firm belief \nthat maintaining peace and security is not only about \npreventing war. It is about recognizing and forging the \nwill to deal with all forms of threat to the survival, \nprogress and happiness of human society. \n Yes, I speak of a dream, but it is possible. As \nleaders and representatives of our peoples, we must \ndare to dream and find the courage and determination \nto pursue the highest of ideals. That is how happiness \nis to be fashioned. Blessings and good luck! \n My country prays for Members\u2019 support to give \nBhutan an opportunity to contribute to the realization \nof shared dreams. I wish participants happiness."

        "file_text": "After \nthree years of political crisis and a three-year absence, \nMadagascar is proud today to resume its place here in \nthe community of nations. On behalf of my fellow \ncountrymen, I am particularly honoured to participate \nin this general debate under the theme \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlements of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d. \n The successive crises around the world, most \nrecently in North Africa, demonstrate the importance \nand relevance of that theme. Madagascar has been \nthrough one itself, and it has just taken a major step \nforward thanks to the help of international mediation, \nwhich has allowed the Malagasy to reach a promising \nconsensus.  \n I also wish to pay a sincere tribute to the late Dag \nHammarskj\u00f6ld, the former Secretary-General of this \ngreat Organization, a pioneer of preventive diplomacy \nand an architect of the concept of peacekeeping, as we \nmark the fiftieth anniversary of his tragic passing. \nDuring his tenure, he worked tirelessly to solidify the \nlegitimacy of the United Nations in the peaceful \nresolution of international disputes. Now again, we \nowe him a great debt for the universal recognition of \nthe virtues of mediation in resolving tensions and even \nconflicts. \n We have just commemorated the tragic events of \n11 September 2001, which shook the city of New York \nand indeed the whole world. It is also 10 years since \nthe United Nations Year of Dialogue among \nCivilizations, during which the dialogue of cultures \nand the culture of dialogue were promoted on the \ninternational stage in order to combat the clash of \ncivilizations. \n When we speak of conflicts, we have in mind two \ndifferent ideologies that do not uphold the same values. \nThat can mean two countries, two regions or even a \nGovernment and its people. In the last case, when one \nno longer respects the other it triggers a popular \nuprising that ends in a conflict, leading to a crisis; \nhence, the importance of the role of mediation in \nsettling disputes through peaceful means. \n  \n \n11-51191 32 \n \n In that regard, any mediation should collate first-\nhand information. It should see for itself the realities \nprevailing on the ground in a conflict before proposing \na solution that would be lasting and acceptable to all. \n History has shown that the excessive acts of a \nleader who resorts to force have serious repercussions \nfor his country that can lead it into chaos and cost the \nlives of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of \ninnocent people. It is an entire people who, \nunfortunately, suffer the grave consequences. This \noccurs because true solutions are often too slow in \ncoming, plunging a large segment of humankind into \npoverty, since we must respond to suffering, anguish \nand despair. We want to change and we will change. \n To better illustrate my words, allow me to speak \nof the case of my country, Madagascar. Everyone here \nknows as well as I do that the island of Madagascar has \nbeen in political crisis since late 2008. The Malagasy \npeople rose up with determination to break with a past \nmarked by poor governance and non-respect for \ndemocratic principles, human rights and the rule of law \nthat gave rise to widespread impoverishment, \nunbearable and inescapable social poverty, and the \ngrowing frustration of the majority of my countrymen. \nThe Malagasy people therefore demanded a better life \nand genuine change, with strengthened respect for \nuniversal principles. \n When the search for a solution to the crisis turned \nto the principle of consensual and inclusive \nmanagement of transition, and when that consensus \nproved difficult to reach, commendable mediation \nefforts among the Malagasy protagonists were made by \nlocal civil society organizations, the bilateral and \nregional partners of the big island, and the international \ncommunity. \n I permit myself to mention here and to strongly \ncommend the untiring and patient efforts of the \nmediation team of the Southern African Development \nCommunity (SADC), a regional body mandated by the \nAfrican Union, as well as the determined initiatives of \nother entities, such as the United Nations, the \nInternational Organization of la Francophonie and the \nIndian Ocean Commission. The involvement of these \nand all actors concerned in the mediation was critical \nin responding with effectiveness and pragmatism \ncommensurate with the emergency and in meeting the \nvital needs of the Malagasy people and economy, \nwhich could and would have been weakened if the \ncrisis and the negotiations had lasted any longer. \n The Malagasy people were patient and showed \nunprecedented and exemplary courage in the peaceful \nsettlement of the political crisis, despite all the \neconomic and social restrictions, as well as the absence \nof international aid that it has suffered for the past \nthree years. The post-crisis road map for Madagascar, \nproposed by SADC mediation, was initialled on \n9 March and signed by the political factions \nrepresenting the vast majority of Malagasy \nstakeholders on 17 September. The great political \nMalagasy family is now determined to move forward \nand to work together in the overall interest of the \nnation for the well-being, peace and serenity of the \nentire people. \n An extremely important threshold has just been \ncrossed, but there is still much work to be done. Now, \nwe must focus primarily on the implementation of the \nprovisions of the road map, with full respect for the \npeople\u2019s primary aspirations, leading towards the \nholding of free, credible, fair and transparent elections. \nThat, in my opinion, is the only definitive solution to \nthe crisis ensuring a return to constitutional normality.  \n We have finally managed to reach a consensus \nagreement, reflected in the sense of compromise of \nwhich we are particularly proud, based as it is in the \ninherent culture of Fihavanana \u2014 a notion of social \nlife that has guided the Malagasy people since the \ndawn of time and that can be boiled down to the \nprinciples of fraternity, solidarity, mutual respect, \ntolerance and wisdom. We have thereby expressed our \nresolve to move forward towards the reconstruction \nand development of our society. \n For my part, I will spare no effort and will do my \nutmost to ensure that these actions achieve the \nanticipated results and are rapidly crowned with \nsuccess. I therefore launch a solemn appeal to the \ninternational community to make the needed individual \nand collective contribution to their implementation. In \nparticular, I draw the attention of the United Nations to \nthe work that it must undertake in assessing \nMadagascar\u2019s electoral needs so that an electoral \ntimeframe, drawn up in a credible, neutral, transparent \nand independent way and based on respect for \nfundamental rights and international standards, can be \nestablished as soon as possible. \n History teaches us that, even following the use of \nforce, all wars and conflicts always end around a table. \nThat clearly shows that mediation can be chosen as an \nalternative to weapons. We are opposed to the use of \nany form of repression whatsoever. It is entirely \n \n \n33 11-51191 \n \npossible to resolve differences by peaceful means, as in \nthe case for Madagascar, by resorting to a more \neffective method, such as dialogue. \n The world is evolving. The world is changing, \nand all of us leaders here want a better world for our \nrespective peoples. Yes, it is possible, and we can do it. "

        "file_text": "I would first of all like to \ncongratulate Ambassador Al-Nasser on assuming the \npresidency of the General Assembly.  \n The twentieth anniversary this year of the \nrestoration of Estonia\u2019s independence, not surprisingly, \ncoincides with our twentieth year of membership in the \nUnited Nations and our participation in the General \nAssembly. Given where we were then, in 1991 \u2014 a \npoor and beleaguered country, brutalized by a half-\ncentury of thuggish Soviet, then Nazi, and then again \nSoviet occupation \u2014 our transformation in one \ngeneration to a modern, technologically cutting-edge \nEuropean democracy is a testament to what a \ncommitted people can do. It is, as well, a challenge to \nthose who find excuses for not implementing \n \n \n47 11-50692 \n \ndemocracy, for not eliminating corruption and for \ncontinuing to brutalize their citizens. \n Today, 20 years after the bumbling coup and \nensuing crumbling of that rusty edifice of \ntotalitarianism, the Soviet Union, we again smell in the \nair the hope of liberty and democracy \u2014 this time in \nthe Middle East and North Africa. Again people have \ncome together and said, \u201cEnough!\u201d \u2014 of the lies, the \ncorruption and the 3 a.m. knock on the door by the \ndull-brained goons of the secret police. People want to \nbe able to speak their minds and to run their own lives, \nfree of harassment, or worse, by the authorities. In a \nword, people want democracy. They want, too, the \nfoundations of democracy: respect for human rights, \nthe rule of law and the freedom of speech and \nassembly. \n With those hopes in the hearts of so many people \nin this year of otherwise dismal and tawdry news, \nEstonia welcomes \u2014 indeed wholeheartedly \nencourages \u2014 the United Nations to move forward on \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s decision to focus \nduring his second term on democracy and human \nrights. Estonia welcomes that decision because, \nfrankly, the results of the democracy movements of a \ngeneration ago have not even come close to what we \nhoped for at the time. Most of the people who lived \nunder undemocratic rule two decades ago continue to \ndo so today. Of what was the Soviet Union then, only \nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania have earned the \ndesignation \u201cfree\u201d in Freedom House\u2019s annual report \ncard on the rule of law, respect for fundamental \nfreedoms and free and fair elections. That, I submit, is \na poor result. \n Each country and each situation is of course \ndifferent. No textbook rules can tell us how to make \ndemocracy work or how to build a prosperous society. \nA few basic tenets and lessons, however, hold across \nnations, experiences and cultures. The United Nations \nown Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2014 a \ndocument everyone here is obliged to adhere to \u2014 \nafter all, is based on the premise of common truths held \nby all. \n Democracy, as I said, is not only about voting and \nfree and fair elections, vital though they are for any \nfree and democratic society. Respect for human rights \nand the rule of law constitute the cornerstones of an \nopen society. If one cannot speak their mind or be \nguaranteed a fair trial if arrested, it matters little that \nthey can go to the polling booth. Rights and freedoms \nbelong to each and every person. They are not the \nprivilege of a select few with the money, the guns or \nthe power. \n For Estonia, it is of fundamental importance that \nthe North African and Middle Eastern revolutions have \nbeen popular reactions to sustained violations of \nhuman rights, corruption and injustice. The revolutions \nconfirm the universal aspiration to realize one\u2019s human \nrights. They show once again, as throughout history, \nthat people naturally want to be free from fear and \nrepression. Notice I said people, not \u201cmen\u201d. As long \nago as 2,500 years ago, Aristotle noted that where \u201cthe \nstate of women is bad, almost half of human life is \nspoilt\u201d. This is no less true today and will remain so. \nThe ongoing revolutions could not have occurred and \ncannot succeed without women.  \n It is a profound source of concern to Estonia to \nnotice that, while women are welcome to protest \nagainst corrupt regimes, they are not always welcome \nto participate in the political process. Estonia therefore \nplaces great hopes on the United Nations new gender \nentity, UN-Women, and will continue to insist that the \nUnited Nations as a whole do its part globally by \nstanding up for women\u2019s rights. We also expect that \nUN-Women will play an active role in helping to take \nthe principles of Security Council resolution 1325 \n(2000) on women and peace and security from paper to \nreality. \n For as long as we have lived as a free nation, \nEstonia has always protected and promoted human \nrights and fundamental freedoms at home and abroad. \nOur candidature to the Human Rights Council is a \nlogical consequence of our work, but it is certainly not \nthe culmination as we continue to live up to our \nnational and international obligations. \n Once again, ongoing events underline the need \nfor us to focus on the protection of civilians from \natrocities. Even in the democratic part of my continent, \nthe political project we today call the European Union \nwas a reaction to mass murder and war. The very \nhistory of Europe motivates us to take preventive steps \nto avoid any repetition of such crimes. Therefore, it is \nvital that we develop common practices and the \ncapacity to implement the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect. Protecting civilians from \natrocities, dear colleagues, is not just about protection. \n  \n \n11-50692 48 \n \nIt also means bringing the perpetrators of crimes and \natrocities against civilians to justice.  \n International law, in particular the International \nCriminal Court, and the understanding that justice will \nbe done, no matter how long it takes, are the tools we \npossess to prevent the worst human rights violations. \nThe rule of law and respect for international law are \nwhat will help ravaged and victimized societies to \nregain their dignity and rebuild their communities. The \ncommon efforts of the international community, the \nInternational Criminal Court and its States parties \nremain a priority for my country. \n While focusing on the pertinent issues of the \npresent, we must not shy away from addressing the \nunresolved issues of the recent past. Afghanistan is one \nof those. Establishing lasting security there remains a \nkey objective for Estonia. To reach that objective, we \nmust focus on assisting Afghan efforts to further \ndevelop good governance and the rule of law. Along \nwith human rights, these are the crucial elements of a \nsustainable society. We believe that we must all remain \ncommitted as long as is necessary to reach this goal. To \nthat end, Estonia will continue to support the access of \nAfghans, in particular women and children, to health \ncare and education through its development \ncooperation projects. \n Georgia is another country that continues to \nrequire our attention. The 2008 war ended with the \nviolation of Georgian territorial integrity, which is a \nfundamental violation of international law that remains \nunresolved to this day. The fundamental principles of \ninternational law must be followed by all members of \nthe international community and not just the small, \nwho have no other recourse. Additionally, we should \ncontinue to support the Geneva talks. The United \nNations involvement is of the utmost importance and \nmust continue in the future. \n Here today in the United Nations, our attention is \nalso focused on Israel and Palestine. A viable two-State \nsolution must take into consideration the legitimate \nconcerns of both sides for their well-being, safety and \nprosperity. \n Another security- and human rights-related topic \nis the Internet, especially these days, when it has come \nto play such an important role in democratization by \nenabling political discussion and mobilizing popular \nmovements. The Internet has grown beyond all \nexpectations since people began to use it regularly \nsome 20 years ago. Its global, ipso facto cross-border \nnature allows users the world over to access \ninformation and ideas, to communicate with each other \nand to learn. Estonia firmly believes that States should \nensure that their people can freely seek, receive and \nimpart information and ideas and have access to the \nInternet. In fact, Estonia believes that, in this \ntechnological age, unimpeded access to the Internet is a \nhuman right. \n A transparent Government and administration, a \nliberal economic environment and a strong educational \nsystem all have contributed to Estonia\u2019s success. \nEstonia\u2019s development over the past 20 years is proof \nthat information and communications technology can \nbe a springboard to success for all States. We are quite \nwilling to continue to share our experience, especially \nin increasing transparency and openness in \nGovernment, with other countries. \n The Internet, however, poses many dangers as \nwell. Increasingly disruptive cyberthreats and attacks \nthat can seriously harm entire communities and, \nindeed, cause harm to countless individuals, are a new \ndanger that we face. The large-scale cyberattacks \nagainst Estonia in 2007 created a new awareness \namong our people. The steps Estonia has taken towards \na more secure Internet, however, do not restrict our \npeople\u2019s freedoms. In fact, Freedom House\u2019s global \nassessment of Freedom on the Net 2011 rated Estonia \nas the freest in the world, demonstrating that a proper \nbalance between rights and security can be found \nwithout compromising either. \n We also bear responsibility for the environment \nwe live in. It was no accident that the democratic \nrevolutions of Central and Eastern Europe were \naccompanied, and indeed often instigated, by \nenvironmental movements. Citizens had become fed up \nwith the totalitarian system\u2019s abuse of nature and \ndisregard for human beings. Ignoring the state of its \ncitizens\u2019 health and surroundings, the totalitarian State \nexposed itself to be what it was \u2014 a self-serving clique \nhell-bent on maintaining its power, no matter what the \ncost to its people, no matter what pain and suffering \nensued. \n Today, the challenge we face is global. It is \nclimate change. Estonia\u2019s 2010 national security \nconcept states that climate change is also a security \nissue and can have a destabilizing effect. Estonia \nalready has decided to contribute to the fast-track \n \n \n49 11-50692 \n \nfinancing of efforts to combat climate change. We \nbelieve that sustainable development and the green \neconomy need a global approach, as exemplified by \npreparations for the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development next year.  \n One already evident consequence of climate \nchange is an increase in the number of people who \nneed clean water and food. Estonia will continue to \nincrease its contribution to the United Nations \nhumanitarian system. \n While the world\u2019s humanitarian needs grow, we \nrequire increased coordination and strict scrutiny of the \nreal needs of aid recipients. As donor Governments, we \nare doubly accountable, first to those who require \nassistance; but we are also accountable to our \ntaxpayers for the effective use of every Euro cent. If \nour taxpayers believe that Government is spending tax \nmoney unwisely or ineffectively, they will vote for a \nGovernment that cares less for foreign assistance \nexpenditures. In these days of ever greater financial \ndifficulty in donor countries themselves, this is not an \nobservation to be ignored. \n The many times I have addressed the General \nAssembly, I have deliberated on the nature of the \nUnited Nations and the need for reform. The United \nNations needs to change as the world around us \nchanges. System-wide coherence, delivering as one, \nand revitalization of the General Assembly are steps in \nthe right direction.  \n We welcome these changes, yet at the same time \nEstonia sincerely hopes that the same spirit will prevail \nin reform of the Security Council. If nations are not \ngiven a fair and equitable voice, proportional and \nappropriate to its role in today\u2019s world \u2014 not the world \nof 1945 \u2014 we will find that the Organization has ever \nless credibility. I propose that we adopt a new attitude \nof openness to new developments in order to make sure \nthat the United Nations as a whole can better deliver on \nthe undoubtedly important issues for which it is \nresponsible. \n In conclusion, let me say that history did not end \n20 years ago with the re-emergence of democratic \nnations in Central and Eastern Europe. Nor will history \nend with the Arab Spring. Democracy, freedom, human \nrights, the rule of law and sustainable development all \nrequire constant and consistent support and protection. \n The world faces challenges, new and old. We face \nthem daily. Today, as we commemorate the victims of \nthe 9/11 terrorist attack ten years ago here in New \nYork, we recognize how much the world has changed \nsince the United Nations was founded 66 years ago. We \nmust address and act upon these new challenges. It is \nwe, the United Nations, who need to keep pace with \nchanges and developments in the world we live in to \nprotect and promote universal values across the globe."

        "file_text": "His \nExcellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria, has given me \nthe honour of delivering this address to the General \nAssembly. At the outset, I wish to congratulate the \nPresident of the General Assembly for his assumption \nof the presidency at its sixty-sixth session. His \nprofessional experience in the United Nations and his \npersonal qualities will undoubtedly lead to the \nexcellent conduct and success of our work.  \n I also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph \nDeiss, for his efforts. Finally, I reiterate my \ncongratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-\nGeneral, upon his reappointment and express my \ncountry\u2019s satisfaction for the dynamic manner by \nwhich he is leading the work and role of the \nOrganization. \n Now that the Republic of South Sudan has joined \nthe family of the United Nations, on behalf of my \ncountry, I warmly congratulate the people and the \nGovernment of that kindred country.  \n The main theme of this session, namely, the role \nof mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans, was chosen at a time of aggravated tensions, \nthe recurrence of economic and financial crises, \nincreasing unresolved challenges and diminished \nefforts and cooperation in multilateralism.  \n Today\u2019s globalized but confused world has \nstrayed from its social structures and balances and been \ncrisscrossed by new, unregulated influences and \nunequal relationships. Therefore, the international \nsystem that was established in 1945 requires today \nadaptation to current demands in order to respond to \nthe expectations of the people of the world.  \n Algeria is following with special interest the \nongoing events in some countries in its region, which \nhave led to numerous lives lost and huge material \ndamage. Algeria deplores the violence experienced in \nsome countries, and reiterates its call for a political \nsettlement of all of those ongoing situations, based on \nthe aspirations of the people for freedom, justice and \ndemocracy, and respect for each country\u2019s sovereignty \nand for international law. \n With respect to Libya, Algeria expects a rapid \nrestoration of peace and security and the formation of a \nGovernment that represents all sections of Libyan \nsociety. We are convinced that Libya\u2019s stability is a \nfundamental element for the stability of the region as a \nwhole. From this podium, Algeria reaffirms its \ndetermination to work immediately with the new \nLibyan authorities to promote full, exemplary bilateral \ncollaboration based on a spirit of brotherhood and \nsolidarity. \n Recent developments on the Arab stage will not \nfail to directly affect the situation prevailing in the \nMiddle East. Continued Israeli occupation of Palestine \nand other occupied Arab territories, as well as the lack \nof genuine prospects for just and lasting peace in the \nregion are, in that regard, a source of deep concern for \nAlgeria. The stalemated peace process in the Middle \nEast, the continued building of settlements and the \ncontinued campaign to Judaize the holy city of \nAl-Quds continue daily to further distance any prospect \nof a just and lasting peace based on the principle of \nland for peace. \n That situation, which weighs heavy with risk and \nuncertainty in an already sensitive region, is both an \naffront to the peoples of the region and a challenge for \nthe entire international community. Among those \n  \n \n11-51390 6 \n \nchallenges, the inhumane embargo of Gaza and its \nseacoast constitutes a genuine collective punishment of \nits inhabitants.  \n The Palestinian Authority\u2019s initiative, at this \nsession, requesting that Palestine be recognized as a \nfull Member State of the United Nations is an \nopportunity for the United Nations to correct, to some \nextent, an injustice that has lasted for over 60 years \nnow. This admission will be a clear, unequivocal \nresponse by the international community showing its \ndetermination to impose international law and to reject \na policy of fait accompli.  \n In the same context, Algeria reiterates its concern \nat the persistence of coercive economic measures and \nunilateral sanctions against developing countries. I \nwould recall in this respect the embargo that has been \nimposed against Cuba for over half a century now.  \n There is another issue on the agenda of the \nUnited Nations that calls for special attention, namely, \nthe situation in the Western Sahara. Indeed, no effort \nmust be spared in promoting the path of dialogue and \nnegotiation, which is the only way that will enable the \nSaharawi people to freely express their right to self-\ndetermination. In this context, Algeria reiterates its \ncommitment to provide full support to the efforts of the \nSecretary-General and his Personal Envoy, and appeals \nto both parties, Morocco and the Frente Polisario, to \ndemonstrate a spirit of responsibility in settling this \nconflict, which has unfortunately lasted all too long. \n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the \nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The time has \ncome for the international community to reiterate its \nfull commitment to the fight against international \nterrorism. The progress made to date to eradicate this \nscourge does not yet satisfy us, nor does it allow us to \nlet down our guard. On the contrary, we should remain \nready to contribute appropriate solutions to the root \ncauses of terrorism and its many ramifications.  \n Algeria would thus take this opportunity to stress \nthe threefold need to, first, reach the necessary \nconsensus to hasten the adoption of an international \nconvention against terrorism; secondly, adopt a \nprotocol prohibiting the paying of ransoms to terrorist \ngroups; and finally, prevent the use of information and \ncommunications technologies for criminal purposes.  \n In order for this approach to succeed, we must \nensure a return to strict respect for the fundamentals of \nour cooperation, the preservation of the universal \ncharacter of our Organization, the primacy of \ninternational law and the full application of the rules of \nmultilateralism. \n The current weaknesses of world governance are \nillustrated on a daily basis in the various crises that we \nface. In this respect, I would refer first to the inability \nof the United Nations in general, and the Security \nCouncil in particular, to manage conflicts that threaten \ninternational peace and security or even to ensure the \nimplementation of their own resolutions. Secondly, I \nwould refer to the recent global economic and financial \ncrisis and its devastating effects, in particular its \nimpact on developing countries\u2019 economies. This crisis \nhas exposed a system subject to the vagaries of the \nmarket, which responds more to the need for large \nprivate companies to make a profit than to the need for \ngrowth and development. This system excludes the \ncountries of the South from both the management of \nrelevant international institutions and from setting the \nrules that govern them. Thirdly, I would mention the \ntragic effects of climate change, which are a real threat \nto the future of the international community.  \n Given these realities, we must adopt, within the \nframework of the United Nations, a global, inclusive \napproach in order to, first, ensure general reform of the \nUnited Nations as a precondition to the establishment \nof financial institutions that can respond to the \nexpectations of our countries and counter speculative \nmovements and the virtual markets\u2019 dominance over \nthe realities of the world economy. Secondly, the \nreform of the United Nations should make it possible \nfor an effective collective security system to emerge \nthat will be able to respond to the breadth and \ncomplexity of the challenges that the international \ncommunity faces. Thirdly, we must ensure the success \nof upcoming events and programmes on the United \nNations agenda, in order to achieve real awareness-\nraising and so that decisive action can be taken to settle \nthe problems caused by climate change. \n If Algeria is encouraging the adoption of a global \napproach at this crucial point of the world\u2019s \ndevelopment, it is because it has participated in certain \ninitiatives that have demonstrated how effective they \ncan be at the regional level. Here, I would refer to the \nmany efforts undertaken by the Sahel countries, along \nwith their partners, during the international conference \non development and the fight against terrorism held \nrecently in Algeria. This allowed us to make important \n \n \n7 11-51390 \n \ndecisions on containing the phenomenon of terrorism, \nreducing its effects and attacking its root causes. \nBeyond the fight against terrorism, the conference also \ninsisted on highlighting a priority that is often \nforgotten, which is putting the issue of development at \nthe very heart of all cooperation efforts. Such \ncooperation, which is currently very crucial at the \nregional level, requires support from our partners that \nresponds to the needs expressed by our countries. \n I would like to devote the last part of my \ncomments to recent measures undertaken by my \ncountry to reinforce political, economic and social \nreforms aimed at strengthening the rule of law and \ngood governance. On the political and institutional \nlevels, these reforms include a review of the \nConstitution, the adoption of a new law on information \nand the media, the decriminalization of press offences, \nan opening of audiovisual media, an amendment of the \nlaw on political parties and of the electoral law, and the \nstrengthening of the role of women in elected bodies.  \n These political reforms are based on our firm \ndesire to promote human rights as broadly as possible, \nas was reiterated to all the special rapporteurs who \nhave visited Algeria since November 2010. \n On the economic level, decisive measures have \nbeen taken to improve the business climate, free up \nproductive energy and reinforce the role of companies \nand institutions as the drivers of growth and \ndevelopment. On the social level, as Algeria is \nconcerned about the future of its youth, it has increased \nthe number of its assistance and employment \nprogrammes for the various categories of youth so that \nthey can make a smooth integration into the labour \nmarket. These measures will of course lead to a \nstrengthening of the democratic process and of the rule \nof law through an inclusive approach that brings \ntogether all the political and social forces in my \ncountry."

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to \ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. I am confident that his able \nleadership will lead this session to a successful result. \nMy congratulations also go to the Republic of South \nSudan on its admission to the United Nations. \n This year marks the twentieth year of \nmembership of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \n \n \n11 11-51681 \n \nKorea in the United Nations. Our country joined the \nUnited Nations as a result of its desire to defend world \npeace and achieve mankind\u2019s common prosperity, \nworking together with all United Nations Members. \nSince that time, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea has remained faithful to the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, as it \nhad pledged. \n However, given the present status of international \nrelations, the logic of power and highhanded politics \nhas become all the more obvious, thus negating the \nprinciple of sovereign equality, despite the efforts and \ndesires of the United Nations Member States. A few \ncountries are involved in interference in internal affairs \nand the use of force against sovereign States in an \nattempt to dominate regions where they feel they have \nstrategic interests under the pretext of protecting \ncivilians and defending peace.  \n Regrettably, the United Nations has been misused \nin this process. International law and order have been \nviolated and undermined by the arbitrary and high-\nhanded acts of some major Powers. Given that current \nreality Member States should reaffirm the principle of \ndefending peace and sovereign equality as enshrined in \nthe Charter of the United Nations, and speed up the \nprocess of reform of the United Nations, including \nenhancing the power of the General Assembly. \n A long time ago, the General Assembly adopted \nresolutions on dismantling the United Nations \nCommand in Korea and putting an end to the United \nStates blockade against Cuba, which have not been \nimplemented so far. This is just a random example that \nhighlights the urgent need to enhance the authority of \nthe General Assembly. To enhance the authority of the \nGeneral Assembly it is urgently necessary to put in \nplace a mechanism whereby Security Council \nresolutions related to peace and security, such as those \non sanctions and the use of force, are subject to the \napproval of the General Assembly before they take \neffect. \n Two other areas where the prevailing logic of \npower in international relations can clearly be seen are \nthe Third Committee of the General Assembly and the \nHuman Rights Council. Though it is said that reform is \nintended to put an end to politicization, selectivity and \ndouble standards in dealing with human rights issues, \nthere still remains the prevailing reality whereby \nspecific countries are selected for discussion of their \nhuman rights situations, while other major human \nrights violators are simply passed over in silence, all in \naccordance with the political objectives and interests of \nthe West and the criteria of Western values. It is our \nview that the reform process of the human rights \nbodies should be intensified, so as to enhance the \nsystem that seeks to ensure genuine freedoms and \nrights for the people of all countries, and respect for \ntheir diverse histories, cultures, ideas and systems. \n Meanwhile, some progress has been made in the \nfield of sustainable development, one of the three goals \nset by the United Nations for the last two decades \nfollowing the Rio Declaration on Environment and \nDevelopment. However, we are still faced with \ntremendous challenges. \n We consider that the United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development to be held in 2012 should \ntake practical steps towards the creation of a peaceful \nenvironment for development, the establishment of fair \ninternational economic and trade relations, the removal \nof sanctions, the implementation of official \ndevelopment assistance commitments, the transfer of \nenvironmentally friendly technology and increased \nfinancial assistance to developing countries. \n It is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people \nto live free of the Israeli occupation and to create an \nindependent State of their own. It is also an obligation \nof the international community to admit Palestine as a \nfull-fledged United Nations Member State. The \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea recognized \nPalestine as a State in 1988 and we support its \nadmission to the United Nations. We believe that the \naspirations of the Palestine people will be translated \ninto a reality. \n Today in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, a general campaign is on in full swing to build a \npowerful State, under the wise leadership of the great \nGeneral Kim Jong Il. The Government of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is \nconcentrating all its resources on economic \ndevelopment, with a main emphasis on significantly \nimproving the people\u2019s livelihood. We are achieving \nunprecedented and remarkable success. Our economic \ndevelopment in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea will make a meaningful contribution to the \nefforts of the international community to foster \nregional development and to attain the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n  \n \n11-51681 12 \n \n In that context, a stable and peaceful environment \nis a vital prerequisite for the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea and its people today in their struggle \nfor economic development. To our regret, however, the \nKorean peninsula does not yet have with a lasting and \nstable peace mechanism. The national division imposed \nby outside forces and the fragile armistice that leaves \nus in a state of neither war nor peace have now been in \nplace for more than half a century. That is the stark \nreality of the Korean peninsula. \n Despite the unanimous aspirations and desires of \nall the people at home and abroad who want peace and \nstability, the arms build-up and nuclear war exercises \ncontinue to be staged one after another against the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea in and around \nthe Korean peninsula. Because of that, there is a \nconstant recurrence of a dangerous situation on the \nKorean peninsula, which is often driven to a brink of \nwar.  \n The prevailing situation not only poses a grave \nthreat to the sovereignty and security of our Republic \nbut also obstructs the efforts of our people to achieve \npeaceful development. Had it not been for the Songun \nideology implemented by the great leader of our \npeople, General Kim Jong Il, and had it not been for \nour powerful war deterrent, the Korean peninsula \nwould have been turned into a theatre of war scores of \ntimes and our peaceful economic development would \nhave been unimaginable. \n The Government of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea remains consistent in its stand to \nsecure peace and stability and move towards the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula through \ndialogue and negotiation. The present circumstances of \nthe Korean peninsula require all parties concerned to \nseize the opportunity for dialogue and take courageous \ndecisions to act boldly on solving the fundamental \nissues. \n The continued existence of the tense situation on \nthe Korean peninsula is attributable to the hostile \nrelations between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea and the United States, which give rise to \nmistrust and confrontation. As long as hostility exists \nbetween the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nand the United States, with the parties to the Military \nArmistice Agreement levelling guns at each other, \nmistrust and confrontation will not dissipate and the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not be \npossible. \n It was with that in mind that the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea proposed again last year to \nhold talks for replacing the Armistice Agreement with \na peace agreement. The signing of a peace agreement \nas part of implementing resolution 3390 (XXX), \nadopted at the thirtieth session of the General \nAssembly in 1975, would be the most effective \nconfidence-building measure towards alleviating the \nmistrust between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea and the United States, and would further serve \nas a driving force for ensuring the denuclearization of \nthe Korean peninsula. \n Denuclearization of the whole Korean peninsula \nwas the last instruction given by the great leader of the \nKorean people, President Kim Il Sung. The \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula specified in \nthe Joint Statement of 19 September 2005 is a process \nof turning the whole Korean peninsula into a nuclear-\nfree zone based on complete removal in a verifiable \nmanner of the actual nuclear threat to the Korean \npeninsula from the outside. \n The issue of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula \noriginated, for all intents and purposes, from the \nhostile policy and nuclear war threats of the United \nStates against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea. Such being the case, the United States is the \nmain party that is responsible for and capable of \nremoving the root cause of the problem. The nuclear \nissue would never have been raised at all, if the United \nStates had refrained from deploying nuclear weapons \nin the Korean peninsula and threatening the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea with nuclear \narms. \n Under the present circumstances, in which the \nKorean peninsula stands at the crossroad of either a \nrelaxation of tension or a continuation of the vicious \ncycle of aggravation of tension, the United States \nshould boldly abandon its hostile policy against the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and move \ntowards full-fledged dialogue, proceeding from its \nlong-term strategic vision. The Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea will make strenuous efforts in the \nfuture as well to establish a durable and lasting peace \nmechanism on the Korean peninsula and will continue \nto cooperate with all parties concerned for \nunconditional resumption of the Six-Party Talks. \n \n \n13 11-51681 \n \n Inter-Korean relations have been developing \nfavourably on the Korean peninsula since the \npublication of the June 15 North-South Joint \nDeclaration. However, it is extremely unfortunate that \nNorth-South relations have now been aggravated to \ntheir worst state ever, with a widespread atmosphere of \nwarmongering and confrontation with fellow \ncountrymen, after the current South Korean authorities \ntook office. There is a serious problem behind all that, \nthe issue of fundamental contradictions and antagonism \nin the approach towards the reunification of the Korean \npeninsula. \n Different ideas and systems exist now in the \nNorth and the South of Korea. Given that reality, the \nchoice of method of reunification is itself a vital issue \nthat will lead either to national reunification or to \nnational disaster. The North and the South of Korea, \nthrough the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration of \n2000, recognized that there is common ground in the \nfederal formula proposed by the North and the \nconfederal one proposed by the South for reunification, \nand agreed to orient the reunification along this \ndirection in the future. \n That agreement between the North and the South \nenjoyed warm support and was welcomed by our \nfellow countrymen and the international community, \nincluding the United Nations. But the present South \nKorean authorities reneged on the June 15 North-South \nJoint Declaration on the agreed reunification method \nand came up with what they called the theory of \nunification through absorption, which presupposes the \ncollapse of the other party, and thus put inter-Korean \nrelations into a phase of touch-and-go confrontation \nand increased the danger of war with each passing day. \n In view of the prevailing reality of the Korean \npeninsula, the so called unification through absorption \nis a road to war, whereas the federal formula is a road \nto peace. The federal formula is a realistic proposal for \nreunification premised on coexistence and the best \npossible method of reunification able to prevent war. It \nis also a reasonable proposal for reunification that \naccords with the interests of the region and the \nneighbouring countries, as it presupposes the neutrality \nof the reunified State. \n If the present South Korean authorities truly want \nto see the relaxation of tensions in the Korean \npeninsula and an improvement in inter-Korean \nrelations, they should abandon their confrontational \nattitude against peace and reunification and switch over \nto a policy of respecting and fully implementing the \n15 June Joint Declaration and 4 October Declaration, \nagreed at the summit level between the North and the \nSouth. \n The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will, \nin the future, further strengthen and develop friendly \nand cooperative relations with all United Nations \nMember States, in accordance with its foreign policy \nprinciples of independence, peace and friendship, and \nwill do its level best to defend peace and security in the \nKorean peninsula and in the rest of the world and to \npromote joint development and the common prosperity \nof all humankind."

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure \nthat I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the \npresidency. I must also congratulate His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon warmly on his reappointment as \nSecretary-General and we look forward to working \nwith him constructively.  \n As we gather here today, it is appropriate to \nreflect on the values and ideals that inspire the United \nNations system. One of the principal attributes is the \nspirit of flexibility, which has always been a feature of \nthe United Nations. We must acknowledge the need for \nthat spirit of openness and adaptability today more than \nat any other time. That is because the foundations of \nthe world order are being transformed dramatically and \nfundamentally. At the heart of those changes is the \nneed to protect the smaller countries in the developing \nworld and to advance their interests vigorously.  \n In the midst of uncertainty there are some things \nthat must remain constant. They reflect our most \ncherished beliefs and convictions. Despite repeated \nreferences in this Assembly by many member countries \nto the right of the Palestinian people to a State of their \nown within secure borders, we still have not been able \nto make it a reality. It is a cause of profound \ndisappointment that this has not yet happened. There is \na window of opportunity now and we must make use of \nit before it is too late. It is time for decisive action \nrather than more discussion. That will be in the interest \nof the security and well-being of the entire region, \nincluding Israel. \n The need for sustained support for the countries \nof the African continent at this critical time is also \nworthy of mention. It is important to remind ourselves \nthat every country cherishes the values, traditions and \ndeeply held religious convictions it has nurtured over \nthe centuries. They cannot be diluted or distorted under \nthe guise of human rights by the imposition of attitudes \nor approaches that are characteristics of alien cultures. \nIf that were to be done, it would amount to a violation \nof human rights in a fundamental sense. It must also be \npointed out that, even where sanctions are imposed, \nextreme care has to be taken to ensure that the people \nat large, men, women and children yet to be born, are \nnot harmed by such action. I would also express once \nagain my solidarity with the people of Cuba and wish \nthem all success. \n While the clash of ideas, opinions and values \ncontinues, we have clearly to recognize that dialogue, \ndeliberation and consensus offer the only viable means \nfor resolving differences. The might of powerful \nnations cannot prevail against justice and fair play. In \nthe troubled times in which we live we can derive \nguidance from the wise words of Gautama the Buddha, \nwho advised the Lichchhavi Princes, whose energies \nwere being consumed by bitter disputes among them, \n \n \n15 11-51185 \n \nthat the way forward consisted of meeting, discussing \nand departing in an atmosphere of amity and goodwill. \nThat represents the essential spirit of the United \nNations and is particularly relevant today.  \n The most significant challenge to stability and \nprogress in the modern world is posed by the menace \nof terrorism. Recent experience the world over amply \ndemonstrates that inconsistent standards and \ndiscriminatory approaches can unintentionally give a \nfresh lease of life to the forces of terror. An explicit \nand uniform response that refuses to recognize political \nshades of terrorism is required. \n Terrorism presents a threat from which not even \nthe wealthiest and most powerful nations are immune. \nIt must be remembered also that terrorist groups \nfrequently operate under the guise of front \norganizations. Conferring legitimacy on such \norganizations has had the inevitable effect of providing \ncomfort and encouragement to the merchants of terror. \nAs the leader of a nation that has paid a heavy price \nbecause of terrorism over a quarter of a century, I \nunderline that we must firmly resolve to rid the world \nof terrorism. We need to have solid, practical action on \nthe ground and send out our collective message on this \nissue loud and clear and universally. \n The interests of the developing world need to be \nprotected in another significant respect. It is vitally \nimportant to insist that the structures and procedures of \nmultilateral organizations should be uniform and \nconsistent and devoid of discrimination. My country \nhas reason for concern at approaches tainted by an \nunacceptable degree of selectivity, which we brought to \nthe notice of such organizations in recent weeks. The \ndeveloping world must keep a vigil against such \nirregular modalities, which should be resisted through \nour collective strength. Today, after three decades of \npain and anguish, Sri Lankans of all ethnicities, living \nin all parts of Sri Lanka, are free from the Liberation \nTigers of Tamil Eelam terror and no longer live in a \nstate of fear. However, I am deeply mindful that the \nbattle for peace is every bit as important and difficult \nas the struggle against terror. After the eradication of \nterrorism, my Government turned its undivided \nattention to building anew the foundations of a unified \nand vibrant nation, drawing upon the inherent strengths \nof our country and in particular the unique calibre of \nour human potential. \n It is justifiable for us to be proud of our nation\u2019s \nachievements during the brief span of the 30 months \nsince the beginning of the post-conflict phase. The \nresettlement of more than 95 per cent of the internally \ndisplaced persons, who constituted the largest number \nof civilians forcibly held by a terrorist group at any \ntime, while continuing even today to clear the mines \nlaid by terrorists in extensive areas, is an achievement \nof which we can be proud. Today in the Northern \nProvince our armed forces are engaged in the \ndevelopment of the infrastructure that was destroyed \nby the terrorists during a period of three decades. \nContrary to malicious propaganda the numbers of \narmed forces personnel present in the Northern \nProvince has been kept at a minimal level. Revival of \nthe economy has enhanced incomes and improved \nlivelihoods. Ex-combatants and other cadres, after \nexposure to programmes of vocational training and \ncounselling, have been reintegrated into society. The \nelectoral process has been restored after decades, \nmaking possible the emergence of a democratic \nleadership. \n These are among our valued accomplishments. \nThe remarkable growth of 22 per cent of the economy \nof the Northern Province is a clear indication of the \nsuccess achieved by the Government\u2019s initiatives with \nregard to development in that part of the country. The \ngross domestic product growth of the country has been \nconsistent at 8 per cent, and unemployment is at a \nrecord low of 4.5 per cent. It is also worthy of mention \nthat, in the assessment by the World Economic Forum \nin its Global Competitiveness Report for 2011-2012, \nSri Lanka shows dramatic improvement, moving up to \nfifty-second from their rank of seventy-ninth over a \nspan of two years. It is worthy of note that all these \ndevelopments have taken place within the brief space \nof 30 months \u2014 an achievement all the more \nsignificant because of our strong emphasis on \nreconciliation. Important as economic development is, \nwe have attached the highest priority to fostering the \nspirit of inclusivity and removing any remnants of \nbitterness from the hearts and minds of all our people. \nOver the past 30 months we have recruited 669 Tamil \npolice officers, bringing the total number of Tamil \nofficers to 1,143, while plans are afoot to recruit more \nthis year and in the future. After more than two decades \na census is being conducted in the Northern Province \nas part of the national census, to provide a firm basis \nfor our initiatives.  \n  \n \n11-51185 16 \n \n As a result of these achievements, what we see in \nSri Lanka today is a self-reliant nation with robust \nhopes for the future and a strong economy, \nstrengthened by inward investment flows, \nunprecedented expansion of tourism, and significant \ngrowth in volume of international trade. With a view to \nconsolidating these trends and leaving behind us the \ntrauma of the past, we ask of the international \ncommunity the hand of friendship and goodwill, based \non an understanding of our nation\u2019s determination to \nconfront with courage the challenge of a new era in our \nhistory. We ask our friends in distant lands to drop \npreconceived notions. We strongly believe in home-\ngrown solutions for them to be sustainable. It is clearly \nimpractical to conceive of universal remedies for \nproblems that afflict our societies. My country, as it \ncomes out of the darkness of the past three decades \ninto the light and promise of the future, must be \nafforded the time and space to seek its destiny in \naccordance with the wishes of its people. That is in \nkeeping with the values enshrined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and the whole body of international law \nthat governs us. \n A further consideration that the international \ncommunity should take into account is the \nvulnerability of developing nations, and it should make \nprovision by means of appropriate institutional \narrangements for their protection. As I observed when \ninaugurating the fiftieth anniversary meeting of the \nAsian-African Legal Consultative Organization in \nColombo three months ago, the dumping of \ncommercial and industrial goods manufactured in \ndeveloped countries imperils the economies of many \nAsian and African countries represented here. \n In conclusion, let me say that the use of \nsubstantial subsidies by treasuries and reserve banks to \nsupport agricultural production in the developed world, \nand other forms of protectionism, cause a serious \ndistortion in the interplay of market forces and greatly \nreduce the ability of farmers in many developing \ncountries to access international markets for their \nexport products on an equitable basis. The \ndisproportionate pollution of the environment by \nindustrialized countries and the resultant impact on \nglobal warming and climate change cannot be \nremedied with any semblance of justice by imposing \nharsh restraints on developing countries, which have \ncontributed very little to aggravate the problem. These \ncircumstances heighten the importance of social equity \nat the international level.  \n May the Noble Triple Gem bless you all."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I would like to cordially congratulate Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser of the State of Qatar on his \nelection to the post of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of our \nfull support for his endeavours in that capacity. \n I am honoured to speak on behalf of my country \nat this session of the General Assembly and to be able \nto address in this historic place representatives of all \nthe countries of the world. Our participation at this \nsession is also an opportunity for dialogue, a chance to \nget acquainted with the problems of nations from \ndifferent regions of the world and to learn about their \nachievements and aspirations \u2014 and also their \nconcerns and fears. It is an opportunity for reflection \non how to deal with the challenges faced by \nhumankind \u2014 by all of us. \n I speak here on behalf of a country that over the \npast two decades has become a symbol of positive \nchange \u2014 change that required courage and hard work. \nAt the time of the collapse of the communist system, \nPoland was a country with a devastated State economy \nand an impoverished society. It was a country uncertain \nof its borders and its place in Europe. Thanks to deep \neconomic and political transformations, Poland has \nbecome a country that enjoys stable democracy and a \ndynamic economy. It has become a country that makes \nan important contribution to international relations in \nEurope and to security and stability in its immediate \nenvironment and beyond.  \n Since 2008, in the course of the financial crisis, \nthe Polish economy has maintained a positive growth \nrate. It is the only country in the European Union to do \nso. That was possible thanks to the work and the \nentrepreneurial spirit of the Polish people and thanks to \nsuccessive Governments\u2019 courage in making difficult \ndecisions. \n In its foreign policy, Poland is building good-\nneighbourly relations with the countries of Central and \nEastern Europe, strengthening the security and unity of \nEurope. A hallmark of Polish foreign policy remains its \nsolidarity with nations that aspire to live in freedom \nbased on democracy and respect for human rights. That \n  \n \n11-50871 2 \n \nis an obligation derived from our national experience, \nthe experience of the non-violent struggle of the \nSolidarity trade union, which paved the way for \ndemocratic and economic transitions in the countries of \nthe former communist bloc.  \n We now stand ready to share our experience. That \nis our active and consistent approach in relation to the \nsocieties of Eastern Europe and, recently, in relation to \nthe societies of Arab States, some of which have taken \nup a challenge similar to ours 20 years ago. We wish \nthem luck, perseverance and courage, not only to fight \nfor change but also to conduct dialogue and \ncommunicate with all those who can take part in this \nprocess. From our Polish experience we know that \nsometimes the inability to communicate and reach \ncompromises and to overcome internal divisions \u2014 the \ninability to open oneself to dialogue with those who \njust recently were seen as enemies \u2014 hinders progress \nand can cause the failure of movements initiating \nmajor, necessary changes. \n Today I speak on behalf of the country that holds \nthe presidency of the Council of the European Union \n(EU). The Union has become in recent decades a \nlaboratory of huge positive developments in \ninternational life. The beginning of the integration \nprocess, with the creation of the European Coal and \nSteel Community 60 years ago, was a Copernican \nrevolution in international relations. A mechanism to \neffectively eliminate war between countries that \nseemed to be permanently in conflict with each other \nwas successfully introduced. Archenemies have \nbecome irreplaceable friends. The number of countries \nthat have opted for cooperation rather than conflict has \nbeen steadily growing.  \n That has given Europe an unprecedented long \nperiod of peace and enabled economic and social \ndevelopment not only in the sphere of the market but \nalso in the field of human rights and in equalizing the \nlevels of development. The European Union provides \nits members with security, stimulates their \ndevelopment and provides assistance to less developed \nregions and social groups. That is possible thanks to a \nprinciple of solidarity that goes beyond State borders. \n The European Union has introduced a new \nquality to international life globally. It stabilizes its \nneighbourhood and is an inspiration and a role model \nin various regions of the world, where integration \ninitiatives derive from the European experience. The \nEuropean Union is also an active participant in the \nprocess of shaping a better world order for everyone. \nThe progress that the world has experienced after the \nCold War in the fields of human rights, international \nsecurity and arms reductions, environmental \nprotection, sustainable development and many other \nareas is for the most part due to the initiatives and \ninvolvement of the European Union \u2014 as Mr. Herman \nVan Rompuy, the President of the European Council, \nsaid here earlier (see ). \n I am convinced that not only will Europe\u2019s \ncurrent difficulties \u2014 at the moment related to the \nfinancial standing of some of its member States \u2014 be \novercome but that the EU will actually emerge stronger \nfrom the crisis. I am also convinced that the European \nsocial model and the model of EU relations with the \noutside world will remain an important point of \nreference for other regions of the world. Poland, which \ncurrently holds the presidency of the Council of the \nEuropean Union, will spare no effort in ensuring that \nEurope remains committed to global affairs and can be \ncounted on, as always. Europe\u2019s solidarity with the \nworld and its openness will remain our priority. \n The challenges facing the international \ncommunity are considerable. The past decade in \ninternational life has been turbulent and difficult. Its \nbeginning was marked by the tragic terrorist attacks \nhere in New York, on 11 September 2001. The spectre \nof global terrorism has hung over the world, in the fear \nthat terrorist organizations one day may make use of a \nweapon of mass destruction. Fortunately, our worst \nfears have not materialized and it has been possible to \nsignificantly reduce the terrorist threat. \n At the same time, the atmosphere of the war on \nterror has been a hindrance to fostering trust, \nstrengthening international stability and solving other \nimportant problems. In the past decade we have had to \ndeal with increasing tensions between rich and poor, \nand between more and less developed countries and \nregions of the world. There have been signs of cross-\ncultural mistrust. Climate change negotiations, the new \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) trade round and \nnon-proliferation discussions are stalled. The Middle \nEast peace process is not advancing. In addition to \nthose negative trends, the international community was \nhit by the financial crisis in September 2008. \n We cannot ignore these disturbing phenomena \nand signals. Nonetheless, there is good reason to be \n \n \n3 11-50871 \n \noptimistic and to believe that we can overcome \ndifficulties and effectively face challenges. Hopes have \nbeen engendered by the economic growth that has been \nseen in many countries and regions that were once \nreferred to as underdeveloped countries or the third \nworld. Many countries have been able to seize the \nopportunities made available by globalization and give \ntheir societies prospects for development and \nprosperity. The responsible attitude of many \nGovernments, within the Group of 20 and beyond, \nprevented the financial turbulence of 2008 from \nescalating into an economic crisis similar to the Great \nDepression of 1929. Openness and interdependence \nprevailed over protectionism and economic \nnationalism. President Barack Obama\u2019s initiatives to \nreduce nuclear arms and ensure their non-proliferation \nshould be viewed in a similar manner. \n The Arab Spring, notwithstanding the dramatic \nevents surrounding it, is yet another step in the \ntransition of countries in various regions of the world \ntowards democracy and the empowerment of \nindividuals and societies on the basis of respect for \ntheir aspirations to live in freedom and prosperity. \nThese are aspirations to a life that is in harmony with \nvalues and standards that are not \u2014 as they were \nconsidered to be until recently \u2014 exclusively Western. \nEveryone, everywhere, is entitled to embrace those \nvalues; however, it is necessary to respect the local \naspects and dimensions of these aspirations and rights, \nwhich cannot be separated from their cultural context. \n The path to solving key global problems \ninevitably leads us to the United Nations or its \nspecialized agencies. Not so long ago we faced the risk \nof a marginalizing of the United Nations, or even the \nbuilding of parallel structures. The United Nations, \nhowever, remains indispensable in its role, as defined \nin the Charter and the main United Nations documents, \nespecially those from the years 2000 and 2005. We in \nPoland combine optimism with realism, so we like the \ndescription of the United Nations that says that our \nOrganization was not created to take mankind to \nheaven, but to save humanity from hell. \n The Organization faces many tasks, whose aim is \nto protect the international community against crises \nand a decline at the international level. The United \nNations must defend the already achieved level of \ncivilized relations among nations, a key factor of which \nis the move away from violence towards the self-\ndetermination of nations, democracy and material \nprosperity. \n I see the main tasks of the Organization as falling \nwithin the framework adopted in the 2005 World \nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1), which focused on \nthe triad of development, security and human rights. I \nam aware of the complexity and extent of the problems \nrelated to development, which encompass the issues of \ntrade, finance, economic growth, environmental \nprotection and development aid. I am aware of the \nlimitations of the United Nations in this area, where the \nmain instruments are in the hands of private entities \u2014 \ncorporations, banks, stock exchanges and investment \nfunds. The United Nations and its specialized agencies, \nthe Bretton Woods institutions and others have proved \nin the past how useful they are in this area. \n Today our Organization must ensure the effective \nprovision of aid to the poorest and to those in real \nneed. They are the ones that are hardest hit by the \ncrisis. Our responsibility is to limit the scourge of \nhunger in the world and help in combating pandemics \nand in providing access to drinking water. Without \nensuring a minimal subsistence level for people, as \nwell as health care and basic education, it is difficult to \nexpect the poorest and those in real need to begin to \nfend for themselves. \n We must agree on a new paradigm for global \neconomic trade. Global equilibrium requires that States \nwith a high surplus of exports over imports begin to \nswitch to growth, stimulated by internal consumption. \nIncidentally, it was domestic demand that saved Poland \nfrom the economic crisis following 2008. If we fail to \nbalance the relationship between these two groups of \neconomies \u2014 export- and import-oriented \u2014 there will \nbe more turbulence in the global system. Developing \ncountries must increasingly take responsibility for the \nglobal economy. This includes responsibility for the \nleast developed countries, which cannot be limited to \nimports, as this prevents the development of their own \nmanufacturing and export potential. United Nations \nagencies and entities not related to the Organization, \nsuch as the WTO, must assist in the evolution of this \nparadigm. \n The issue of international security, in both its \nbroader and narrower senses, requires a new approach. \nHere I shall confine myself to the latter. Poland has a \nstrong interest in progress in the reduction of nuclear \nand conventional arms. We are concerned about the \n  \n \n11-50871 4 \n \nprospect of returning to the arms race, as well as by the \nincrease in spending on armaments on a global scale. \nMore attention should be paid to the categories of \nweapons that today account for the most deaths. They \ncause conflicts, mainly internal, and they are the main \nfactors of instability in various regions of the world. It \nis from that perspective that we should reform the \nUnited Nations Conference on Disarmament. We fully \nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General to that end. \n Security in a broad sense and respect for human \nrights and the various forms of a transition towards \ndemocracy, that is, ultimately building a lasting peace, \ndepends on the ability to communicate, to negotiate \nand to compromise. In that respect, the role of the \nUnited Nations is irreplaceable. The United Nations \nhas been, is and must remain the main forum and \ninstrument for international mediation. We in Poland \nand Europe know from our own experience the value \nof this way of resolving difficult social and political \nproblems. The Polish round table of 1989 paved the \nway for transformation in our part of Europe. I am \nconvinced of its usefulness in the process of the Arab \nSpring, particularly with respect to the difficult \nsituation that arose in Syria, a country of great Islamic \nculture and tradition. We are ready to share this \nexperience with the societies that would like to do so. \nMediation is an irreplaceable way to achieve lasting \nand just peace.  \n This also applies to solving very difficult \nproblems in the relations between Israel and its \nneighbours, especially with the Palestinian Authority. I \nurge the United Nations and the Secretary-General to \nactively use this means of building trust and peace \nbetween peoples, cultures and different social groups \nwho frequently, and for legitimate reasons, find \nthemselves in a situation of conflict or even war. \n The spirit of solidarity must permeate the activity \nof our Organization, which aims for peace, security, \ndevelopment and respect for human rights. Si vis \npacem para solidaritatem (A/55/PV.17, p. 32) are \nwords expressed here in 2001 by former Auschwitz \nprisoner and Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs \nWladyslaw Bartoszewski. The spirit of solidarity has \nbeen the source of Polish success since 1989, and \ncontinues to be a value and source of strength for the \nentire European Union. Nevertheless, it also continues \nto be needed on a global scale at this time of openness \nand interdependence between countries, economies and \nsocieties. This requires an awareness of the unity of \nhumankind and a consciousness of the deep \ncommonality of interests among the members of the \ninternational community. The failure to respect this \nwill mean failure to effectively take on the challenges \nthe international community faces. In that regard, I \nhave only highlighted a few examples.  \n Finally, being here, I cannot resist recalling the \nimportant words of my great compatriot, Pope John \nPaul II. Speaking in the Hall in October 1995, he said:  \n \u201cThe answer to the fear which darkens human \nexistence at the end of the century is the common \neffort to build a civilization of love, founded on \nthe universal values of peace, solidarity, justice \nand liberty. And the soul of the civilization of \nlove is the culture of freedom: the freedom of \nindividuals and the freedom of nations, lived in \nself-giving solidarity and responsibility.\u201d"

Two global wars exposed our vulnerability \nto leaders and nations that do not hesitate to use \nviolence to resolve disputes and underscored the need \nfor an international system to govern the behaviour of \nStates. \n That is the rules-based framework that underpins \neverything we want to build, raise and do as one \nUnited Nations.

When they realize the \ninjustice of repressive and iniquitous rule, they do not \nhesitate to bring effective and positive change.  \n We must continue to work to eliminate nuclear \nweapons and curtail the illicit trade in conventional \nweapons and in small and light arms in order to \npreserve peace and our very existence. The successful \n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons showed the \ncollective resolve of States parties to move further \nforward in ridding the world of those weapons. We \nhave already agreed to convene a conference by 2012 \non the establishment of a Middle East zone free of \nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. The holding of that conference will take us \ncloser to our goal.  \n To build peace, we need to provide and \nstrengthen conditions that encourage the full progress \nand prosperity of all nations and peoples. We must \nensure that international trade and development \nsupport that end. The Philippines therefore calls for a \nfair, open and rules-based multilateral trading system \n  \n \n11-51687 2 \n \nand the conclusion of the Doha Round. We must \nlikewise redouble our efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. The target date of \n2015 is upon us and much work remains to be done. \nThe Philippines is one of world\u2019s 17 mega-\ndiverse countries and has a great stake in ensuring that \nglobal biodiversity is protected and maintained. We \nhave been described as the epicentre of global marine \nbiodiversity, and we host the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Center for Biodiversity. As \nwe look forward to the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development next year, we join the call for \na more powerful expression of the entire world\u2019s \npolitical commitment to sustainable development. \n With the human person at the core of all our \nefforts, we must always strive to uphold human dignity \nand human rights. That holds true for migrant workers. \nThe Philippines has close to 10 million Filipinos \noverseas, contributing to global socio-economic \ndevelopment. In line with the rules-based approach, the \nPhilippines supports the establishment of guidelines \nthat would ensure the welfare of all migrant workers. \n Additionally, we must renew our resolve to \naddress the evils of human trafficking. The Philippines \nis a founding member of the Group of Friends United \nagainst Human Trafficking, an informal association of \nUnited Nations Member States that seeks to help \nreinvigorate and consolidate the global fight against \ntrafficking in persons. At the core of the initiative is the \nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons. \n Aside from establishing rules to protect migrant \nworkers and to prevent human trafficking, the global \ncommunity needs to explore measures to more \neffectively assist developing countries in evacuating \ntheir nationals in instances of disaster or internal \nconflict. The Philippines also supports efforts at the \nUnited Nations to enhance partnerships, including with \nprivate sector actors, in strengthening the international \nhumanitarian and emergency response system. \n The Philippines recognizes that the promotion \nand protection of human rights are of vital importance \nto securing peace and socio-economic development, \npromoting the rule of law and strengthening \ndemocracies. The Philippines Government likewise \nrecognizes women as agents of socio-economic growth \nand change, and thus strongly advocates their full \nparticipation in nation-building. \n The Philippines is pleased to announce that, on \n30 August, we deposited our instrument of ratification \nof the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \nCourt. This was an historic moment for my country and \nmy people. We have stood up against the impunity of \ncolonial rule and of a dictatorship. Now, we stand \ntogether with the rest of the world in saying \u201cnever \nagain\u201d to impunity in any corner of our world. \n Firm in the desire to contribute to global efforts \nto safeguard the world against impunity, the \nPhilippines has fielded a candidate for election to the \nCourt, Ms. Miriam Defensor-Santiago, an experienced \ntrial judge and international legal scholar with a \ndistinguished and long career in public service. We ask \nall our partners and friends to support her candidature. \n As we look to strengthen the ramparts of peace, \nwe recognize the important role and contributions of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The \nPhilippines stands ready to do its part to ensure that the \nlines of peace are fortified and continuously expanded. \nThe Philippines lauds the heightened interaction and \ndialogue among the Secretariat, the General Assembly, \nthe Security Council, troop- and police-contributing \ncountries and other key stakeholders in the global \npeacekeeping agenda. \n As we strive to reinforce peacekeeping operations \non land, so too should we continue to exert efforts in \nmaintaining stability and security at sea. Maritime \npiracy, after all, imperils the lives of seafarers and \ndisrupts global trade. Today, around 70 Filipino \nseafarers are still being held hostage by pirates \noperating in the Gulf of Aden and the wider Indian \nOcean. We must continue to work diligently to counter \nthese sea pirates, who have no place in our modern, \ncivilized world.  \n To strengthen the international rules-based \nregime, the Philippines advocates reforming the United \nNations, particularly the Security Council, to make it \nmore resilient, relevant and responsive. The record \nshows that it is only the Philippines that has presented \nspecific drafts resolutions concretely setting forth \nproposals on the five key issues: categories of \nmembership, question of the veto, size of the enlarged \nSecurity Council and working methods, relationship \n \n \n3 11-51687 \n \nbetween the General Assembly and the Security \nCouncil, and the question of regional representation. \n Terrorism continues to cast its dark shadow on all \nof us. The decapitation of terrorist organizations has \nnot put an end to terrorism. We need to address the root \ncauses and conditions that turn individuals with so \nmuch passion into beasts that know nothing but \nviolence to achieve their ends. Among many things, we \nneed to further examine how economic \ndisenfranchisement, intolerance and radicalization \ncontribute to the growth of terrorist groups. \n The rule of law, including the 1982 United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), \nis the key to finding solutions to disputes over \nconflicting claims in the West Philippine Sea. As we \nprepare to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of \nUNCLOS next year, let all States parties remember not \njust our rights, but also our obligations, for the rule of \nlaw is the bedrock on which the growth and \ndevelopment of our community of nations is built. \nAdherence to the rule of law provides stability and \ncertainty in the conduct of relations among States. In a \nworld defined by unequal distribution of economic, \nmilitary and political resources and might, the rule of \nlaw is the great equalizer, ensuring that rights are \nprotected and responsibilities complied with. \nAdherence to the rule of law prevents conflicts. In \ninstances of dispute, particularly of a territorial nature, \nthe rule of law ensures a peaceful settlement and \nresolution. \n The rule of law has guided the Philippines in all \nits actions as a responsible member of the international \ncommunity. The Philippines realizes that only when the \nrule of law prevails can all stakeholders and the world \nbenefit from a region of such importance strategically \nand in terms of resources. We adhere to ASEAN\u2019s 1992 \nManila declaration on the West Philippine Sea and the \n2002 declaration on the conduct of parties in the West \nPhilippine Sea. We call on other parties to do so as \nwell. We also welcome the efforts and support of other \nstakeholders in working towards a lasting, just and \npeaceful solution to the conflicting claims in our \nregion.  \n Allow me to conclude by saying that \nunderpinning the success of all our efforts in the \nUnited Nations is adherence to the rule of law and a \nrules-based international system. Out of the horrors of \nwar, we have resolved as one global community to \nbuild and strengthen the ramparts of peace and \ndevelopment. Those ramparts, strong as they may be, \ncan easily disintegrate when even just one nation \nbehaves contrary to the rules and norms we have all \nagreed to abide by. It is our obligation as individual \nsovereigns States and as a collective global community \nthat all nations, large or small, behave responsibly \nthrough the adherence to the rule of law and a rules-\nbased regime. Only then can we hope to enjoy the \nbenefits of our world and live together in greater peace, \nprogress and prosperity."

        "file_text": "\nI would first like to congratulate Ambassador Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and \nto express our most sincere wishes for his success in \nfulfilling his mandate. Similarly, I would like to \nconvey to Mr. Joseph Deiss Guinea-Bissau\u2019s \nappreciation for the spirit of engagement and \ndedication he brought to his successful conduct of the \nwork of the sixty-fifth session. \n Let me also reiterate my congratulations to the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, \non his recent reappointment, the fruit of the excellent \n  \n \n11-51360 12 \n \nwork he has done to help consolidate peace and \ndevelopment around the world. \n And I would like to take this happy occasion to \nsalute the Republic of South Sudan on having joined \nthe United Nations, becoming the Organization\u2019s most \nrecent full Member. \n Today, 24 September, Guinea-Bissau celebrates \nthe thirty-eighth anniversary of its independence. That \nhistoric achievement was the Guinean people\u2019s first \nmajor victory, and from this rostrum I pay the homage \nthat is owed to our country\u2019s freedom fighters, whose \ncourage and determination enabled us to attain the \nstatus of a free and independent State. \n As our national authorities have stated and has \nbeen unanimously recognized by the international \ncommunity, defence and security sector reforms are \nurgent priorities for us, since their implementation can \nstrengthen peace and stability in our country and thus \ncreate the conditions needed for sustainable \ndevelopment. With the signing of the Tripartite \nAgreement Protocol or Memorandum of Understanding \nbetween the Economic Community of West African \nStates (ECOWAS), the Community of Portuguese-\nspeaking Countries and the Government of Guinea-\nBissau, which will take place at the margins of this \nsession of the Assembly, we will be able to make a \nmajor qualitative leap in the implementation of defence \nand security forces reform, as well as in effectively \nimplementing the programmes contained in the \nECOWAS road map.  \n In that regard, Guinea-Bissau\u2019s commitment to \nmobilizing resources to sustain the reforms has led to a \ndecision to create a special pension fund, into which \nwe will have deposited $200,000 of the $500,000 we \npledged to the fund by December 2011, as proof of our \nfirm commitment to contributing 10 per cent of the \ntotal resources required. We therefore expect to hold a \nhigh-level meeting with our development partners this \nyear, in order to obtain the financial and technical \nresources required to implement the reforms, and we \nappeal to all our partners to participate in and commit \nto the meeting. \n Drug trafficking and organized crime are a \ncurrent subject of discussion in the Organization, and, \nas is well known, the West African region to which we \nbelong cited as a hub and Guinea-Bissau is also often \nsingled out as a transit point for illicit drugs. In full \nawareness of this reality and recognizing our known \nproblems, we are proud to say that we were one of the \nfirst countries to request the good offices of the United \nNations, through the United Nations Office on Drugs \nand Crime (UNODC), to help us deal with the issue \nwith determination and effectiveness. \n In order to combat drug trafficking and organized \ncrime, the Government, through its Council of \nMinisters, has adopted two important instruments, a \npolitical declaration and a plan of action, which \ninclude large-scale actions in the following three areas: \nstrengthening the legal system, strengthening the \ncriminal justice system, and combating drug use and \nHIV/AIDS. Alongside such measures at the national \nlevel, the Government is seeking to sign bilateral \nagreements to strengthen the fight against drug \ntrafficking, keeping in mind that, without strategic \ncooperation between the countries of origin, transit and \nconsumption of drugs, there can be no effective fight \nagainst drug trafficking. \n Therefore, from this rostrum, we reiterate our \nappeal, as we have many times before, for help in \ncontrolling our maritime borders. We address this \nappeal to countries that are better prepared than we are \nto do so. We are making a formal request for the \nsupport of the United States and the European Union \nand its member States, since we cannot single-\nhandedly fight drug trafficking, which, as we all know, \nis increasingly powerful and sophisticated. \n We are approaching the deadline for achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals, but despite \nongoing efforts, Guinea-Bissau continues to face \nchallenges with regard to basic sanitation, supplies of \ndrinking water and energy, and the provision of \nprimary health services, to cite only the most pressing \nissues. The high rate of poverty that still prevails in our \ncountry has forced the Government to adopt an \nambitious agenda for the future, embodied in our \nnational poverty reduction strategy document and \nbased on the pillars of stability, peace, economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction. That document defines \nthe main challenges and recommends priorities for the \nnext five years. As a result of serious and rigorous \nimplementation of this strategy, the Government that I \nhave the honour to lead has already successfully \nreversed this negative trend. \n The current economic situation is clearly \nimproving, the result of progress made in the last two \nand a half years in strengthening public policy and \n \n \n13 11-51360 \n \nimproving macroeconomic performance, as our \npartners, especially the International Monetary Fund \nand the World Bank, will testify. As a result of our \nexcellent macroeconomic performance, the country \nreached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted \nPoor Countries Initiative, thus achieving forgiveness of \nabout 90 per cent of its external debt and the recent \nre-evaluation of the growth rate of its gross domestic \nproduct, which is now fixed at 5.3 per cent, which is \nhigher than originally predicted. We have all the \nconditions needed to maintain and accelerate this trend \nduring the next year. \n To that end, in addition to relying on our own \nresources, which can now be devoted to poverty \nreduction programmes, the Government will organize a \nround table of donors in the first quarter of 2012 to \nmobilize the necessary financial resources for the \nimplementation of those programmes. In that context, \nwe appeal once more for the participation of and \ncontributions by all traditional donors that are \ninterested in our country and that wish to support \nnational efforts aimed at overcoming our current \nweaknesses. \n Let me once again welcome the establishment of \nUN-Women, an entity that reflects the firm \ncommitment of our Organization to the struggle for \ngender equality and to ensuring that women have the \nconditions necessary for a more representative and \nactive participation in the process of transformation \nthat is under way in our societies. \n In the same context, my country is taking \nmeasures to uphold the dignity of women, including \nmeasures to promote their empowerment and the \naffirmation of their autonomy. I welcome the steps \ntaken recently by the Guinean Parliament, which \napproved the criminalization of female genital \nmutilation and increased penalties for trafficking in \nminors. \n Guinea-Bissau\u2019s status and credibility in the \ninternational arena depends largely on its ability to \ndefine and implement a foreign policy that takes into \naccount the great universal values of democracy, \nfreedom and human rights, which are our values as \nwell.  \n In our diplomatic efforts, we have to be \nconsistent with our historical commitments and, above \nall, faithful to all who selflessly helped us in the \nstruggle for the affirmation of our dignity. \n From that perspective, we welcome the decision \nof the Palestinian Authority to submit a request for the \nrecognition of the State of Palestine as a full Member \nof the United Nations. We encourage a constructive \ndialogue on the basis of the possibility of peaceful \ncoexistence and mutually advantageous cooperation \nbetween countries and peoples. \n This session of the Assembly is taking place at a \ntime when major changes are occurring in the Arab \nworld. These changes call for greater political and \nsocial rights, as well as values such as freedom and \ndemocracy, and, for that very reason, the Arabs have \nour sympathy and solidarity. We regret, however, the \ncases where transition incurs high costs in terms of \nhuman lives. \n With regard to Libya, Guinea-Bissau fully \nsupports the position of the African Union and \nexpresses its full readiness to cooperate and to \nstrengthen the increasingly friendly relations and \ncooperation with the legitimate representatives of the \nLibyan people.  \n We urge the United States Government to draw \non the values that define that great nation and to \nresume its relationship with Cuba, ending the embargo \nthat has lasted for more than five decades and freeing \nthe Cubans still being held in its prisons. \n The responsibilities of the United Nations are \nincreasing, and the globalization of the decisions that it \nis called upon to take is becoming increasingly urgent. \n The historical reasons that led to the \nestablishment of the Security Council are no longer \ncurrent. The demographic representation of the \ndifferent regions of the world, the emergence of new \ncountries and new geopolitical configurations oblige us \nto accept as natural the reform of the Security Council. \nWe deem it legitimate to want the decisions of the \nSecurity Council to be made more inclusive and \nparticipatory through giving our continent both \npermanent and non-permanent seats, as is the wish of \nthe African Union, because of the large representation \nof the African continent. \n Under the auspices of the President of the \nRepublic, Mr. Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1, the National \nAssembly launched a process of national reconciliation \ninvolving all the forces of the nation. That important \ninitiative has contributed to the establishment of the \n  \n \n11-51360 14 \n \nclimate of peace and understanding that now prevails \nin the country. \n To conclude, I take this opportunity to thank all \nfriends and partners of Guinea-Bissau for their support \nand solidarity and to assure them that we will spare no \neffort in consolidating peace and building a more just \nsociety to create better living conditions for the \nGuinean people."

        "file_text": "It is an honour \nto address the General Assembly for the first time, and \nit is a particular honour to do so as such momentous \nevents unfold in the Arab world. Last week I was in \nTripoli and Benghazi. I saw the hunger of a people \neager to get on with reclaiming their country, writing \nthemselves a new chapter of freedom and democracy. \nThis has been the most dramatic episode of what has \nbeen called the Arab Spring. \n My argument today is that Libya and the Arab \nSpring show that the United Nations needs a new way \nof working, because the Arab Spring is a massive \nopportunity to spread peace, prosperity, democracy \nand, vitally, security, but only if we really seize the \nopportunity.  \n So the events of this year present a challenge to \nall of us \u2014 a challenge to Europe to show it can reform \nits aid and trade strategy to be truly progressive; a \nchallenge to the African Union, to meet the \nopportunities of this century with the same courage \nthat won liberation in the last; a challenge to the \nIsraelis and Palestinians, to take the bold steps to come \nto the table and make lasting peace; a challenge to Iran \nand to Syria, to give their peoples the freedoms they \ndeserve; and a challenge to the United Nations. \n One can sign every human rights declaration in \nthe world, but if one stands by and watches people \nbeing slaughtered in their own country when one could \n \n \n25 11-50865 \n \nact, then what are those signatures really worth? The \nUnited Nations has to show that we can be not just \nunited in condemnation, but united in action, acting in \na way that lives up to the United Nations founding \nprinciples and meets the needs of peoples everywhere. \n The peoples of the Arab world have made their \naspirations clear. They want transparency and \naccountability of Government, an end to corruption, \nthe fair and consistent rule of law, the chance to get a \njob and to have a stake in how their country is run, the \nfreedom to communicate and the chance to participate \nin shaping society as citizens with rights and \nresponsibilities. \n No one says that achieving those ambitions will \nbe easy. There will be false starts and wrong turns \nalong the way, not least where countries have inherited \nsectarian and regional divisions, weak political parties, \nState institutions enfeebled by misuse and a politics \ndistorted by the false choice between repression on the \none hand and Islamist extremism on the other. \n The long process of developing a new and \naccountable Government is just beginning. And across \nthe region, we cannot guarantee that the process of \nreform is irreversible. But let us be clear. These \ndevelopments present a great opportunity for many \nwho have long been sold short by their Governments, \nand there is an opportunity and responsibility for all of \nus, too. \n Just as after 1989 we helped those who tore down \nthe Berlin Wall to build robust democracies and market \neconomies, just as in 1994 we welcomed South Africa \nback into the commonwealth of nations when it chose \nthe path of reconciliation and democracy instead of \nracial conflict, so now in 2011, as people in North \nAfrica and the Middle East stand up and give voice to \ntheir hopes for more open and democratic societies, we \nhave an opportunity, and, I would say, a responsibility \nto help them. \n Now the mistake we often make in the West is to \nthink that because the people in this region want \ndemocracy, they will want it in the same way and with \nthe same outcomes that we do. We should not be trying \nto impose Western values or a single template on the \nregion. Democracy is a process, not an event. \nParticipatory Government involves so much more than \njust the simple act of voting. The Assembly heard not \nlong ago from President Ahmadinejad. He did not \nremind us that he runs a country where they may have \nelections, of a sort, but they also repress freedom of \nspeech. They do everything they can to avoid the \naccountability of a free media. They violently prevent \ndemonstrations. And yes, they detain and torture those \nwho argue for a better future. So we should never \npretend that having elections is enough. The building \nblocks of democracy have to be patiently developed \nfrom the grass roots up. The process will be different in \nevery country. And it is not for us to dictate how Arab \nnations should respond to those challenges, or to \nlecture them about how to do it. But there is an \nimportant opportunity for us to help, and we must seize \nit.  \n There are important lessons from what has \nhappened in Libya. The Libyans liberated themselves. \nOrdinary Libyans from all walks of life came together \nand showed incredible resilience and bravery as they \nrose up and drove out Al-Qadhafi. The people of \nBenghazi, the brave fighters of Misurata, the people of \nZawiyah, the warriors from the Nafusa Mountains, all \nof them showed incredible courage in liberating their \ncountry. The National Transitional Council, which \ndemonstrated great leadership, not least as Tripoli fell, \nurged people to avoid reprisals and to look to the \nfuture \u2014 a message that still holds true today.  \n That revolution truly belongs to the Libyan \npeople. The United Nations played a vital role \nauthorizing international action. But let us be clear; the \nUnited Nations is no more effective than the nation \nStates that come together to enforce its will. And on \nthis occasion a coalition of nations across the Western \nand Arab world had the will to act. In doing so, they \nstopped Benghazi from joining Srebrenica and Rwanda \nin history\u2019s painful roll call of massacres that the world \nfailed to prevent. Today, Tripoli and Benghazi are \ncities transformed. Where there was fear, now there is \nhope and an optimism and belief that are truly \ninspiring.  \n But there are challenges ahead, not just in Libya \nbut all across the region. Economies in the region have \nunderperformed when compared with their peers. In \n1960, Egypt\u2019s gross domestic product per capita was \ncomparable with Korea\u2019s. Today it has fallen to around \njust one fifth of the size. Across the region, some \ncountries dependent on oil revenues, and others held \nback by heavy State control have failed to diversify \nand create jobs in productive new sectors and failed to \nconnect themselves to the economies of the region and \nthe wider world.  \n  \n \n11-50865 26 \n \n Indeed, less than four per cent of North African \ntrade is within the region, making it the least integrated \nneighbourhood in our world. And the promise of \neconomic reform has not been fulfilled. Too often \npeople were told economic reform would bring them \nmarket economies with greater freedom to start up \nbusinesses, to trade, to grow and to create wealth. But \nit did not. It brought them corrupt and crony \ncapitalism. Now the future is for the people of this \nregion to determine, but I would urge them not to reject \nsomething they have never had \u2014 a genuine, open, fair \nand transparent market economy, which has proved the \nworld over to be the best way to create jobs and \nwealth. And the need for economic success is vital, \nbecause this is a region where 60 per cent of the \npopulation is under 25, and youth unemployment is \nnearly double the world average. \n It is a region that must create 50 million new jobs \nby 2020 just to keep pace with its population; that \nmeans 700,000 new jobs every year in Egypt alone. \nAnd these jobs should not be just for men. Let us be \nhonest. It is not just the men of the region who want a \njob and a voice. The unemployment rate for Egyptian \nwomen is more than three times that of men. And it is \nnot only the economy where they are denied the chance \nto play a fuller role. It is society and politics and \nculture too. But look at the crowds in Freedom Square \nand we see it is the women too, finding their voices, \nshowing clearly that they want to play a part in \nbuilding their future. \n So, in this historic period, when the voice of this \nregion is finally being heard, there is now a unique \nopportunity for women to fulfil their ambitions too. \nThis is not just in the interests of women. It is in the \ninterests of those countries as a whole. Let us be clear. \nYou cannot build strong economies, open societies and \ninclusive political systems if you lock out women. So \nthe Arab Spring will not succeed if the opportunities \nthat are opening up are denied to half of the \npopulation.  \n Now, of course, the actions we take to support the \npeople in each country must be tailored to that country, \nwith respect for its particular culture, history and \ntradition. What is right for Libya will not necessarily \nbe right for everywhere else. But the international \ncommunity has found its voice in Libya, and we must \nnot now lose our nerve. We must have the confidence \nto speak out and act as necessary to support those who \nseek new freedoms.  \n In the European Union, it is time to ensure that \nthe billions of euros we spend in this region each year \nare used to support reform that will meet the \naspirations of the people. And there should be no more \nexcuses for denying the people of the region fair access \nto our markets, including in agriculture. Here at the \nUnited Nations, we have a responsibility to stand up \nagainst regimes that persecute their people. We need to \nsee reform in Yemen. And above all, on Syria, it is time \nfor the members of the Security Council to act. We \nmust now adopt a credible resolution, threatening \ntough sanctions. \n Of course we should always act with care when it \ncomes to the internal affairs of a sovereign State. But \nwe cannot allow this to be an excuse for indifference in \nthe face of a regime that, week after week, arrests, \nintimidates, tortures and kills people who are \npeacefully trying to make their voices heard.  \n The voice of the African Union is vital too. Africa \nhas rightly challenged the world to meet its aid \ncommitments. I am proud that Britain will meet its \ncommitment to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national \nincome from 2013. And all the countries that made \npromises at Gleneagles and elsewhere must meet those \npromises too. In the case of Britain, it means we have \nbeen able to provide \u00a3124 million of emergency aid to \n3 million people facing starvation in the Horn of \nAfrica. But at the same time, Africa must meet its \nresponsibilities too.  \n Many will find it hard to understand why \ncountries in southern Africa which fought so hard to \nthrow off oppression themselves, have been so slow to \nrespond to the Arab Spring. Of course, I recognize that \nmany have long been committed to non-intervention. \nBut my argument is that where action is necessary, \nlegal and right, to fail to act is to fail those who need \nour help. So it is welcome that the African Union is \ntaking steps to recognize the National Transitional \nCouncil in Libya, as many African countries have \nalready done. Africa\u2019s responsibility now is to embrace \nand support Libya\u2019s new, inclusive and democratic \nfuture. And this must include ensuring that those \nwanted for serious crimes are brought to justice, and \nthat the wealth stolen from the Libyan people is \nreturned to them.  \n We all have a responsibility to the Palestinians \ntoo. A key part of the Arab Spring is the right of \nPalestinians to have a viable State of their own, living \n \n \n27 11-50865 \n \nin peace, alongside a safe and secure State of Israel. \nAnd I strongly support this. There has been much \nspeculation about what will happen here this week. Let \nus be clear about one fact. No resolution can, on its \nown, substitute for the political will necessary to bring \npeace. Peace will only come when Palestinians and \nIsraelis sit down and talk to each other, make \ncompromises, build trust and agree. So our role must \nbe to support this, to defeat those who embrace \nviolence, to stop the growth of settlements and to \nsupport Palestinians and Israelis alike to make peace.  \n But the opportunity in Libya and elsewhere in the \nregion is not just about achieving a more open society, \nprosperity and the building blocks of democracy for \ntheir own sake \u2014 it is about security too. Some have \nargued that stability in the Arab world can only be \nachieved by the tight control of strong authoritarian \nregimes and that reform is a threat to stability. In fact, \nthe opposite is true. Reform is the basis of long-term \nstability. Authoritarianism threatens it.  \n While there is never a justification for resorting \nto terror, if people\u2019s hunger for a job and a voice are \ndenied, there is a real risk that the frustration and the \nalienation they feel will cause them to be drawn to \nmore violent and extremist responses. That is not just a \nproblem for one region. It is a problem for all of us. \nHere, in this great city, where 10 years ago, people of \n90 different nationalities were killed in the most \nhorrific terrorist attack in history, we must recognize \nthat political and economic reform in the Middle East \nis not just good in its own right, but that it is also a key \npart of how, in the end, we will defeat Al-Qaida.  \n Of course, we must meet terrorist activity with a \nstrong and resolute security response. Al-Qaida and its \noffshoots must know that they will have no safe hiding \nplace to plot or recruit young men to train as terrorists. \nBut in the long term, we must defeat not only the \nterrorists, but the extremist ideology that feeds them. \nAl-Qaida\u2019s poisonous ideology has thrived on \nrepression. Democracy is what it fears most. People are \nnot in Tahrir Square in Cairo and Freedom Square in \nLibya for an Islamist caliphate, but for a job, a voice \nand a future. And we must heed their call, for their \nfreedom and for the security of us all."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \npraising His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdelaziz \nAl-Nasser for his steady stewardship as the President \nof the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In \nhis work he can count on the constructive engagement \nof the Bulgarian delegation. Allow me also personally \nto praise him for the theme he has chosen for this \nsession. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his \n  \n \n11-51197 18 \n \noutstanding leadership of the previous session\u2019s busy \nagenda. Last but not least, let me congratulate the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his \nreappointment to the helm of the United Nations. He \nhas proven himself to be a diligent, hard-working \nleader who believes strongly in consensus and \nharmony, qualities that the United Nations needs now \nin its top administrator and will undoubtedly need even \nmore in years to come. \n I begin by welcoming the work of delegations at the \nUnited Nations High-level Meeting on non-communicable \ndiseases. Cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic \nrespiratory diseases and diabetes are now responsible \nfor more deaths than all other causes combined. \nBulgaria welcomes the negotiated final document. \nMore than 80 per cent of cardiovascular and diabetes \ndeaths, almost 90 per cent of deaths from chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease and more than two \nthirds of all cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-\nincome countries. Bulgaria also particularly welcomes \nthe High-level Meeting on nuclear safety and security. \nThe effects of nuclear accidents have no respect for \nnational borders. To adequately safeguard our people \nwe must have firm international consensus and action, \nas well as agreement on stringent international safety \nstandards.  \n Today we stand on the doorstep of historic \nchange in the Middle East, the scale of which can only \nbe compared to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \nsweeping transformation of Central and Eastern Europe \nafter the end of communism. Both processes are quite \ndifferent but share a fundamental similarity \u2014 people \nhave come out of the bondage of fear. Although the \ncircumstances in each country are different, the root \ncauses for what is happening in the Middle East are \nquite similar. Corrupt leadership breeds dissent, and \nwith no democratic process in place, that dissent pours \nout on to the streets. Young people want to be engaged \nin the future of their countries, not forced into a world \nof virtual reality by frowning aging dictators. Millions \nof people who live on the brink of poverty and see a \nprivileged few reap the benefits of economic freedom \nwill demand fair economic opportunities for all. \n Add to that the feeling of revival and the demand \nof millions of young Arabs to be respected, and you \nhave the makings of a revolution of Arab dignity and \nself-respect, an historic revolution indeed. As change \nswept across the Middle East and North Africa, some \nleaders cringed in fear, others embraced it. Those who \nopposed their people are no longer in positions of \npower, and their countries are moving on and looking \nto democratic elections. Those who embraced change \nhave initiated far-reaching reforms and responded to \nthe legitimate demands of their people. His Majesty \nKing Abdullah II of Jordan and His Majesty King \nMohammed VI of Morocco should to be commended \nfor their vision and willingness to reform. They have \nshown the way forward.  \n At the same time, the international community \nhas been appalled by the developments in Syria. \nInstead of responding to the legitimate demands of the \nSyrian people for the fulfilment of promised reforms, \nthe Government cracked down violently on protesters. \nThe protesters did not have unrealistic demands. They \ndid not ask for anything out of the ordinary. According \nto the United Nations more than 2,600 people have \nbeen killed since March. The Government in Damascus \nquestions those numbers. Even if only one person had \nbeen killed, it would have been one person too many.  \n The responsibility for repression lies squarely \nwith the authorities and no one else. I use this \nopportunity to call on President Al-Assad, who has \nmade many promises to his people and the \ninternational community, to come out from the \nshadows, change the Constitution, dismantle the \nmachinery of repression and immediately call for \ninternationally supervised elections. The people of \nSyria have the right to elect their own Government and \nhold it accountable. The time for transition has come. \n At this session we welcomed the 193rd Member \nof the United Nations. Our hearts go out to the people \nof South Sudan, who have struggled for independence, \nand we commend the visionary leadership of their \nGovernment for paving the way for their independence \nin a peaceful manner. We also welcomed the new \nrepresentatives of a free Libya, free from the \noppression of the Al-Qadhafi dictatorship. It was at the \ngates of Benghazi in February that the international \ncommunity, acting on a mandate of the United Nations \nSecurity Council, acted swiftly to prevent a massacre \nand protect civilians against attacks from their own \nGovernment.  \n The people of Libya proved that they could stand \nup and defend their right to freedom. Our thoughts go \nout to the families of all those who lost their lives in \nthis struggle and fell victim to the crazed ambitions of \na deluded dictator. Bulgaria stands ready to assist the \n \n \n19 11-51197 \n \npeople of Libya in rebuilding their country. Our \nfriendship is strong and has been tested through the \nyears.  \n We know at first hand the brutality that \nAl-Qadhafi was capable of. The five Bulgarian nurses \nand a doctor who spent eight years of their lives in a \nLibyan jail, much of it on death row, are still haunted \nby their tortures. Let me quote one of them who \nrecently said in an interview, \u201cWe died every time the \ncell door opened.\u201d Now safely back home, they need to \nbe able to close that chapter of their nightmares. Like \nthe nurses, innocent victims of a brutal dictatorship, \nthe Libyan people do want to see justice, not revenge. \nSuch justice will be sought when the dictator and his \ncronies are brought before a court of law. \n No matter how successful we are individually we \ncannot truly enjoy the fruits of our own development if \nwe live in an insecure environment. Regional \ncooperation and good-neighbourly relations are vital \nfor the well-being of our countries and our societies. \nLet me turn briefly to the Balkans.  \n The European Union was created to make war \nimpossible in a continent that has seen at least a \ncentury of conflicts. Europe will not be whole and \ncomplete until our neighbours in the Balkans are part \nof our Union. It falls to us to say it loud and clear: to \nmake war impossible in the Balkans we must see all \ncountries that have emerged from the former \nYugoslavia as part of the European Union. That is our \nhistoric mission. It is our destiny. That is why we will \ncontinue to work tirelessly to remove the obstacles to \nEuropean Union enlargement in the Balkans, to \nstrengthen regional cooperation and develop good-\nneighbourly relations in a region that has seen too \nmuch division and violence.  \n With particular vigour, we will continue to \nencourage the European Union-facilitated dialogue \nbetween Belgrade and Pristina. Bulgaria welcomes the \npragmatic approach taken by both Kosovo and Serbia \nduring their first meetings. It is important that they \nbuild on this momentum and continue to engage in a \nconstructive and pragmatic manner. All must show \nrestraint and prevent the build-up of tension. That is \nvital for the security, prosperity and, ultimately, the \nEuropean perspective of the region. \n Bulgaria is a country that has a proud and \nturbulent history. Our history teaches us that nations \nare strong when their civic spirit is strong. It teaches us \nthat you must find pride not only in great historic \nbattles and ancient legends but in great feats of civic \nactivism, in standing up for your values and protecting \nyour neighbours. One such inspiring example is the \nfact that the Jews of Bulgaria survived the Second \nWorld War because hundreds of religious and \ncommunity leaders, politicians, ordinary men and \nwomen, stood up and refused to be part of Hitler\u2019s \nmadness. My country today is the product of the \ntraditions of Christians, Jews and Muslims, who all \nform the fabric of the Bulgarian nation. That is our \nrichness and makes us quite unique in the Balkans. \nThat is why we cannot remain uninterested in \ndevelopments in the Middle East, particularly with \nregard to the elusive prospects for peace between the \npeople of Israel and the people of Palestine. \n Over the course of the past year, we have seen the \ntireless efforts of the United States Administration and \nthe European Union High Representative for Foreign \nAffairs and Security Policy, Mrs. Catherine Ashton, \ntrying to find a way to resume direct negotiations. \nThose efforts, including the agreed Quartet statement \nof today, need to be applauded, encouraged and \nsupported by all. It was in the United Nations in 1947 \nthat the State of Israel was born. It was born as a home \nfor the Jewish people, a beacon of hope for a \ncommunity that had been persecuted and oppressed for \nthousands of years. Today, the landscape is changing. \nSlowly but surely the region is moving towards \ndemocracy. Democracy, accountable government and \nthe rule of law are ultimately in the long-term interests \nof all, Jews and Muslims, Arabs and Israelis. \n The Palestinian people have a right to a State of \ntheir own. Indeed we, the international community, \nhave an obligation to support the establishment of a \nviable and democratic Palestinian State in the West \nBank and Gaza: a Palestine that lives side-by-side with \nthe State of Israel, a Palestine that lives in security and \nmutual recognition with the State of Israel, a Palestine \nthat has secure borders based on the 1967 lines with \nmutually agreed land swaps.  \n Both Palestine, as the home of the Palestinian \npeople, and Israel, as the home of the Jewish people, \nmust guarantee that all ethnic and religious groups \nhave full rights and protection under law. Let me also \nmake one point very clear. To refuse the right of Israel \nto exist means to refuse the right of the Palestinian \npeople to have a State of their own. I can accept \ncriticism of the policies of any Government but I \n  \n \n11-51197 20 \n \ncannot stand idly by when the right of existence is \ndenied to anyone, no matter what their religion or \nethnicity is. To dismiss the importance of such policies \nwould mean to fail the very values of our civilization. \nBulgaria will never accept that, nor should any other \nnation in the global community. \n Bulgaria believes very strongly that the definitive \nsolution to peace can only come through direct \nnegotiations, but direct negotiations can resume only \non the basis of trust and a real understanding of the \nsecurity concerns and legitimate aspirations of both \nsides. Rebuilding trust between both parties is a \nprerequisite to resuming negotiations. Unilateral \naction, changing the realities on the ground cannot be a \nsubstitute for negotiations.  \n Obstacles should be overcome, and preconditions \nshould be removed. If the leaders of Palestine believe \nthat the settlement policy is an obstacle to peace, the \nleaders of Israel must refrain from such activities in \norder to give peace a chance. If the leaders of Israel \nbelieve that no preconditions to a final settlement \nshould be put in place, then the Palestinian leaders \nmust refrain from such actions to give peace a chance.  \n Bulgaria recognized the Palestinian State in 1988. \nWe hold our friendship with both Israel and the \nPalestinian people dear. That is why we urge the \nimmediate resumption of negotiations as the only road \nto peace. Bringing both sides to the negotiating table \nremains our top priority. I am sure that the United \nStates, working in concert with the European Union, \ncan facilitate this process based on a vision outlined by \nPresident Obama. \n Allow me to turn briefly to my delegation\u2019s \nvision for the kind of leadership, the kind of United \nNations we need for the next decade. An Organization \ncreated by 51 Member States functions today with \n193 Members. \n In order for the United Nations to be adequate to \nthe challenges facing it today its institutions need to be \nreformed, first and foremost in the composition of the \nUnited Nations main body that guarantees international \npeace and security. We must build on the progress \nachieved so far in the negotiations on Security Council \nreform and move the process to a more results-oriented \nphase. Bulgaria considers that enlargement of the Council\u2019s \ntwo categories of permanent and non-permanent members \nis one option that enjoys the support of a considerable \nnumber of delegations. The increase in the number of \nnon-permanent seats should provide for a just \nrepresentation of the Eastern European Group, whose \nmembership has more than doubled over the past two \ndecades. \n Transparency is impossible without \naccountability. First, the United Nations must be \naccountable to its Member States through a continued \nstriving to improve management and the enforcement \nof strict budgetary discipline, especially in the current \nperiod of economic turmoil. We, the Member States, \nmust also be accountable to the United Nations by \nfulfilling all our commitments, including by paying our \nfinancial contributions to the Organization fully, \nunconditionally and on time \u2014 a principle that \nBulgaria upholds and adheres to closely. \n We all also need to be accountable to future \ngenerations for our actions. It is easy to speak of \nsustainable development, but at the moment we are not \neven remotely close to making it a reality. On the \ncontrary, the damage we have done to the planet\u2019s \ngeology, climate and ecosystems for most of the last \ncentury is so significant that scientists are increasingly \nasserting that the human race has actually managed to \npush the Earth much faster than usual into a new, \npossibly more unstable and dangerous geological \nperiod. \n We need both wise and courageous leadership \nfrom the United Nations in our efforts to guarantee \npeace and security \u2014 wise, so as to avoid the \ntemptation to use force when it seems to get results \nfaster than mediation and negotiation, and courageous, \nto take responsibility when the use of force is a must. \nThe United Nations will benefit much from \nstrengthening its cooperation with regional security \norganizations. The cooperation with the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization in Afghanistan is an excellent \nexample. International support has to continue beyond \n2014 for Afghanistan. We were all saddened by the \nbrutal murder of a great Afghan leader, former \nPresident Rabbani. His work must inspire us to \ncontinue supporting the Afghan Government\u2019s efforts \nto achieve reconciliation and reintegration.  \n It is high time for bold and decisive actions in the \nfield of disarmament and non-proliferation as well. It is \nthe legal and moral obligation of all of us to honour the \ncommitments undertaken under the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the \noutcome document of the 2010 Review Conference. A \n \n \n21 11-51197 \n \nstrengthened and robust NPT regime is in the interest \nof all States, especially with the growing risk of \nnon-State actors getting access to weapons of mass \ndestruction. All States Parties, including the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea are bound by \nthe NPT regime. Leaving the NPT should not be \nwithout consequences. Cooperation with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is also \nessential. As long as Iran continues not to provide \ngreater transparency with regard to of its nuclear \nactivities, the concerns of the international community \nwill remain valid. Full compliance with Security \nCouncil resolutions and with the provisions of the \nIAEA safeguards agreement is crucial for a diplomatic \nsolution of this case. \n The sad anniversary of the 11 September 2001 \nattacks in New York, which we commemorated this \nyear, the more recent tragic events in Oslo, the terrorist \nattacks in Mumbai and other cities of the world prove \nthat terrorism is a global cancer that does not  \n \ndiscriminate against developed or developing countries \nand societies. Its eradication requires decisive action. \nThe successful conclusion of the negotiations on the \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \nhas Bulgaria\u2019s full support.  \n I began my statement by focusing on the \nchallenge of tackling non-communicable diseases. \nHuman suffering caused by various illnesses is further \nexacerbated owing to the effects of the series of global \ncrises in food, finance and energy and the threats \nassociated with climate change. Taken together, these \nand other new challenges impede progress towards the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \nWe must be twice as vigilant as we have been until \nnow. Our world today faces challenges that will shape \nits tomorrow. We need to be able to meet these \nchallenges in a bold manner, with a clear vision for the \nfuture, and tackle them together as a global community \nof nations."

        "file_text": "In June 2009, humankind was still witnessing \nwith perplexity the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression and its devastating consequences on \nemployment, hunger, poverty, trade, foreign direct \ninvestment, credit, tourism, remittances and health and \neducation. At that time, my country, Ecuador, felt a \nmoral obligation to participate, through its head of \nState, in the United Nations Conference on the World \nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \nDevelopment, convened by the then-President of the \nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann. \n  \n \n11-51681 28 \n \n On that occasion, the President of the Republic of \nEcuador emphasized that the global financial debacle, \nwhich, it goes without saying, originated in the main \nfinancial markets of the North, was a symptom of crisis \nin a system in which the speculative-financial economy \ntook precedence over the real economy. In other words, \nthat system entailed waiting for money to create more \nmoney and stability of its own accord, instead of \nstimulating the production of goods and services to \nmeet the needs of human beings. \n For Ecuador, the gravity of the crisis alone should \nhave marked a shift towards a stronger role for the \nUnited Nations in global economic governance, with a \nview to overhauling the international financial system \nand democratizing international relations by \nestablishing a new world economic order. \n Unfortunately, with the exception of a scant few \ncosmetic changes in the governance of the Bretton \nWoods institutions, the paradoxical multi-million-\ndollar bailout of the some of the sectors responsible for \nthe crisis and a fragile mechanism to follow up on the \ncommitments contained in the Outcome of the 2009 \nConference (resolution 63/303, annex), nothing has \nchanged. The world continues to await some sign of \nfinancial and monetary regulation and coordination \nthat would ensure economic stability, access to credit, \nfull and productive employment, trade financing, debt \nsustainability, social safety nets and, of course, a true \nglobal alliance that would protect and promote \ndevelopment to benefit our people, which is the sole \nobjective of our efforts. \n In its current state, the United Nations has been \nunable to rise to the challenges stemming from global \neconomic instability, which have been exacerbated by \nthis new stage in the 2009 financial crisis. That is why \nEcuador is aggressively and resolutely promoting the \ncreation of a new regional financial architecture \ncapable of mitigating the adverse consequences \naffecting our economies as a result of their \ninvolvement in the international financial system. \n In that regard, and without abandoning the \npursuit of comprehensive reforms of the global \nfinancial and economic system, my country has \nsuggested an approach, while taking into account the \npolitical, economic and social circumstances of each \nregion, involving the adoption of regional monetary \nagreements that include a semi-flexible exchange rate \nregime and a common reserve fund so as to create a \ntruly regional exchange rate regime and a regional \ncurrency. \n In the case of Latin America, this proposal had its \norigins in Latin American forums through the creation \nof the Bank of the South. Its main aim is to fund \nmultinational development projects and to bolster local \nand regional currencies linked to a common reserve \nfund for Latin America, which would enable us to deal \nwith the crisis and prevent billions of dollars from our \nregion being paradoxically deposited into the banks of \ndeveloped countries. In the same way, this fund is \ncomplemented by a regional payment system, which \nhas started to work through the Unified Regional \nPayment Clearing System, with excellent results to \ndate. This system is leading the way towards a \ncommon physical currency in our region. \n These regional initiatives can, and should be, \nintegrated into a regional integration framework that \nextends beyond the economic and financial spheres. \nSuch is the case with the Union of South American \nNations, the headquarters and secretariat of which is \nlocated in our capital, Quito, the Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States and the Bolivarian \nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America \u2014 Peoples\u2019 \nTrade Agreement. My country stresses that these \nregional responses should be considered as \ncomplementing the urgent global measures required for \nbetter understanding and cooperation among regions.  \n At the same time, Ecuador urgently calls for a \ncomprehensive reform of the world economic and \nfinancial system, including measures such as the \ncreation of an economic coordination council and an \nindependent mechanism to restructure and solve the \nproblem of sovereign debt, which, among other \nproposals, should be discussed in a follow-up meeting \nto the 2009 conference. \n However, apart from the economic and financial \ncrisis, the crisis of multilateralism has also been \nreflected in the lack of a timely and suitable response \nby the United Nations to the political crises that have \noccurred, in particular in the Middle East. These have \nonce again demonstrated the urgent need to conclude \nthe long-delayed process of a comprehensive reform of \nthe Security Council. This reform of one of the main \norgans of the United Nations should be primarily \naimed at democratizing its decision-making \nmechanisms, guaranteeing full respect for the principle \nof equitable geographic distribution, including regional \n \n \n29 11-51681 \n \nrepresentation, improving the Council\u2019s working \nmethods and strengthening the relationship between the \nCouncil and the General Assembly. All of this would \nprovide the Council with the necessary legitimacy, \neffectiveness and representativeness to implement its \nmandates. \n At the sixty-fifth session, Ecuador took over the \nchairmanship of the Special Committee on \nDecolonization with the conviction that, starting in \n2011, which marked the beginning of the third \nInternational Decade for the Eradication of \nColonialism, we need new strategies that will lead, in \nthe near future, to the decolonization of those \nterritories that are still on the Committee\u2019s list.  \n Ecuador recognizes that peaceful means of \nsolving disputes are the only legitimate mechanisms \ncapable of guaranteeing sustainable and lasting peace \nfor peoples. Among these is mediation, the central \ntheme proposed by the President of the Assembly for \nthe sixty-sixth session. Imposing solutions by force \nwill never perpetuate peace \u2014 quite the opposite. We \nhave witnessed the failure of these methods, which \nleads to war. We have suffered the failure of these \nwars. My country condemns abusive interpretations of \nSecurity Council resolutions, which systematically lead \nto more violence, bloodshed and human rights \nviolations and which do not foster friendly relations \namong countries.  \n Ecuador\u2019s position with regard to the Middle East \nhas as its founding principle our full adherence to the \nstandards and principles of international law and strict \ncompliance with United Nations resolutions. Forty-\nthree years after having accepted the partition of \nPalestine into two States, on 24 December 2010 the \nGovernment of Ecuador, in a gesture of historic justice, \nrecognized Palestine as a free and independent State, \nwithin its 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its \ncapital. My country therefore gave its full support to \naccepting Palestine\u2019s request to become a full State \nMember of the United Nations, as formally requested \nby the Palestinian President a few days ago. We also \nsupport all initiatives directed towards consolidating \nlasting peace, to benefit not only Palestine and Israel, \nbut the entire region. This is a historic time for the \nUnited Nations, and Ecuador hopes that the \nOrganization will rise to the occasion. \n Concerning our region, Ecuador once again \nfirmly condemns the economic, trade and financial \nblockade imposed by the United States of America \nagainst Cuba and demands the immediate and \nunconditional lifting of all unilateral measures imposed \nin an extraterritorial fashion by that country against our \nsister Caribbean nation. The blockade has inflicted \nserious economic, social and even humanitarian \nsuffering on the population. \n With regard to the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development to be held in Rio de Janeiro, \n20 years after the adoption of the international \nprinciples and instruments that set a new course for \ninternational relations, we are now reaching a \nwatershed moment. Through it, we will be able to take \nstock of the implementation, both in the past and over \nthe coming decades, of these principles and \ninstruments. This would enable renewed political \ncommitment to sustainable development, which will \nrequire action on the three pillars, which we define as \nthe economic, social and environmental areas.  \n In order to implement the elements pending from \nthe Rio conventions, Ecuador believes that we should, \nfirst, comply with commitments to reduce greenhouse \ngases in order to stabilize the temperature at levels that \nwill enable us to restore balance to the planet while \nupholding the principle of shared but differentiated \nresponsibilities and equity; secondly, insist on the \ntransfer of the new and additional financial resources \npromised by developed countries, considering the huge \nefforts that we developing countries are making in \nfacing global threats; thirdly, remember that \nsustainability is not just an environmental question, but \na shift in the relationships between capital, labour, \nnature and politics; fourthly, fix terms for technology \ntransfers that will enable developing countries to make \nprogress in capacity-building and in finding options in \ntheir pursuit of sustainable development; and fifthly, \ndraft international instruments in the field of \nsustainable development in order to achieve equality, \nnot just with regard to a green economy or a \nstrengthened institutional framework, but also in order \nto include development in the comprehensive approach \nto improving quality of life, with adequate links \nbetween the three pillars to which I have referred \u2014 \nwhat we in Ecuador call \u201cliving well\u201d. \n Four years ago, here in the Hall, my country \nmade an unequivocal gesture of its commitment to the \nfight against the global challenge of climate change \nand the promotion of sustainable development. Indeed, \nin 2007, Ecuador presented to the world the forward-\n  \n \n11-51681 30 \n \nlooking Yasun\u00ed ITT initiative, an innovative and \nrevolutionary idea. Under the initiative, the State of \nEcuador committed to leaving 856 million barrels of \noil underground indefinitely under the Yasun\u00ed National \nPark, thereby preventing the emission of 407 million \nmetric tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere \nthat would have been produced by the burning of these \nfossil fuels. All this was conceived as a swap in \ncompensation for the estimated value of 50 per cent of \nthe revenue that the exploitation of those resources \nwould generate.  \n The Yasun\u00ed-ITT initiative, known today \nthroughout the world, represents a concrete, effective \nmeasure for combating climate change and preserving \nthe rich biodiversity of the area, along with its water, \nthe rights of indigenous people living in the park and \nnature itself. By foregoing the right to exploit the oil \nreserves that lie beneath the Yasun\u00ed National Park and \nthe economic resources that would be required to \ndevelop them, Ecuador hopes that the international \ncommunity will contribute at least half of what the \ncountry would have received in profit, acting under the \nprinciple of co-responsibility on the part of countries \nthat have historically been most responsible for climate \nchange. \n In a parallel event that took place here at the \nUnited Nations on 23 September with the support of \nthe Secretary-General and the President, President \nRafael Correa reminded the international community \nabout the Yasun\u00ed-ITT initiative. The proposal has been \nenthusiastically received by countries, organizations, \ncitizens, visionaries and leaders from around the world, \nadding up to significant support from both individuals \nand the private sector. That response has allowed \nEcuador to broaden its initiative in a manner that will \ntransform the governance of public resources at the \nglobal level. For example, we have begun to shape the \nconcept of net avoided emissions, which President \nCorrea introduced last year at the Canc\u00fan Climate \nChange Conference. That and the Yasun\u00ed-ITT initiative \nare two visionary proposals from a developing oil-\nproducing nation of the South as a contribution to \nglobal challenges in the area of sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n Throughout this session, Ecuador will continue to \ndefend with particular emphasis the right to \ndevelopment, the human right to water, the rights of \nindigenous peoples, the rights of women, girls and \nboys, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of \nolder adult men and women, the rights of migrant \nworkers and their families and the rights of all \nvulnerable members of society.  \n For this reason, my country reiterates its concern \nabout, and rejects, legislation adopted by certain States \nwhose application leads to measures or practices that \nrestrict the full exercise of migrant workers\u2019 human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. By the same token, \nwe reaffirm that even as they exercise their sovereign \nright to implement such measures to control their \nborders, States have the obligation to guarantee the \nhuman rights of migrant workers and should promote \nmeasures that favour family unification and the \nprotection of minors. States also have the responsibility \nto strengthen laws that punish any act of violence \nagainst migrant workers, particularly hate crimes that \nfoment discrimination based on ethnic, racial or \nreligious differences, as well as crimes against migrant \nworkers that are committed with racist or xenophobic \nmotives. \n Ecuador is a peaceful land that espouses universal \ndisarmament and condemns the development and use \nof weapons of mass destruction. For that reason, we \nplace great importance on disarmament and \ninternational security, and note with concern the \nshrinking space for enforcing agreements in those \nareas. \n The international community has not produced a \nsingle instrument through which the nuclear States \npledge to refrain from using nuclear weapons against \nnon-nuclear countries during the process aimed at \ndestroying all such arms. It would seem that within the \nConference on Disarmament the only interest and \nconcern is to advance within the framework of nuclear \nproliferation, downgrading or, even worse, \nmarginalizing all possibility of progress in the realm of \nnuclear disarmament. For that reason, my country \nsupports the ongoing negotiation process within the \nConference on Disarmament, which includes all \npending matters. \n As a proponent of universal disarmament, peace \nand sustainable development in harmony with nature, \nand as a signatory to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which \nestablished the world\u2019s first nuclear-free region, \nEcuador sincerely hopes that the pending aspects \nregarding the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in \nthe Middle East will be resolved. \n \n \n31 11-51681 \n \n My country wishes to express its full support for \ninitiatives aimed at establishing transparency in the \narea of conventional weapons and for combating illegal \ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons, including \nlandmines and cluster bombs. We also support \nmeasures taken within the context of the Programme of \nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We look \nforward to the United Nations Conference on the Arms \nTrade Treaty, whose outcome document should be an \nobjective, predictable and non-discriminatory \ninstrument. \n Since 1953, Ecuador has been part of the great \nUnited Nations undertaking to maintain peace and \nsecurity across the world. We have increasingly \ncontributed to United Nations armed forces for \npeacekeeping missions in various countries. We are \ncurrently participating in Haiti, Chad, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, \nLiberia, the Central African Republic and the Sudan. \n Since 2004, we have participated in the United \nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti as part of the \nChilean-Ecuadoran company of engineers that is \nhelping to build new infrastructure for that country\u2019s \ndevelopment, with due recognition from the authorities \nand the local populace. \n Ecuador foresees increasing its participation in \npeacekeeping operations, but our intentions go beyond \nthat. As a troop-contributing country, we wish to \nincrease the number of units and armed forces \npersonnel taking part in such operations. We have \nmade great efforts to show our commitment to joining \nthe international community in its struggle to ensure \nthat regions experiencing the greatest upheaval can \nresolve their differences and achieve the peace that is \nso necessary.  \n Let us not be deceived \u2014 global multilateralism \nis in deep crisis. The United Nations system has not \nadequately responded to the convulsive moment \nthrough which we are living. Climate change, the \nPalestinian question, the crisis in Libya and investment \nin development are just a few examples that illustrate \nits ineffectiveness. Solutions to the great problems of \nour planet are no longer reached within these walls. \nThe most powerful countries of the world rely on other \nforums, exclusionary and anti-democratic ones, to \ndecide for everyone else. If we do not act today on \nthose and other urgent themes, such as the reform of \nthe international monetary and economic systems as \nwell as that of certain United Nations bodies, there will \nbe no point in debating ways to restore the role of this \nworld body in global governance. It is up to us to \nresolve this grave dilemma."

        "file_text": "\nThe annual general debate of the General Assembly \nalways serves as an opportunity for the international \ncommunity to consider the state of the world through a \nseries of exchanges and thus combine innovative ideas \nto support our desire to create a community that will \nensure a better future for all. Burkina Faso always \nparticipates in this meeting of the world partnership \nwith great interest. \n Before I go any further, please allow me, \nMr. President, to offer you sincere and warm \ncongratulations from the Government and people of \nBurkina Faso on your election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, for which \nyou have chosen the theme of strengthening mediation \nas a means of preventing and settling conflicts. Burkina \nFaso fully supports this choice and is committed to \nsharing with the international community its \nexperience in peace negotiations, particularly with \n \n \n21 11-51670 \n \nregard to the role of mediator for the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) that \nPresident Blaise Compaor\u00e9 played in settling the crises \nin C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Guinea. \n I would also like to commend your predecessor, \nMr. Joseph Deiss, on the efficiency with which he \nguided the work of the sixty-fifth session. And I \ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \nsuccessful reappointment to the leadership of the \nUnited Nations. I wish him health and every success \nfor his second term. \n I salute the Republic of South Sudan\u2019s \nachievement of independence and international \nsovereignty, and welcome it to the great family that is \nthe United Nations. The Government of Burkina Faso \noffers its sincere and willing cooperation to the South \nSudanese people and authorities. \n Much has happened since our last session to \naffect the development of the world and our States. \nSome countries have been victims of natural \ncatastrophe; others have experienced financial, \npolitical and social crises. At the beginning of the year \nmy country, Burkina Faso, also had to deal with social \ndemands arising from the difficult national and \neconomic situation. Fortunately, those demands, which \nwere followed by social unrest, were resolved, thanks \nto a sustained and inclusive dialogue initiated by \nPresident Compaor\u00e9. This dialogue, involving all of the \ncountry\u2019s social classes, enabled the Government to \nconduct an exchange of views with every element of \nour society on their concerns, with the aim of arriving \nat suitable solutions. \n Furthermore, the Government of Burkina Faso, \nwithin the framework of strengthening the rule of law \nand improving and reinforcing our system of political \nand institutional governance, established an advisory \ncouncil for political reform aimed at continuing with \nthe political and institutional reforms that began \nseveral years ago. In the economic and social areas, as \npart of our accelerated growth and sustainable \ndevelopment strategy, my Government, despite its \nmodest budget and many other constraints and \npriorities, continued its efforts to build a functioning \neconomy, with a particular emphasis on strengthening \ncertain key sectors, including education, health, water, \ntraining and youth employment; on improving \nsocio-economic infrastructure, especially roads; and on \nencouraging the business environment. \n Needless to say, this progress was made possible \nthanks to the cooperation and support of our bilateral \nand multilateral partners. I take this opportunity to \nacknowledge and thank them for their continuing \ncommitment to supporting us and for their backing for \nour efforts to meet the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n At the subregional and continental levels, \nBurkina Faso, working within the framework of the \nWest African Economic and Monetary Union, \nECOWAS and the African Union, will continue to be \nconstructively involved in strengthening the integration \nprocess. While we proclaim our faith and deep \nattachment to the regional integration process taking \nplace in Africa, we are convinced that regional \nintegration must be pragmatic and based on concrete \nachievements, which represent the only way we can \nrealize our peoples\u2019 legitimate aspirations. At the \nregional level, we recognize the value of all the \ninitiatives that the African Union has taken to manage \nand settle conflicts on our continent. Burkina Faso \nreaffirms its continuing readiness to contribute to \nmaintaining peace, security and stability all over \nAfrica. \n The world is currently experiencing times of \nenormous uncertainty and anxiety as a result of \ninternational economic and financial instability, \nincreased poverty, continuing deterioration of the \nenvironment and a growing number of natural \ndisasters. In particular, the recent international \nfinancial crises are dangerously compromising the \nbalance of our economies and putting our social \ncohesion to a terrible test. They demand a response, \nconstant vigilance and firm solidarity on all our parts. \n The harmful effects of climate change have \nspared no country; natural disasters, in particular, have \ncompromised and shaken the foundations of \ndevelopment for many of us, especially the least-\ndeveloped countries, which are especially vulnerable \nand suffer the most. In tackling this scourge, special \nattention and renewed effort on the part of the \ninternational community are more necessary than ever \nin regard to climate issues, as well as every other \nenvironmental concern. Among other initiatives, \nBurkina Faso commends that of Mrs. Hilary Clinton, \nSecretary of State of the United States, for the Global \nAlliance for Clean Cookstoves, from which countries \nsuch as Burkina Faso could benefit greatly. \n  \n \n11-51670 22 \n \n The High-level Meeting held during this session \non the theme \u201cAddressing desertification, land \ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty eradication\u201d, as well as the \nsigning by various countries, including Burkina Faso, \nof the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic \nResources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of \nBenefits Arising from Their Utilization to the \nConvention on Biological Diversity, are also events \nworthy of commendation. \n Burkina Faso considers particularly important all \nissues connected to the advancement of women and, to \nthat end, has spared no effort to improve the social and \nlegal status of women in our country. We therefore \ncommend the Organization\u2019s establishment of \nUN-Women, and hope that this new body, which \nshould be adequately funded, will be a genuine catalyst \nfor United Nations activities in defence of women\u2019s \nrights. More specifically, we hope it will provide \nstrengthened support for pro-women policies in \ndeveloping countries. We are pleased that during this \nsession the African Group will be introducing a draft \nresolution intended to ban female genital mutilation \nworldwide. We hope that it will be supported by the \nentire international community. \n For more than a decade we have been working on \nthe process of reforming the United Nations in order to \nenable it to be in step with the demands of a world in \nconstant change. Unfortunately, despite significant \nprogress, much still remains to be done. Burkina Faso \nbelieves that the reforms must take into account the \ninterests of all Member States and increase our \nOrganization\u2019s effectiveness in managing the peace and \nsecurity, stability and development of all parties. \n At the dawn of the third millennium, our hope \nand wish was that this millennium would see us \nreconcile with one another and bring peace, security \nand stability. Sadly, our planet is still beset by \nnumerous conflicts, many of which bear the mark of \ninternational terrorism, which, needless to say, Burkina \nFaso firmly condemns in all its forms and \nmanifestations. That is why Burkina Faso, which \nfervently advocates for the prevention and settlement \nof conflicts through dialogue, commends the adoption \nby the General Assembly of resolution 65/283 on \nstrengthening the role of mediation in peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention and \nresolution. We are pleased that that resolution was \nintroduced by the Group of Friends of Mediation, of \nwhich Burkina Faso is a member. \n As we did in Guinea, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Togo and \nDarfur, Burkina Faso is fully prepared to contribute \nwherever it is called upon for mediation, peacekeeping \nand peacebuilding. The organization of free and \ntransparent elections in Guinea and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire came \nas a result of the successful facilitation efforts of \nMr. Blaise Compaor\u00e9, President of Burkina Faso. \n The Ouagadougou Political Agreement allowed \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to emerge from crisis. What it needs now \nis peacebuilding and reconciliation. We take this \nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General, who \neffectively supported the efforts of ECOWAS and the \ninter-Ivorian dialogue facilitator. Beyond facilitation, \nwe are prepared to assist all countries in our subregion \nin their quest for peace and stability in post-conflict \nsituations. We call on the international community to \nsupport peacebuilding efforts, especially in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  \n Burkina Faso participates in the African Union-\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, with a \nforce of 800 men. The signing on 14 July 2011 of the \nDoha Document for Peace in Darfur between the \nGovernment of the Sudan and the Liberation and \nJustice Movement represents significant progress \ntowards restoring lasting peace. \n Thanks to the trust placed in us by the African \nUnion and the United Nations we were able to support \nthe peace process, and we call on all parties to the \nconflict to sign the Doha Document. We express our \nrecognition and profound gratitude to the Emir of \nQatar, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \nAl-Thani, for his support, which was critical to the \nsuccess of the process. \n In the framework of the Implementation Follow-\nup Committee, my country will continue to contribute \nto peacebuilding. We call on the Justice and Equality \nMovement, the Sudan Liberation Movement and the \nGovernment of the Sudan to bring hostilities to a \ncomplete halt in Darfur as soon as possible. \n In North Africa a will for change has found \nexpression in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Burkina Faso \nexpresses its solidarity with those countries in their \nquest for freedom and democracy. We reiterate our will \nto strengthen fruitful links of cooperation. Burkina \nFaso reaffirms its recognition of the Transitional \n \n \n23 11-51670 \n \nNational Council in Libya, and we encourage it to \ncontinue to promote democracy, national cohesion, \nstability and security for all people living in Libya.  \n In the Middle East we closely follow the progress \nof the Palestinian question, and we support Palestine\u2019s \nrequest to be admitted to the United Nations as a full \nMember State. We reiterate our call for a lasting, \ncomprehensive peace in the region that guarantees the \nfreedom and right to self-determination of the \nPalestinian people and the security of the State of \nIsrael. \n Burkina Faso believes in multilateralism, in \nsolidarity among peoples and in the virtue of dialogue \namong nations. My delegation notes with great \nsatisfaction the peaceful climate that currently prevails \nin the relationship between the Republic of China on \nTaiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China. That will \nfavour the granting to the Republic of China on Taiwan \nthe place that it deserves in the concert of nations, \nincluding its genuine participation in the activities of \ninternational organizations such as the International \nCivil Aviation Organization and conferences such as \nthose on the United Nations Climate Change \nConvention.  \n In conclusion, I wish to express the desire that the \nvirtues of international solidarity and dialogue among \nnations will continue to inspire the United Nations, \nwhich is the pre-eminent forum for multilateralism, so \nthat together we can respond to the challenges that our \nworld faces."

        "file_text": "I am taking \nthe floor for the first time, and I would like to reiterate \nour thanks to the President for his dynamism and stress \nthe importance of the role of his country, Qatar, in \ninternational diplomacy. I would also like to thank \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and warmly \ncongratulate him on his new mandate. He can rest \nassured of Portugal\u2019s full and continued support. \n Recognizing the presence in our midst of the \nrepresentatives of the Republic of South Sudan, I want \nto express our best wishes to the authorities of that new \nState in building a peaceful and prosperous future. \n Allow me also to reiterate our warmest \ncongratulations to the delegation of the Libyan \nNational Transitional Council. The Libyan people have \ndisplayed exemplary courage and tenacity in defending \ntheir freedom and right to democratically chart their \nown destiny without fear. The new Libya can continue \nto count on Portugal. \n Ten years have passed since the terrorist attacks \nof 11 September 2001. I want to pay tribute, here in \nNew York, to the people and authorities of the United \nStates, and to praise their courage and determination in \nfacing and overcoming this tragedy. Upholding our \nspirit of solidarity, we remain fully engaged in fighting \nthe scourge of terrorism and in reaching an agreement \non a United Nations global counter-terrorism treaty as \nsoon as possible. \n \n \n57 11-51360 \n \n Cam\u00f5es, the Portuguese poet of the sixteenth-\ncentury maritime discoveries, said that \u201cthe world is \nmade of change, assuming always new qualities\u201d. \nIdentifying the world of change and its new qualities is \nan ongoing challenge that we have to face and respond \nto. We live in a historic time of change and multiple \nand intertwined challenges, qualities and opportunities. \n In our ever-changing world, we now face a \nmassive challenge that requires an urgent collective \nanswer: the relaunching of growth and employment. \nThe economic and financial crisis, which started in the \nlast decade, underscores the reality of interdependence \nat the global level. Overcoming this crisis in a \nsustainable and structured way is a challenge that we \nmust meet collectively. \n To that end, we must correct macroeconomic \ninequalities, strengthen monetary security and \nrebalance world trade. Economic growth is a multiplier \nfor employment at the national and regional levels, and \ndepends for the most part on economic coordination on \na global scale. Governments, international \norganizations, the private sector and social partners \nought to cooperate in a wide-ranging effort to restore \nthe confidence of our citizens and companies. \nProsperity is more than ever an objective that, if jointly \nshared, can be reached by us all. \n In the context of the preparations of the report of \nthe Secretary-General on global economic governance \nto be submitted to the General Assembly, Portugal has \nadvocated greater coordination and complementarity \nbetween the United Nations, the Group of 20 and \nrelevant regional groupings. We have done so because \nwe believe it indispensable to promote the involvement \nof emerging economies, the private sector and civil \nsociety and to enhance their respective roles in global \neconomic governance. \n The European Union is preparing the foundations \nof its economic Government, which is part of the \nEuropean integration process. The economic pillar of \nthe economic and monetary union is also making good \nprogress. That is good news not only for Europe, but \nalso for the rest of the world. Portugal is committed to \nthis endeavour and to meeting the obligations \nundertaken in its economic adjustment programme.  \n The Portuguese Government and people are \nmaking unprecedented efforts to meet their \ncommitments to the International Monetary Fund and \nthe European Union. As has been widely recognized, \nwe are moving quickly and resolutely to consolidate \nour public debt and to implement structural reforms \ndesigned to modernize the economy and promote \neconomic growth and employment. We view the crisis \nas an opportunity to adapt our economic model and to \nstrengthen the Portuguese economy. \n Last year we asked the General Assembly to \nshow its trust in us with regard to our election to the \nSecurity Council. This year I want to express our \ngratitude for the confidence placed in my country, and \nto reiterate Portugal\u2019s firm commitment and attachment \nto the values and objectives of the United Nations, as \nwell as to the principles that motivated our candidacy. \nWe consider the institutional complementarity between \nthe General Assembly and the Security Council to be \nof the utmost importance, and we believe that the \nCouncil should be more effective and more \nrepresentative. In the context of United Nations reform, \nwe need change; we need to see Brazil and India given \npermanent seats on the Council, and Africa should also \nbe included in this enlargement. \n In this ever-changing world, the indispensable \nrole of the United Nations is reflected in the tireless \nand courageous work of thousands of its staff members \nand collaborators. Men and women in military and \npolice uniforms play a fundamental role in peace \noperations to protect civilians, prevent the escalation of \nconflict and create the necessary space and time for \npolitical negotiations to bear fruit. \n The Portuguese are deeply proud of participating \nin this common effort. Our presence in the field \nrepresents one of our main contributions to the \nfunctioning of an effective multilateralism. Portuguese \nBlue Helmets are deployed in Timor-Leste and \nLebanon, and make up one of the largest European \ncontingents in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. They are highly professional military and \npolice officers who make their country and the United \nNations proud. \n The year 2011 started not with winter but with \nspring. The world, as the poet would say, has found a \nnew quality, an opportunity for change created by the \ncourage of the Arab peoples who have come together to \nmake their voices heard loud and clear, defending, \nsometimes at the cost of their own lives, the universal \nvalues and aspirations that embody our community of \nnations. Democracy and human rights are not relative \n  \n \n11-51360 58 \n \nvalues dependent on geography, ethnicity, faith or \neconomic development. \n Libya is opening a new chapter in its history \u2014 a \nnew era of change and reconstruction. The meeting \nheld here earlier this week confirmed the commitment \nof the international community, led by the United \nNations, to supporting the new authorities as they lay \nthe groundwork for a democratic, stable, united and \nprosperous Libya. This was the welcome spirit that \ninspired the Security Council\u2019s unanimous adoption of \nresolution 2009 (2011), establishing the United Nations \nSupport Mission in Libya. We are determined, both in \nthe Council and in the Committee established pursuant \nto resolution 1970 (2011) concerning the Libyan Arab \nJamahiriya, which we chair, to continue contributing to \nthe successful transition in Libya. \n We would also like to see success in the Middle \nEast peace process. Sixty years have passed and there \nis no time left for advances and retreats, the status quo, \nor unilateral actions that are prejudicial to negotiations. \nThe recipes, principles, concrete formulas and road \nmaps are all well known. We do not have to reinvent \nthe wheel. Peace may be difficult, but it is within the \nreach of Palestine, which already embodies all the \ncharacteristics of a State, to which the European Union \nhas greatly contributed. Peace in this time of change is \nalso within Israel\u2019s reach in the framework of a stable \nrelationship and, above all else, security. \n The recognition of a new State naturally falls to \nthe responsibility of each State Member of this \nOrganization. Portugal has backed the concept that the \nEuropean Union, through its High Representative, in \nthe context of the Quartet and in coordination with \nother members of the European Union in the Security \nCouncil, has a constructive and decisive role to play in \nthis process, which is at a crossroads. Europe can speak \nwith one voice to build bridges and facilitate \ncompromise. It should be clear that, just as the creation \nof a Palestinian State is a promise that must be \nhonoured, so, too, the security of Israel must be firmly \nguaranteed by the international community. \n The President of the Palestinian Authority \ndecided to present to the Security Council a request for \nPalestine\u2019s admission to the United Nations as a State. \nThis step must be the result and logical outcome of \nnegotiations. We therefore understand the request to be \nan expression of interest that will be fulfilled with the \nsigning of a peace agreement ending one of the longest \nconflicts of our era. \n Until then, we are open to supporting an \nenhanced status for Palestine in the United Nations. \nThis would be an important step towards the creation \nof a new State, and represent an additional commitment \nby the Palestinians to the negotiation process, \nreinforcing the confidence needed for a definitive and \nglobal peace agreement to be reached. Portugal has a \nunique sensibility in its dialogue with the Middle East. \nWe will use that sensibility and our close relationships \nto assist in finding the only result that is of interest to \nus all: peace. \n The groundbreaking transformation we are \nwitnessing in the Arab world has created new \nopportunities, first for the peoples of the region, but \nalso for countries such as Portugal that have a deep and \nhistoric affinity with the southern shore of the \nMediterranean and the Gulf region. We are building a \ncommon future that involves a new European \nneighbourhood policy and a renewed union for the \nMediterranean. Our ambition is for a new economic \nand commercial relationship, with reinforced \nexchanges in the social field and a new democratic \nsolidarity, shared in a spirit of mutual respect and \nadvantage. \n Portugal went through its democratic transition in \n1974. We know how important the support and \nencouragement of external partners were to us. We are \nready and available to share that experience now as a \nsign of our support and solidarity. An important \nelement of that experience was the contribution and \nfull participation, on an equal footing, of Portuguese \nwomen to the post-revolutionary political process. \n We should remain united in our support for the \ntransition processes and reforms under way in the \nMiddle East and North Africa, and respond in a \ncoordinated manner to the needs identified by our \npartners. I naturally think of Egypt and Tunisia, which \nare preparing to undertake free and democratic \nelections. I am confident that these two countries will \nknow how to meet expectations. \n We note with profound regret, however, that \nmany innocent people in the region are paying too high \na price for their legitimate aspirations. The \ndisintegration of the situation in Syria is unacceptable \nand unsustainable. We welcome the action taken by the \nHuman Rights Council, but we believe that the \n \n \n59 11-51360 \n \nSecurity Council should also take a position in this \nregard. And we urge the Syrian Government to end the \nviolence and the repression of the legitimate \ndemocratic aspirations of its people. \n The democratic transition under way in the \nMiddle East only makes the impasse on the Iranian \nnuclear issue more evident. It is imperative that Tehran \nunderstand that it is time to change and to cooperate \nand that this is in its best interests. \n In the face of current global challenges, we need \na strong and efficient United Nations that is able to \ncooperate closely with other regional and international \norganizations, whose scope of action has deepened and \nbroadened over recent years. Such cooperation can be \ndeepened with the European Union, which only \nrecently gained a new legitimacy in the United Nations \nwith the adoption of resolution 65/276, which we \nwelcome. But such cooperation should also be \ndeveloped with other organizations, such as the African \nUnion, the League of Arab States and the Community \nof Portuguese-speaking Countries. That community of \neight nations on four continents, united by a language \nspoken by more than 240 million people and counting, \nhas a strong vocation to strengthen multilateralism in \nthe service of peace, security and democracy. \n I would also like to commend the efforts of the \nAlliance of Civilizations, a United Nations initiative \nthat, under the leadership of a former Portuguese Head \nof State, Jorge Sampaio, has contributed greatly to \nimproving relations among societies and communities \nof different backgrounds and to promoting a culture of \ndialogue, tolerance and mutual understanding at the \nglobal level. \n The United Nations is us all of us. We all have \nthe responsibility and duty to preserve global peace \nand security and to defend human rights in accordance \nwith the Charter. The promotion and protection of \nhuman rights, as I have already mentioned, is one of \nthe priorities of Portugal\u2019s foreign policy, in line with \nthe other values expressed in the United Nations \nCharter. We take an active position in this field, \ndenouncing situations where civil and political rights \nare being violated and recognizing the social \naspirations of the neediest and most vulnerable  \n \npopulations of our planet, as reflected in our initiatives \non economic, social and cultural rights. \n I would also like to emphasize the importance we \nattach to the promotion and protection of the rights of \nthe child, as well as the human rights of women, \nincluding their participation in political decision-\nmaking. That position is the outgrowth of a broad \nconsensus about and great interest in human rights in \nour country. It is no coincidence that the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and two \nother important United Nations human rights \nofficials \u2014 the Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General for Violence against Children and \nthe Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation, both of them women \u2014 \nare Portuguese. \n It is in that spirit that we decided to present our \ncandidature for the Human Rights Council for the \nbiennium 2015-2017. We participated actively in the \ncreation of that organ, of which we have not yet been a \nmember. We are convinced that our participation in that \nbody would serve as a bulwark in the defence of our \nshared principles. \n Allow me to conclude by reiterating and \nemphasizing Portugal\u2019s commitment to international \nlaw and to the peaceful resolution of conflicts, values \nthat guide our actions in and out of the Security \nCouncil, the other organs of the United Nations, \ninternational organizations and our bilateral relations."

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to begin my \nstatement by warmly congratulating Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon on his re-election to the post in which he \nhas carried out his duties with such effectiveness and \nhonesty. His contributions to the Organization, the \ninternational community and the multilateral system \nover these first five years are well known. We know \nthey will continue to be so in the years to come. \n I would also like to congratulate the President of \nthe sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, \nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser. His \nexperience, ability and dedication are guarantees of \nfruitful work. \n I extend my best wishes to both as they exercise \ntheir vital functions, and they will have Costa Rica\u2019s \nfull support for their efforts in favour of peace, \nsecurity, democracy, disarmament, human rights, \nrespect for the rule of law, sustainable development, \nmediation and the peaceful settlement of disputes. \n I am also very pleased to welcome South Sudan \nas a new Member of the Organization. I believe that its \npeople will enjoy a prosperous, peaceful and safe \nfuture. The emergence of this new State is a testament \nto what can be achieved, even in situations of endemic \nviolence, through serious negotiations between the \nparties and international mediation. \n The intense and invigorating, but still uncertain, \ncurrents of political and social change that have swept \nthrough North Africa and the Middle East this year are \nproof of the universal force of democracy as an \naspiration, of free expression as an incentive, and of \nrespect for human dignity as the most urgent demand. \n Our admiration for the peoples of those countries \nis as great as our hope in their capacity to forge social \nand political systems in peace, systems that are \ntolerant, free and dynamic, in which people are \nrespected and whereby a country can be open to its \nneighbours.  \n We also hope that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \nwill soon come to an end, with two sovereign and \ndemocratic States living in peaceful coexistence. \n From its deepest collective roots, Costa Rica fully \nidentifies with the principles of democracy, peace and \nhuman rights. These are values that we share with the \nimmense majority of Central Americans. \n Disrespect for those values, together with social \nexclusion, the outrages of militarism and the deadly \necho of the Cold War, plunged much of Central \nAmerica into a series of intense conflicts for almost \nfour decades. After tens of thousands of deaths, our \nregion was able, through dialogue and mediation, to \novercome the worst manifestations of political \nviolence. In those overwhelming days, Costa Rica \nmade a decisive contribution by shaping and realizing \nthe Esquipulas Accords, which opened the door to \nreconciliation. \n Since then, progress has been slow and erratic. \nFifteen years ago, as part of that process, Central \nAmerican countries signed the Framework Treaty on \nDemocratic Security in Central America. But the time \nthat has elapsed since then has not sufficed to secure \nthe peace, liberty, democracy and development in the \nregion that we promised our peoples. \n Even worse, we are now victims of a new and \nterrible form of aggression. I am referring to the cold, \ndisastrous and fierce onslaught of transnational \norganized crime. Such activities have generated \ninsecurity, weakened institutions, corrupted officials, \nfostered addiction, cut short the lives of thousands of \nyoung people, destroyed families and turned humble \nsingle mothers into criminals. This scourge has eroded \nthe basic fabric of our society and has jeopardized the \nvery existence of the rule of law in some countries. \n Today, I wish to repeat the comments I made on \n22 June at the International Conference on Regional \nSecurity in Central America, held recently in \nGuatemala. Our region has fallen victim to a perverse \ngeopolitical situation. As Costa Rica is located between \nthe major production centres and the world\u2019s largest \nconsumer market for drugs, we have become a target in \nthe dynamic of death that both create. We must bear the \nburden of exponentially increasing material, \ninstitutional and human costs. What are instances of \nmere collateral damage for some of the main actors in \nthis conflict are, for the people of Central America, \nextreme challenges and a source of deep wounds. \n That is where our greatest frustration lies. That is \nwhy we demand that the international community, in \nparticular the largest consumers of drugs and producers \n  \n \n11-50871 36 \n \nof the weapons that create violence, fully assume its \nshare of responsibility without further delay. \n The International Conference on Regional \nSecurity in Central America, which was attended by \nthe Presidents of all of the countries in the region, from \nMexico to Colombia, was a hopeful turning point. \nThere, we were able to coordinate our strategies. \nThere, we agreed on the need for a comprehensive \napproach to violence that includes measures to \nstrengthen institutions and the rule of law, as well as \ncomprehensive initiatives to prevent and fight crime. In \naddition, we were able to catch the attention of, and \nobtain some promises from, the international \ncommunity. \n Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether the \nstrategies can be translated into effective actions, or \nwhether we will have enough support from external \nresources to drive them forward. Those resources are \nnot merely aid. They are a morally inescapable and, in \npractical terms, indispensable form of compensation \nthat we need to make at least part of the investment \nnecessary to establish peace, stability and security. \n The Secretary-General of the United Nations has \ninsisted, quite rightly, on the need to promote \npreventive diplomacy. I join in that call as President of \nCosta Rica and as a citizen of Central America. I insist, \nbefore the world, that we can wait no longer to act in \norder to avoid an even greater tragedy in our region. It \nis already late; to wait even longer will be tragic. \n Preventive diplomacy demands political will. We \nare approaching another moment in which it will be put \nto the test. I refer to the upcoming United Conference \non the Arms Trade Treaty, which Costa Rica has \nactively supported, along with other States. We need to \nhave the Conference produce a robust, comprehensive \nand demanding instrument capable of effectively \ncontrolling the flow of the death machines that provoke \nall types of conflict. \n Preventive diplomacy, in its deepest essence, also \nmeans fostering democracy and human rights and \nrespecting the rule of law as the cornerstone of security \nand international coexistence. Costa Rica knows it \nwell. Since we abolished the army in 1949, our only \nlines of defence have been the deep civic beliefs of our \npeople, the strength of our institutions and the \ninstruments provided by the multilateral system. The \nsecurity of the 26 other disarmed democracies in the \nworld also depends on those defences. We deserve to \nbe heard and paid attention to. \n A little less than a year ago, our faith in \ninternational law and the instruments and institutions \nthat underpin it was put to the test. Last October, \nNicaraguan troops and civilians invaded and occupied \npart of our national territory, in clear violation of our \nsovereignty, the border treaties and international law. \nAfter exhausting the possibilities of a suitable bilateral \nagreement, we appealed to various forums of the \nregional and international system. Our neighbour\u2019s \nGovernment rejected several of them. Finally, thanks to \nurgent measures ordered by the International Court of \nJustice, the Nicaraguan forces had to leave our \nterritory.  \n However, while we await the Court\u2019s final ruling, \nNicaragua, ignoring the Court\u2019s orders, has continued \nspecific provocations to and violations of the \nprovisional measures. Furthermore, it has threatened \nother actions that could infringe on our territory. We \nhope that that does not occur. But, if it were to, we will \nvigorously reinstate our actions before the machinery \nof the international system. \n All that we request of the Organization and the \nmultilateral system in general is rapid and timely \nconsideration of possible aggressions. The \ninternational community cannot make its preventive \naction conditional on actual armed violence between \nbrothers. It should react not only in relation to the \nquantity and scale of the explosive blasts, but to the \nseverity and persistence of the violations. \n Otherwise, the message to the world would be \ndisastrous. It would imply that the shortest route for \nmobilizing international diplomacy is that of blood. As \na country and as a people, we emphatically reject that \nnotion. \n Based on our firm belief in the importance of the \nrule of law, human rights and humanitarian law, I \ninformed the Assembly a year ago of our aspiration to \nbecome a member of the Human Rights Council. \nToday, I am grateful for the generous support that it \ngave us in achieving that goal. We will remain faithful \nto the promises made at the time and to the proposals \nthat we called for during the review of the Council in \nGeneva and New York. \n In particular, I urge Member States to support an \ninitiative whose time has come: the United Nations \n \n \n37 11-50871 \n \ndeclaration on human rights education and training, \nwhich Costa Rica supports together with a group of \nlike-minded countries. After its unanimous adoption by \nthe Council, it will soon be submitted to the General \nAssembly. We are confident that it will receive similar \nsupport. \n When education, deterrence and other preventive \nmechanisms are unable to avert the worst assaults on \nhuman dignity, the international community faces other \nobligations. Among them is the protection of civilians, \ncontained in the responsibility to protect. My country \nrecognizes that concept as a principle and guide for \naction, whether preventive or reactive, on the basis of \nlegitimate and well-founded decisions. We hope that \nsuch a concept, like human security, is very clearly \ndefined within the Organization. \n Moreover, the fight for human rights requires that \nperpetrators of crimes against humanity be held \naccountable and punished. Today, the International \nCriminal Court is the main multilateral mechanism for \nachieving that goal. I reiterate our support of its \nactivities and urge all States Members of the United \nNations to ratify the Treaty of Rome. I also urge that \nwe should all, as Member States, be more active and \nresolute in our support for the greater effectiveness, \nrelevance and significance of the United Nations; \nhence, the importance of its reform process. \n Costa Rica has joined and will continue to join \ninitiatives that push for the best possible changes. \nAmong other things, we will continue to work \nconstructively for the ongoing improvement of the \nworking methods of the Security Council, through the \nSmall Five group, and for a more representative \ncomposition of that organ, in accordance with the \nguidelines of Uniting for Consensus. \n Costa Rica is a middle-income country. Thanks to \nits commitment to democracy, peace, good governance, \nthe efficient use of international cooperation and its \ninvestments in health and education, Costa Rica has \nachieved high levels of human development. Together \nwith other States with similar characteristics, we \nexemplify the success of international cooperation as a \nkey factor in achieving such results. However, we still \nface serious challenges with regard to poverty, income \ndistribution, regional differences and the consequences \nof the economic crisis and natural disasters, among \nothers. \n We have been responsible, effective and ethical \npartners. We have made progress in development, but \nhave still not been able to consolidate it to the point of \ndispensing with international assistance. We still need \nthat assistance to fully secure our achievements. We \nlook forward to the support and understanding of donor \ncountries and the institutions of the United Nations, in \nparticular the United Nations Development \nProgramme. Our relative success should not be \npenalized, but bolstered. \n Costa Rica has focused on sustainable social and \nenvironmental development. We have taken significant \nsteps to sustain our growth through clean energy and a \nlow-carbon economic model. Our goal is to become \none of the first carbon-neutral countries in the world, \nand we are working diligently to achieve it. \n On that path, in which every local action has \nglobal links, we have confidence in the next \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nClimate Change Conference, to be held in Durban at \nthe end of the year, and in the coming United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development, planned for \nnext year in Rio de Janeiro. However, we are also \nconcerned about the lack of progress made in earlier \nnegotiations. \n I conclude these words by reiterating our deep \ncommitment to the principles set out in the Charter of \nthe United Nations. I am delighted that yesterday we \ncelebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the International \nDay of Peace, a Costa Rican initiative that was adopted \nby consensus by Member States. It gives me even \ngreater pleasure that its theme this year is \u201cPeace and \ndemocracy: Make your voice heard\u201d. \n As national and international leaders, we should \nalways heed the voices of our peoples. We should \nlisten to them, respect them and incorporate them in \nour initiatives. That is part of our democratic \nresponsibility, the basis of good governance, the seed \nof meaningful change and the foundation of legitimacy. \n As President of Costa Rica, a discrete, noble, \nfraternal and free people, I promise not to relent in our \nefforts to achieve a better country and a better world."

        "file_text": "I \nwish to begin by congratulating Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser on having assumed the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its current session. I am confident \nthat, with his outstanding ability and great experience, \nhe will fulfil his lofty mission. I also wish to thank \nMr. Deiss for his contribution as President at the \nprevious session. I further wish to take this opportunity \nto warmly congratulate the Republic of South Sudan on \nbecoming the 193rd member of the United Nations \nfamily.  \n The first decade of the twenty-first century is \nnow behind us. During that decade, the trend towards a \nmultipolar world and economic globalization gained \nmomentum. Countries became increasingly \ninterdependent. Revolutions in science and technology \nbrought profound transformations to human society. \nHowever, various traditional and non-traditional \nsecurity threats and global challenges were intertwined \nwith those changes, and the world was far from a \npeaceful place.  \n As the second decade of the new century begins, \nthe world has entered an extraordinary historical stage \nin its pursuit of peace and development, and continues \nto undergo profound and complex changes. Uncertainty \nand instability are increasing despite the generally \npeaceful international environment. Development is \nbecoming an increasingly serious issue, and promoting \ncommon development has become a more important \nand pressing task than ever before. \n Global development is now at a new critical \njuncture. Global recovery remains fragile, international \nfinancial markets are volatile and the pursuit of \nsustainable development faces daunting challenges. \nThe world economy therefore has to meet the crucial \ntest of maintaining growth. Some countries in West \nAsia and North Africa are in continual political \nturmoil. Terrorist threats are spreading and global \nchallenges growing. The international community faces \na critical test in maintaining stability.  \n The gap in development between the South and \nthe North is as wide as ever. The number of people \nliving in absolute poverty has increased by 64 million \nowing to the international financial crisis. Nearly \n1 billion people suffer from starvation. Urgent action is \nneeded to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \nIt is imperative to step up international cooperation to \nhelp the least developed countries (LDCs) meet the \nbasic needs of their people. In the face of these \nchallenges, we share an important mission to achieve \ncommon development, and we also have rare new \nopportunities.  \n Economic globalization has made the interests of \ncountries more closely interconnected. Ensuring \nsecurity through cooperation and promoting \ndevelopment through stability has become our shared \ndesire. Countries are addressing development \nchallenges in innovative ways. To overcome the crisis, \ndeveloped countries have taken steps to improve their \nfiscal conditions, adopted stimulus measures and \naccelerated economic structural adjustment. \nDeveloping countries as a whole have maintained good \ngrowth momentum. In particular, the rapid growth in \nsome emerging economies has driven the growth of the \nworld economy.  \n Progress has been made in the reform of the \nglobal economic governance structure, and various \nregional cooperation mechanisms are expanding. \nEfforts to accelerate the development of a green \neconomy and explore new modes of sustainable growth \nhave created new momentum and space for common \ndevelopment. Faced with new opportunities and \nchallenges, we should work as a team to overcome our \ndifficulties and pursue mutual benefit and common \ndevelopment. This is the responsibility and mission \nthat history bestows upon all of us. To fulfil our \nmission, we need to take the following steps.  \n We should foster sound momentum for global \neconomic recovery. The underlying impact of the \ninternational financial crisis has yet to dissipate, and \neconomic recovery is still fragile and uneven. We \nshould intensify consultation and coordination, and \nsend a strong message of solidarity and win-win \ncooperation so as to strengthen international \nconfidence in global recovery and growth. We should \nwork for a fair, just, inclusive and orderly international \nmonetary and financial system, and promote the voice \nand representation of emerging markets and developing \ncountries.  \n China supports the transition of the Group of \n20 (G-20) from a short-term crisis response mechanism \nto a long-term mechanism of economic governance. \nThe G-20 should play a bigger role in global economic \ngovernance and in promoting the full recovery and \ngrowth of the world economy.  \n  \n \n11-51384 42 \n \n We support the efforts of emerging markets to \nexplore new modes of international economic \ncooperation. We strongly oppose protectionism in all \nits forms and call for strengthening the multilateral \ntrading regime. The concerns of the least developed \ncountries should be addressed, and efforts made to \nmake the Doha Round achieve its development \nobjectives. \n We should lay the political foundation for \ncooperative development. All countries, big or small, \nstrong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the \ninternational community, and their equal right to \ndevelopment should be protected. Mutual respect and \nequality are the basic norms governing international \nrelations and constitute an important guarantee for \ncommon development. In the current context, it is of \nparticular and practical importance to adhere to the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \nNations, to uphold the authority and role of the United \nNations, to observe in good faith the principle of \nnon-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs, and to \npromote democracy in international relations.  \n We should respect the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of all countries. The internal affairs of each \ncountry should be decided by its own people. We \noppose interference in other countries\u2019 internal affairs \nby whatever means and under whatever pretext.  \n The diversity of the world is a valuable asset for \nthe development of human society. It should be seen as \na positive factor that allows countries to learn from one \nanother, and should not be used as an excuse for the \nbig to bully the small or the rich to ride roughshod over \nthe poor in international relations. We should respect \nthe right of each country to pursue the development \npath of its choice and we should respect the diversity \nof civilizations. We should seek common progress by \ndrawing on one another\u2019s strength with an open and \ninclusive mind, pursuing common ground while \npreserving differences. \n We should foster a security environment \nconducive to stability and development. History has \nrepeatedly shown that stability and development go \nhand in hand. Without stability, there can be no \ndevelopment; without development, there can be no \nstability. In keeping with the purposes and principles of \nthe United Nations Charter, we should always use \npeaceful means to settle international disputes and \nhotspot issues. We should oppose the wilful use or \nthreat of force, terrorism, separatism and extremism in \nall their forms, and we should uphold the common \nsecurity of humankind. \n China respects the independent choice of the \npeople of the Sudan and South Sudan, and hopes that \nthe new-born country of South Sudan will enjoy \nstability and development. The international \ncommunity should continue to support and encourage \nthe Sudan and South Sudan to resolve their outstanding \nissues appropriately through dialogue and consultation, \npursue amicable relations and common development, \nand uphold regional peace and stability. China has \nencouraged the Sudan and South Sudan to resolve their \ndispute through peaceful negotiation and has worked \nhard to advance the peace process between them. We \nsupport the proper settlement of the Darfur issue. We \nwill continue to work with the international community \nto play a constructive role in advancing regional peace, \nstability and development. \n China has consistently supported the just cause of \nestablishing an independent Palestinian State, and \nsupports Palestine\u2019s membership in the United Nations. \nWe support efforts to achieve a two-State solution \nthrough political negotiation so as to establish, on the \nbasis of the 1967 borders, an independent Palestinian \nState that enjoys full sovereignty, with East Jerusalem \nas its capital. We believe that progress should be made \nin parallel in the peace talks between Syria and Israel \nand Lebanon and Israel, with an ultimate view to \nachieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in \nthe Middle East along with peaceful coexistence \nbetween the Arab countries and Israel. We hope that \nthe international community and the parties concerned \nwill make unremitting efforts to this end and sustain \nthe Middle East peace process. \n China is greatly concerned about the turbulence \nin West Asia and North Africa. We stand for the \nprinciple of non-interference. We respect and support \nthe efforts of countries in those regions to \nindependently handle their internal affairs, and we \nrespect their aspirations. We hope that the parties \nconcerned will resolve their differences through \npolitical dialogue and speedily restore stability and \norder in their respective countries.  \n Libya has now entered a critical transition from a \nstate of war and turmoil to national reconstruction. \nChina respects the choice of the Libyan people and \nrecognizes the National Transitional Council (NTC) as \n \n \n43 11-51384 \n \nthe governing authority of Libya and the representative \nof its people. We hope that, under the leadership of the \nNTC, the parties in Libya will launch an inclusive \nprocess of political transition through which they will \nmaintain ethnic harmony and national unity, restore \nstability as soon as possible and begin economic \nreconstruction. China supports the leading role of the \nUnited Nations in Libya\u2019s post-conflict reconstruction, \nand urges the speediest possible operationalization of \nthe United Nations Support Mission in Libya.  \n China is also greatly concerned about \ndevelopments in Syria. We hope that parties in Syria \nwill exercise restraint, avoid all violence, further \nbloodshed and conflict, and act quickly to ease \ntensions. We believe that a Syria-led, inclusive political \nprocess aimed at promoting reform through dialogue \nand consultation is the right way to resolve the current \ncrisis in Syria. The international community should \nrespect the sovereignty, independence and territorial \nintegrity of Syria, and address the Syrian issue \ncautiously so as to prevent further turbulence and \nrepercussions on regional peace. \n China welcomes the positive developments on the \nKorean peninsula. We believe that dialogue and \nconsultation are the only effective way to address the \nissues of the peninsula. The Six-Party Talks are an \neffective mechanism for advancing the denuclearization \nof the Korean peninsula and for upholding peace and \nstability both on the peninsula and in North-East Asia.  \n China has worked hard to promote peace through \ndialogue, and has played a unique role in easing \ntensions and maintaining peace and stability on the \nKorean peninsula. China welcomes the recent \nresumption of dialogue between the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, \nas well as between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea and the United States. We hope that the \nparties concerned will seize the opportunity, remain \nengaged in dialogue and work for an early resumption \nof the Six-Party Talks. \n We should promote balanced development \nbetween the South and the North. The uneven \ndevelopment between South and North is the biggest \nimbalance in the global economy. Without balanced \ndevelopment, there can hardly be sustainable \ndevelopment. Unless underdeveloped countries shake \noff poverty and grow their economies, there can be no \ncommon global prosperity.  \n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals on \na global scale and on schedule is an urgent and arduous \ntask. Developed countries should honour their \ncommitments on official development assistance, open \ntheir markets, reduce and cancel debt, and their step up \nfinancial and technological support to developing \ncountries. International financial institutions should \nuse their resources to help developing countries, and \nparticularly the LDCs, on a priority basis. Developing \ncountries, on their part, should explore growth models \nthat are conducive to development and poverty \nalleviation in order to achieve a higher level of \ndevelopment. \n Food security has emerged as a major challenge. \nThe Horn of Africa is suffering from massive famine \ntriggered by the most severe drought in 60 years. The \ninternational community should scale up assistance, \nstabilize the price of food and other commodities, and \nhelp developing countries enhance their capacity for \nautonomous development so that all countries and \nregions can enjoy the benefits of common \ndevelopment. \n The world witnessed major development, \ntransformation and adjustment in the first decade of the \ntwenty-first century. During this period, China enjoyed \nsustained and fast development, and its relations with \nthe outside world underwent profound changes. \nChina\u2019s achievements in development, and its possible \nfuture course, have become a focus of international \nattention. Over the past 10 years, China\u2019s economy \ncontinued to grow, and its people\u2019s living standards \nrose markedly, thanks to the hard work of the Chinese \npeople. Today, China has become the world\u2019s second-\nlargest economy, largest exporter, second-largest \nimporter and largest emerging market. The basic living \nneeds of China\u2019s 1.3 billion people are being \nadequately met, and the number living in absolute \npoverty has fallen drastically. \n On the other hand, the difficulties China faces in \nterms of development should not be ignored. We \nremain a developing country with a large population, a \nweak economic foundation and serious imbalances and \nlack of coordination in our development. China will \nhave to make persistent and strenuous efforts to \nachieve its development goals. Guided by our recently \nadopted twelfth five-year plan for economic and social \ndevelopment, we will pursue scientific development, \naccelerate the shift in our growth model, advance \nscientific and technological innovation and increase \n  \n \n11-51384 44 \n \nreforms and openness designed to promote long-term, \nsteady and fast economic development, as well as \nsocial harmony and progress. The world will see a \nmore open China, with more sustainable development \nand greater social harmony. \n China\u2019s development has brought real benefits to \nthe Chinese people and contributed to global \ndevelopment and prosperity. During the past 10 years, \nChina imported close to, on average, $750 billion \nworth of goods annually, creating more than 14 million \njobs for the relevant countries and regions. At the end \nof the twelfth five-year period in 2015, China\u2019s total \neconomic output will be around $8.6 trillion. It is \nexpected that China will import about $10 trillion in \ngoods in the next five years, which will further boost \nworld economic growth. China needs the world in \norder to be able to continue to develop, and China\u2019s \ndevelopment will in turn contribute more to the shared \ndevelopment of the world as a whole. \n As a developing country, China is committed to \nenhancing mutually beneficial cooperation with other \ndeveloping countries, based on equality, and to \nenhancing its efforts to provide them with assistance \nand support. China has cancelled 380 debts incurred by \n50 heavily indebted poor countries and LDCs, and will \nphase in zero-tariff treatment for 95 per cent of exports \nfrom the African LDCs with which China has \ndiplomatic relations. We have completed more than \n2,100 projects, including building schools and \nhospitals, in other developing countries, and trained \n150,000 professionals in various fields for them. In \nsympathy with the pain of the countries and people in \nthe Horn of Africa hit by famine, China has decided to \nprovide those countries with RMB443.2 million in \nemergency food assistance and cash for purchasing \nfood to help them overcome the famine. \n China has made notable efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. As it continues to \ndevelop, China will create more opportunities for \nworld peace, development and cooperation. To advance \ncommon development, we must foster a sound \ninternational environment. Over the years, China has \nbeen dedicated to creating a peaceful international \nenvironment in which it can develop. At the same time, \nit has contributed to enhancing world peace through its \nown development. China has actively assumed \ninternational responsibilities as its capacity permits, \nand has worked to promote the peaceful settlement of \nissues in troubled areas.  \n China participates actively in international \npeacekeeping operations; with a total of more than \n19,000 personnel deployed in 28 United Nations \npeacekeeping missions, China is the largest contributor \nof United Nations peacekeeping personnel among \nSecurity Council permanent members. China has \nprovided assistance in cash and kind to countries hit by \nearthquakes and tsunamis, and has sent rescue teams to \ncarry out humanitarian relief operations in the affected \nareas. China is actively involved in the fight against \npiracy and in other areas of international cooperation. \nAll these efforts have contributed to maintaining world \npeace and stability. \n The tide of history is surging forward. In the next \ndecade, peace, development and cooperation will \nremain trends of the times, and China will not waver in \nits pursuit of development and progress. Peaceful \ndevelopment is the strategic choice that China has \nmade to build a modern, strong and prosperous country \nand to make a greater contribution to the progress of \nhuman civilization. China will stay on that path, \npursuing an independent, peaceful foreign policy and a \nwin-win strategy of opening up its society. \n We are committed to achieving a better life for \nthe Chinese people and greater development and \nprosperity for all humankind. We will achieve those \ngoals through hard work, reforms and innovation, and \nby conducting long-term friendly exchanges and \nestablishing equality-based, win-win cooperation with \nother countries. A prosperous, harmonious and stable \nChina that lives up to its responsibilities will make a \ngreater contribution to the prosperity and stability of \nthe world and the common development of humankind. \nLet us work together to deepen cooperation and \nachieve development by sharing opportunities and \nmeeting challenges together, and thus build a \nharmonious world of lasting peace and common \nprosperity."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to convey to the \nPresident, on behalf of His Excellency Army General \nFran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, Head of State and President of the \nCentral African Republic, who it is my honour to \nrepresent here, our heartfelt congratulations on his \nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. He can rest assured of our full \nreadiness to cooperate with him to ensure the success \nof his challenging task. I would also like to pay well-\ndeserved tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. Joseph Deiss, for the talent and dedication that he \ndemonstrated as he steered our work throughout the \nsixty-fifth session of the Assembly. To His Excellency \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, I convey my heartfelt \ncongratulations on his reappointment to the head of the \nOrganization.  \n Lastly, the Central African Republic welcomes \nthe admission of South Sudan, a brotherly \nneighbouring country, as the 193rd Member State of \nthe United Nations. \n In proposing \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes through peaceful means\u201d as the \ncentral theme of the general debate of the sixty-sixth \nsession of the Assembly, the President has placed our \ndeliberations at the very heart of those problems that \nare of current concern to the international community. \nIt must be recalled that the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security around the world \ncontinues to be the primary mission of the \nOrganization, and that, for Member States, mediation \ncontinues to be an indispensable tool in the peaceful \nsettlement of conflicts. The Central African Republic \nremains committed to the principles of the United \nNations Charter, which enshrines language pertaining \nto the peaceful settlement of conflicts \u2014 principally \nthrough mediation and prevention. \n The international community faces many \nchallenges to which we need to provide tailored \nresponses in order to together build a better world.  \n We attach particular attention to the issue of \nclimate change and the environment. Protecting the \nenvironment and combating climate change are major \nchallenges, as well a priority for the international \ncommunity, given the many and varied risks that they \npose to ecosystems and economies.  \n The commemoration, next year, of the twentieth \nanniversary of the first Earth Summit on sustainable \ndevelopment will be devoted to forests. Tropical \nforests, including those in the Central African \nRepublic, are exposed to various harmful and \ndestructive activities associated with the pressure \nexerted by social problems and natural disasters. The \ncountries concerned have recognized the need to \nformulate land-use policies in order to conserve their \nbiodiversity, both in terms of flora and fauna, in these \nregions.  \n Furthermore, the drought that is currently \nafflicting the Horn of Africa, where approximately \n  \n \n11-51398 16 \n \n12 million human lives are threatened, is a source of \nmajor concern and requires broad-scale mobilization \nby the international community.  \n That brings me to the issue of food security. The \nCentral African Republic will support a draft resolution \non food development, some provisions of which would \nbe incorporated in the various resolutions of the \nAssembly and in other United Nations meetings \nthroughout the year. \n Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament \nremain a priority. The Central African Republic \nwelcomes the renewed interest in disarmament on the \npart of the international community. Greatly concerned \nby the nuclear threat to all of humankind, non-nuclear-\nweapon States are entitled to call upon those who \npossess nuclear weapons to fully shoulder their \nresponsibilities by implementing specific measures to \nbring about genuine nuclear disarmament. For its part, \nthe Central African Republic will spare no effort to \nsupport any United Nations initiative to that end. \n Today, terrorism remains a scourge of the \ninternational community. In resolution 1963 (2010), the \nSecurity Council declared its intent to hold a special \nmeeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) on \n28 September 2011, open to all United Nations \nMember States, to mark the tenth anniversary of the \nadoption of its resolution 1373 (2001) establishing the \nCTC. It should be recalled that the CTC has done a \ngreat deal in assisting Member States in undertaking \nactions to combat this scourge by strengthening the \nimplementation of standards and border controls, as \nwell as in the fight against the financing of terrorism. \n The Central African Republic remains committed \nto the universal values of human rights, democracy and \ngood governance. We reaffirm our commitment to \nworking throughout this sixty-sixth session with the \nother Members of the United Nations to provide \nresponses that uphold those values.  \n The fight against impunity and against violations \nof human rights is a given for our community. We hope \nto see it placed within an overall approach that does \nnot hinder the process of political crisis and conflict \nresolution around the world or undermine regional and \ninternational efforts provided for by the United Nations \nCharter. \n The Central African Republic attaches special \nimportance to the reform of this Organization and all \nits bodies with regard to their structures, modes of \noperation and work methods. For this reason, we \nremain committed to the African position regarding the \nSecurity Council. Indeed, in all the ongoing crises in \nthe world, the Security Council has gradually imposed \nthe authority of the United Nations, placing it at the \nservice of international peace and security. Its action is \nand remains legitimate. Its authority will be further \nstrengthened when we reach an agreement on its \nexpansion, which will enable us to take the emergence \nof new Powers into account by giving a more equitable \nplace to all continents. \n Like many African States, my country has been \nengaged on the path towards democratic governance \nsince the 1990s. As part of our democratic process, we \nhave endeavoured to improve the management of \npublic policy on the political, economic and social \nfronts. We are aware that much remains to be done in \nthese spheres.  \n The renewed trust of the Central African in His \nExcellency General of the Army Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 \nYangouvonda, President of the Republic and Head of \nState, has given him the opportunity to pursue the \nsuccessful task he began on 15 March 2003. We are \ndetermined to break with instability and at long last to \nturn the page on political-military upheavals. That will \nenable him to focus on reconstruction. In other words, \nwe will do everything to consolidate that peace that \nguarantees enduring development. Without peace and \nsecurity, there can be no economic development that \nbenefits the population as a whole.  \n It is from this standpoint that the Central African \nGovernment held a round table in Brussels with our \ndevelopment partners on 16 and 17 June in order to \nraise the awareness of the international community \nwith respect to the funding needs of the programmes \noutlined in the second poverty reduction strategy paper. \n The matter of security remains at the very heart \nof our concerns. Part of the population of the Central \nAfrican Republic continues to suffer the aggression of \nrebels belonging to the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) \nof Joseph Kony. The activity of the LRA, a cruel and \nbarbaric rebellion from a country that shares no \nborders with the Central African Republic, remains the \nsource of atrocities, destruction, looting, rape, forced \nrecruitment and the deportation of men, women and \nchildren. Mobilization on all sides and the shared \n \n \n17 11-51398 \n \nallocation of resources are needed to eradicate that \nscourge once and for all. \n The Government of the Central African Republic \ngreatly appreciates the initiatives of the United \nNations, the African Union and the United States on \nthis issue. We continue to believe that the Republic of \nSouth Sudan will join other affected countries in this \nrelentless struggle against a cross-border enemy that \nharbours vague ambitions harmful to the stability \nrequired for development of our subregion. \n The December 2010 withdrawal of the United \nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \nChad left a security vacuum that my country is trying \nto fill despite our limited resources. The same holds \ntrue for Mission for the Consolidation of Peace in the \nCentral African Republic deployed by the Economic \nCommunity of Central African States, whose mandate \nexpires at the end of December 2013. \n Reinforcing the capacities of our defence and \nsecurity forces, which are slated to take over from the \ninternational forces, is still far from complete. I should \nlike here to thank the United Nations through its \nPeacebuilding Fund, which has been supporting the \nCentral African Republic in its tireless quest for peace \nand stability. \n In the light of all this, I appeal once again to the \ninternational community to take urgent action in order \nto build peace and prevent conflict in the Central \nAfrican Republic. We welcome in advance all \ncommitments that have been or will be made on our \nbehalf. We are convinced that the dividends of those \nefforts will benefit both the Central African Republic, \nwhich lies at the heart of the African continent, and the \nentire subregion."

        "file_text": "I warmly \ncongratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his well-deserved \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. I am confident that under his able \nand dynamic stewardship, we will achieve our goals. I \nthank former President Joseph Deiss for the success of \nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also \nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the wise \nselection of the theme \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means\u201d for this \nyear\u2019s general debate.  \n I take this opportunity to welcome South Sudan \nas the 193rd Member of the United Nations and \nwarmly congratulate the people of the newest State on \nattaining their freedom and independence. \n I believe that peace is the basis for development. \nI also believe that peace prevails when justice prevails. \nTherefore, justice at home and abroad is important for \nensuring the peaceful mediation and settlement of \ndisputes. My father and the father of my nation, \nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who espoused \nthe principles of \u201cfriendship towards all, malice \ntowards none\u201d and \u201cpeaceful settlement of disputes\u201d, \nalso believed in this, and declared it from this rostrum \n37 years ago. \n Thus, justice for peace found its place in my \nGovernment\u2019s domestic and foreign policy and has \ncontributed to strengthening Bangladesh\u2019s secular, \ndemocratic and progressive ideals. A strong foundation \nin the rule of law has also helped in the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes with our neighbours and formed \nthe basis of our participation in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations. Emphasis on peaceful \nnegotiations has also enabled Bangladesh to maintain \nan annual gross domestic product growth rate of 6 per \ncent, create thousands of jobs, reduce poverty and \nexpand social safety net schemes to the poor, \ndisadvantaged, elderly and deprived women. \n \n \n41 11-51360 \n \n The role of the United Nations has changed since \nits establishment. The maintenance of international \npeace and security now includes the new challenges of \nintra-State ethnic strife, terrorism, transnational crimes, \nclimate change, poverty, energy and water security, as \nwell as the widening gap between the rich and the poor. \nHowever, the successes of the United Nations have \nreinforced the belief that, in the twenty-first century, it \nremains the most legitimate and universally accepted \ninternational body with the ability to harness the global \ncollective will necessary for the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes through mediation. \n Bangladesh therefore commends the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report on enhancing mediation and its \nsupport activities (S/2009/189) for promoting the better \nuse of the United Nations mediation mandate, and \nco-sponsored resolution 65/283 on strengthening the \nrole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes, conflict prevention and resolution.  \n To demonstrate its strong commitment to conflict \nresolution, Bangladesh has partnered in many United \nNations endeavours for peace, democracy and \ndevelopment. Our contribution to United Nations \npeacekeeping of 102,294 peacekeepers in 52 missions \nand 36 countries has sadly led to the loss of the lives of \n103 brave Bangladeshis. Our involvement also includes \nthe first all-women United Nations police unit in Haiti. \n As Non-Aligned Movement Coordinator in the \nPeacebuilding Commission, Bangladesh is always \nadvocating in favour of peacebuilding, development \nand preventive diplomacy in post-conflict societies. \nUnfortunately, we remain woefully underrepresented at \nthe planning and strategy-making levels of the \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, which should \nbe promptly redressed. As a member of the Human \nRights Council and the Economic and Social Council, \nwe conscientiously promote democracy, secularism, \njustice and the rule of law, and equal rights for women, \nchildren, minorities and other vulnerable groups. As a \nmember of the executive bodies of the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations \nPopulation Fund, UNICEF, UNESCO and the Food and \nAgriculture Organization, we are committed to setting \nglobal norms and standards in development practices. \n Since I believe that justice brings peace, in 1997, \nduring my previous term as Prime Minister, I mediated \nthe Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord for the \nmarginalized communities of the Hill Tracts region. \nThe Accord, which was signed after intense \ndiscussions, ended a 20-year conflict that cost over \n20,000 lives. During the same term, I mediated the \nsigning of the 30-year Ganges Water Sharing Treaty \nwith neighbouring India. During my current term, this \nmonth we mediated and signed memoranda of \nunderstanding with India on our border demarcation, \nan issue that had been pending for the past 64 years, \ncausing obstructions in the everyday life of my people. \nI am committed to settling all our problems with \nneighbouring India through discussion. \n During my current term and soon after forming \nthe Government, one of the most dangerous challenges \nthat I have faced was the mutiny of our border forces, \nwhich took 72 lives. Yet, that time, too, I chose a \nmediated settlement, thereby avoiding possible further \nloss of life. As a result, I came to believe that there can \nbe no peace without justice. We have established an \nindependent International Crimes Tribunal to try those \nresponsible for war crimes committed during our \nliberation war in 1971. Their eventual punishment will \nstrengthen our democracy and show that the State is \ncapable of just retribution. \n As a State party to the Rome Statute of the \nInternational Criminal Court, we believe in the \nStatute\u2019s mandate of bringing perpetrators to justice. I \nam fully committed to battling terrorism in all its \nforms, having personally suffered from acts of terror. \nHere, I recall with profound sadness the brutal \nassassination of my father, the first President of \nBangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, \nand 18 of my immediate family members, including \nmy mother and three brothers, on 15 August 1975. I \nalso recall the grenade attack on me and my followers \nat a peace rally on 21 August 2004, which left 24 dead \nand nearly 500 injured. I miraculously escaped but \nwith permanent loss of hearing. \n I often think of all the victims of terrorism, \nespecially those of the 11 September 2001 attacks in \nNew York, as well as attacks that have taken place \nelsewhere in the world. Indeed, if peace is to prevail, \nthese terrorists must be brought to justice. \n Our Government has a zero-tolerance policy \ntowards terrorism. Our aim is to break the nexus \nbetween terrorism, extremism and radicalization and \neliminate all of them from Bangladesh, a State party to \nall United Nations counter-terrorism conventions. At \nthe same time, we are strengthening our democratic \n  \n \n11-51360 42 \n \ninstitutions, such as the commissions on elections, \nanti-corruption, human rights, information, as well as \nour judiciary, legislature and law enforcement \nagencies, which are tools for eliminating terrorism and \nextremism. \n Since justice begets peace and peace is vital for \ndevelopment, our policies are attuned to ensuring \npeoples\u2019 rights. In pursuing the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), we are also fulfilling our \npeople\u2019s aspirations. The United Nations Award for \nMDG 4 on reducing child mortality, which I received \nlast year, is a case in point. We are also on track to \nachieve MDG 1 on poverty alleviation, MDG 2 on \nuniversal primary education, MDG 3 on gender \nequality and MDG 5 on reducing maternal mortality. \nOur poverty reduction strategy is in tandem with the \nMillennium Development Goals and intends to raise \n12 million people out of poverty by 2015. \n For development, we have integrated women\u2019s \neducation into our State policy. There is a saying that \ngoes, \u201cIf you educate a boy, you educate a person; if \nyou educate a girl, you educate a family and a whole \nnation\u201d. Therefore, during our first term from 1996 to \n2001, we adopted a national women\u2019s development \npolicy that has been revised during our current term to \nmake it more relevant. The policy provides for the \nempowerment of women, their participation in \ndecision-making, their protection, and gender equality. \nEducation for girls is free up to the twelfth grade, and \nsteps are on their way to ensure their free tuition until \ngraduation. \n Following the 2008 general elections, women\u2019s \nparticipation in politics increased with their election to \n12,828 reserved seats in local Government bodies and \n64 members in the national Parliament. We also have \nfive women Cabinet ministers in charge of agriculture, \nhome, foreign affairs, women\u2019s and children\u2019s affairs, \nand labour. The Opposition Leader, the Deputy Leader, \na Whip and, of course, the Prime Minister are all \nwomen. For the first time in our history, two women \nMembers of Parliament have been made Chairs of \nParliamentary Standing Committees. Women now \noccupy high positions in the Supreme Court, in civil, \npolice and armed services, and in United Nations \npeacekeeping missions. Female business ventures also \nreceive support from the Small and Medium Enterprise \nFoundation. \n To achieve our election pledge of a digital \nBangladesh and to make Bangladesh a middle-income \ncountry by 2021, the golden jubilee year of our \nindependence, we are expanding the reach of \ninformation and communications technology \nthroughout the country. UNDP Administrator Helen \nClark was with us this year to witness the launching of \ne-connectivity through our 4,500 information and \nservice centres, which provide Internet access to \nmillions of rural people. We have also set up an \ne-centre for rural communities, which connects 8,500 \npost offices, a high-tech park, e-governance \ncapabilities and an e-infrastructure-building process.  \n I believe in that health for all is an essential \nprecondition for development. Primary health-care \nservices are delivered through 11,000 community \nhealth centres in rural areas, with each providing \nservices to 6,000 people. My Government has also \nrecently started raising awareness about autism and \ndevelopmental disorders in children. Last July, we \nlaunched the Global Autism Public Health Initiative in \nDhaka to help those disadvantaged with such disorders. \n However, to pursue those efforts and to develop \nsocio-economic security, least developed countries \n(LDCs), such as Bangladesh, need international \nsupport. The support must come from granting us \nmarket access, removing trade barriers, the fulfilment \nof overseas development aid and combating climate \nchange. The commitments made in Istanbul this May \non agriculture, energy, infrastructure, water and \nmigration would also strengthen the economic stability \nof LDCs. It is now time for development partners to \nimplement the commitments made in Monterrey, Paris \nand Brussels before the conclusion of the Doha \nDevelopment Round. Support must continue to enable \nLDCs to fulfil their Millennium Development Goals. \n Such support is especially important for \nBangladesh under the extra tension of climate change. \nA metre rise in the sea level due to global warming \nwould inundate a fifth of our landmass, displacing over \n30 million people. That would be the largest \nhumanitarian crisis in history. In order not to lose time, \nwe have prepared a 134-point adaptation and \nmitigation plan that includes river dredging, \nafforestation of 20 per cent of the land, increasing food \nproduction with crop varieties adapted to climate \nchange, et cetera. We also established the Climate \nChange Trust Fund with $300 million from our own \n \n \n43 11-51360 \n \nfunds and the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience \nFund with $110 million from donors.  \n Bangla is spoken by over 300 million people \nworldwide. I earnestly appeal to Member States to back \nmy proposal to declare Bangla one of the official \nlanguages of the United Nations. I also seek their \nsupport for Bangladesh\u2019s annual flagship resolution on \na culture of peace, which I launched in 2000, when I \nwas Prime Minister for the first time. \n Throughout my half-century in politics, I have \nalways been a crusader of peace. I believe that peace is \nachievable by eliminating injustices, which includes \nRepression, the absence of the rule of law, inequality, \neconomic disparity, deprivation, poverty, the \nsuppression of self-determination, the denial of \nsecularism and multi-ethnicity, the negligence of equal \nrights for women and the marginalized, and the lack of \ntransparency and accountability of Governments. \nThose types of injustices, according to the Uppsala \nConflict Data Programme, led to the loss of more than \n5 million lives from 1964 to 2011. I believe that such \ndeaths could have been avoided by strengthening the \nmediation instruments of the United Nations and by \nplacing people at the centre of peace and development. \n In fact, my life experiences have inspired me to \ncome up with a new peace model, based on the \nempowerment of people. It is a multidimensional plan \nthat champions democracy and places people\u2019s \nempowerment at the centre, with six mutually \nreinforcing peace multipliers. They are: first, the \neradication of poverty and hunger; secondly, the \nreduction of inequality; thirdly, the mitigation of \ndeprivation; fourthly, the inclusion of excluded \npersons; fifthly, the acceleration of human \ndevelopment; and sixthly, the elimination of terrorism. \n I call it the people\u2019s empowerment model. It \nreaffirms that all people should be treated equally, and \nemphasizes the empowerment of people and the \nenhancement of human capabilities for the realization \nof peace. \n Prosperity is achievable with the removal of \ninjustice and disempowerment in an environment of \npeace. That is possible by individual nations through \nsincere implementation of what is right, sometimes \nunder the guidance of the United Nations. Let us all try \nto test that model of people\u2019s empowerment, which I \nbelieve has the potential to transform our world of \n7 billion people into one where our future generations \nmay prosper and live in happiness. \n May Bangladesh live forever. Long live the \nUnited Nations."

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Majesty and the people \nof Brunei Darussalam, I would like to congratulate our \nnew President, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \n  \n \n11-51384 20 \n \nAl-Nasser. These are not only personal congratulations. \nWe also congratulate his country, Qatar, our fellow \nMember of the United Nations. We greatly appreciate \nits significant efforts to promote dialogue, consultation \nand mediation in many difficult situations, both in its \nown region and far beyond. Thus we thank the \nPresident, as its representative, and warmly welcome \nhim to the General Assembly as the representative of \nus all.  \n We would also like to express our appreciation to \nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss. His \nterm of office saw another impressive contribution by \nthe United Nations to meeting the great international \nchallenges Members face in the first decade of this new \ncentury.  \n Some of that work began right here, in this \nbuilding, with our efforts to reform the Security \nCouncil and revitalize the General Assembly. Other \nefforts addressed our world at large and the \nconfrontation between essential economic growth and \ncritical environmental realities that it faces. Still others \nwere aimed directly at the people we represent. Those \nefforts addressed their health and food security; \nconsidered their personal and legal status, whether at \nhome or as members of immigrant communities; and \nexamined the systems of governance under which they \nlive. \n This is a fine record, and we thank the outgoing \nPresident for his leadership. He was greatly assisted in \nhis work by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We offer \nthe Secretary-General our very best wishes for the \ncoming year. We welcome his reappointment and join \nfellow Members in thanking his staff and the United \nNations volunteer workers, peacekeepers and agencies \nfor all of their efforts in many extremely difficult \nsituations.  \n It is a tribute to their work that one of the \nlongest-running and most complex situations of all has \nbeen resolved this year. As a result, we add our own \nwords of welcome to the Government and the people of \nSouth Sudan as a new Member of the United Nations. \nWe also commend all parties involved in the process of \ndialogue, negotiation and final resolution. At the same \ntime, it is our deepest wish that these same sentiments \nmay soon be expressed to the parties directly involved \nin efforts to reach a fair and equitable two-State \nsolution to the situation in Palestine. \n The President of the Assembly has asked us to \nconsider the role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means. In doing so, we follow the \ndirection given by His Majesty the Sultan in his \naddress to the General Assembly in 1984, when we had \nthe honour of becoming a Member of this great \nOrganization. In outline, it committed us to mutual \nrespect for territorial integrity and the principles of \ndialogue and negotiation in disputes, no matter how \nlong or how frustrating the process may be.  \n We still adhere to that principle. We give \nwhatever practical assistance we can, whenever asked. \nWe do so directly, through peacekeeping and \nmonitoring efforts, and indirectly, through financial \ncontributions made bilaterally and to relevant United \nNations and regional bodies. In these ways, we seek to \nfollow the commitments made in our first General \nAssembly debate.  \n Nevertheless, we increasingly recognize that \nthose commitments were made over a quarter of a \ncentury ago. Twenty-five years is a common definition \nof a generation in human terms, which means that a \nnew generation is now moving into positions of \nauthority. Behind it, a further generation is now \ncoming of age. It has no personal memory of the global \nsituation that shaped international policy in the Cold \nWar era. Although both generations are naturally still \ninfluenced by those times and the leaders who brought \nthem to this point, they are also new generations, for \nwhom the new century shapes world affairs. \n In our statement to the General Assembly three \nyears ago (see A/63/PV.10), we outlined our approach \nto this by broadly setting out what are now regarded as \nthe challenges of this new century. Some involve \nsecurity in all of its forms \u2014 political, physical and \neconomic. Others address the natural environment and \nthe effects of climate change. Still others raise \nquestions about sustainable development and many \nchallenges arise from the concept of good governance, \nboth nationally and in world organizations such as the \nWorld Trade Organization, the International Monetary \nFund, the Group of Twenty and even the United \nNations itself. We have given our full support to the \ngreat institutions of which we are members and will \ncontinue to do so. \n But our Government has emphasized one thing \nthroughout this year in all international gatherings we \nhave been privileged to attend. It is not a change in our \n \n \n21 11-51384 \n \noverall approach; it represents a particular focus. It \nmeans that more and more we are trying to identify the \nchallenges in basic human terms, because we feel that \nsuch a focus relates directly to the wise theme the \nPresident proposed for this debate.  \n We acknowledge with deep respect that \nsuccessful mediation has always been a cherished \nobjective of the United Nations, and we strongly \nsupport that ideal. At the same time, however, we \nmaintain that no mediation can be successful unless the \nparties involved share common ground. \n What concerns us is that the dynamics of the \ntwenty-first century have the potential to exclude many \nfrom this common ground. It will become the exclusive \nterritory of great unseen globalized forces, whether in \nthe market, the workplace or in the world of great \ndecision-making forums. That development could be so \ndivisive as to destroy any common ground.  \n We believe such common ground will only be \ncreated by ordinary people, as individuals and in their \nfamilies and communities, who feel that they are \nindeed occupying that common ground. For them, \npolitical security lies in the principles of diplomacy \namong all nations, especially respect for each other\u2019s \ntraditions, values, beliefs and ways of life. Physical \nsecurity means the rule of law. Economic security is \nfood on the table, a job and the best possible support \nfor health, education and old age.  \n In all these efforts, we have felt well guided by \nthe United Nations, above all through the \nencouragement it provides towards achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals and the confidence in \nthe future that they give to all people. That, we believe, \nwill lead us towards the common ground we are trying \nto discover. It will be reached when it is shared among \nthe most powerful of industrialized nations and the \nsmallest of threatened island communities. The search \nfor common ground is the immense task of both \npresent and future generations. We believe that only \nwhen it is concluded can mediation successfully \nperform the role suggested in the President\u2019s theme."

        "file_text": "I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I have no doubt that, under your able \nleadership, the Assembly will be able to complete its \n \n \n31 11-51670 \n \ndeliberations and proceedings successfully. In that \nrespect, I wish to assure you of Malaysia\u2019s full support \nfor your presidency. Permit me also to congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as \nSecretary-General. \n The theme you have chosen for the general \ndebate, \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means\u201d, is apt, fitting and timely. \nIndeed, the United Nations itself was established as an \ninstrument of mediation to promote peace, security and \nstability among the nations of the world. Many in this \nbody have spoken about the importance of settling \ndisputes through mediation. Malaysia shares that view. \n In the final analysis, peace can be achieved only \nif people are willing to engage in mediation. Now, \nmore than ever before, mediation must be made to \nwork in the Middle East crisis, as it is the only option \navailable for the achievement of lasting peace. \n Year after year after year, we have hoped for a \npeaceful and just resolution of the Palestinian issue. In \nthe time that we have spent hoping, we have also come \nto realize that mediation is the only means of providing \na sustainable resolution to all conflicts and crises. As \nsuch, all of us have a role to play in ensuring that it is \neffective. Patience and prudence have their merits, but \npatience and prudence must not result in paralysis. This \nbody and the Security Council have adopted numerous \nresolutions on Palestine, yet there has been no tangible \noutcome.  \n We support the application of the Palestinians to \nthe United Nations and welcome the readiness of both \nparties to hold talks on the basis of the existing \ninternational legal framework. In that connection, \nMalaysia fully supports the legitimate rights of the \nPalestinian people to an independent State of Palestine, \nbased on the two-State solution, taking into account the \nsecurity concerns of both parties. \n For some time now, our world has been battered \nby unprecedented political challenges, devastating \nnational calamities and financial crises. During that \ntime, our institutions and mechanisms have seemed \nincapable of handling these challenges and the pace at \nwhich they surface. To compound the situation, while \nwe address long-standing causes of international \ninstability, non-traditional threats to peace and security, \nsuch as terrorism, pose additional challenges.  \n As we share the grief of those who lost their \nloved ones in the 9/11 attack 10 years ago, we must \nstrengthen our resolve to eradicate terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations. That can be achieved only \nby addressing the root causes of terrorism, which \nwould cut off sympathy and support for those \ncommitting acts of terrorism. We must at the same time \nwin the hearts and minds of the people to ensure that \nour victory over terrorism is not short-lived. \n But the winning of hearts and minds is only half \nof what I would call the battle of perceptions. The \nother half consists of combating expressions of \nextremist sentiments. Despite our continuing efforts to \npromote world peace and harmony, we still witness the \nincreasing trend to perpetuate and fuel Islamophobia. \nThere have been attempts to pit Islam against the West, \ndemonize Islam and to link Islam with terrorism. Those \nirresponsible acts further intensify the divide between \nthe broader Muslim world and the West.  \n The real issue is not between Muslims and \nnon-Muslims but between moderates and extremists in \nall religions, whether Islam, Christianity or Judaism. It \nis in light of the growing tide of extremist sentiments \naround the globe that the Prime Minister of Malaysia \ncalled for the creation of a global movement of \nmoderates at this Assembly last year (see A/65/PV.19). \nThis clarion call has come at the right moment in \nhistory. We must ensure that the voices of moderation, \nwhich currently constitute the silent majority, prevail \nover those of extremism in efforts to find solutions to \nthe growing challenges faced by the international \ncommunity. \n There has been wide acceptance of this \nmovement at the highest levels of global political \nleadership, such as the Asia-Europe Meeting and the \nEast Asia Summit. More recently, the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations has endorsed the movement of \nmoderates as its contribution to global developments. \nMalaysia will work diligently to ensure that the global \nmovement of moderates will complement the ongoing \nactivities of the United Nations Alliance of \nCivilizations and other intercultural and interfaith \ndialogues so that moderation will triumph over \nextremism. \n We cannot turn a blind eye to the needs of States \nthat are severely affected by natural calamities. The \nsituation in Somalia has touched the hearts of many. \nFor our part, Malaysia last month pledged $1 million to \n  \n \n11-51670 32 \n \nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Trust \nFund for Somalia and dispatched a humanitarian \nmission to mitigate the sufferings of our Somali \nbrothers and sisters. A valiant Malaysian son lost his \nlife carrying out this mission. However, such incidents \nwill never deter us from continuing to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to all other countries in need. \n In the field of the environment, we seem to be \nlosing focus. We know that we are not lacking in good \nplans, but that we lack political will and the means to \nimplement those agreed plans. As much as we are \nconcerned about implementation failures, we are also \nconcerned at the paralysing differences in on the areas \nof institutional framework and sustainable \ndevelopment. The failure of the Commission on \nSustainable Development to deliver a successful \noutcome last May clearly demonstrated that.  \n The lack of progress and unwillingness to honour \ncommitments under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change is another example. We \nmust ensure that the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities, coupled with historical \nresponsibility, is enshrined in all our endeavours to \nachieve a successful conclusion on climate change \nnegotiations and sustainable development. \n In moving towards the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development, there are new \nthoughts on strengthening the institutional frameworks \nfor the environment. If the current institutional \nframeworks are unable to meet the daunting \nenvironmental challenges, we may have to look at new \nmechanisms that are inclusive and participatory, with \nequitable decision-making responsibilities. \n Nuclear disarmament occupies a central role in \nthe work of the United Nations. This is reflected by the \nfact that the very first resolution adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly spoke, among other things, of \u201cthe \nelimination from national armaments of atomic \nweapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to \nmass destruction\u201d (resolution 1(I), para. 5 (c)). Yet \n65 years on, it remains a silent dream. All States need \nto do their part in order to achieve more substantive \nprogress in this area. \n Malaysia is committed to working with other \nMember States to realize the goal of a nuclear-weapon-\nfree world. We will continue to advocate the total \nelimination of nuclear weapons through a nuclear \nweapons convention. To progress further on that issue, \nconsensus is required on commencing the multilateral \nnegotiations process. This, in turn, will require good \nfaith on the part of the States possessing nuclear \nweapons. I call on all those States to demonstrate such \ngood faith. \n It is apparent that the current international \nfinancial architecture is unable to cope with recent \ndevelopments in the world financial markets. The \nWorld Bank has warned that we are about to enter a \ndanger zone. We need a new financial architecture that \nwill be transparent, equitable, representational and \nparticipatory and that will reduce volatility. Lessons \ncan be learned from the economies of developing \ncountries that embarked on economic reform and \nstrengthened their financial institutions following the \nAsian financial crisis. Let us put pride aside and learn \nfrom each other. \n In our quest to move up the value chain and \nenhance competitiveness, Malaysia has embarked on \nits own transformation programmes based on the \nconcept of One Malaysia, the Government transformation \nprogramme, the economic transformation programme \nand the new economic model. As part of the \ntransformation programme, Malaysia has taken a giant \nleap in reforming its internal security and emergency \nlaws, which will be replaced by legislation to prevent \nsubversive action, terrorism and organized crime. \n Malaysia is transforming and reforming itself to \nbetter adapt to a changing global landscape. We believe \nthat the United Nations must do the same. We would \nlike to see a comprehensive reform of the United \nNations so that it will be able to face current realities \nand address present challenges. Most particularly, the \nSecurity Council should be comprehensively reformed \nto make it more legitimate, representative, democratic \nand transparent. The Council must be effective, \ntransparent and accountable to the larger United \nNations membership in order to strengthen its \nmediation capacities. It must not remain beholden to \nthe veto holders. \n In that respect, I return to the President\u2019s theme. \nWe need to adopt mediation in the search for peace. To \nthat, I would add the principles of transformation and \nmoderation. A combination of mediation, transformation \nand moderation will constitute a winning formula to \nrealize lasting world peace. Let us take up the \nchallenge with the fortitude required and together \nimplement it for a united and a better world for all."

        "file_text": "Solomon Islands, \nwith much pride, wishes to thank our Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \nhonouring my country with a historic visit earlier this \nmonth. He is the first Secretary-General to have set \nfoot on a Pacific small island developing State with \nleast developed country (LDC) status. His re-election \n \n \n13 11-51372 \n \nto a second five-year term speaks to his strong \nconviction in advancing multilateralism and his \nattentiveness to the challenges facing all members, \nincluding the vulnerable countries. We once again \npledge our support to the Secretary-General during his \nsecond term in office. \n Let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the \nleadership and tireless work of Mr. Joseph Deiss as \nPresident of the General Assembly during the past \nsession, and to congratulate the President of the current \nsession on his election. I am confident that, under his \nleadership, the responsibilities of the United Nations \nwill be strengthened, especially at a time when there is \nnervousness in world markets, with the threat of a \npossible double-dip recession becoming more real \nevery day; a time when the world is witnessing unrest \nin Asia, riots in Europe and famine in the Horn of \nAfrica; a time when the narrow interests and ambitions \nof some are being cycled through the United Nations \nsystem, thereby harming the principles for which this \nOrganization stands. \n In this respect, the theme for the sixty-sixth \nsession, \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means\u201d, is fitting and timely. The \nOrganization was set up to preserve peace for all, not \nconditional peace for some. It is about honest \ninternational cooperation built on a spirit of optimism \nand positivism. It is about interaction between States \nwith a sense of duty and an awakened conscience to \neffect change. Multilateral diplomatic and political \ninitiatives need to take centre stage instead of military \nsolutions, which may lead to lengthy and protracted \nconflicts. \n The role of mediation in Solomon Islands is about \ncreating a common voice among the 87 different \nlanguages spoken in the country. The Government \nremains committed to building a cohesive multicultural \nsociety with equal opportunities for all. The Solomon \nIslands Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and \nPeace, along with the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission, is in its third year of continuing to build \nbridges between formerly conflicting parties by \nconveying a message of tolerance, respect, dialogue \nand understanding among Solomon Islanders. \n I am pleased to say that my Government is \nreforming and improving our democratic system by \nsetting the goal of continuing national consultations on \nthe Political Parties\u2019 Integrity Bill, introduced in 2009 \nby the previous Government. We are developing a \ncomprehensive policy to identify legislation that needs \nto be reviewed or enacted. \n Solomon Islands has set itself progressively \nambitious goals within the various international \nframeworks. We can achieve all of those goals only by \nhaving focused a relationship with the United Nations. \nWe feel that the United Nations needs to engage in \nspecial outreach to countries with special needs, \nespecially those lagging furthest behind, so as to assist \nthem in implementing the outcomes of global \nagreements. To make a difference, the international \ncommunity must honour its commitments, and do so by \ngiving sufficiently to ensure that the required economic \ntransformation occurs in LDCs and small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS). \n Multilateralism has provided the basis for our \nforeign policy. We opened a second Permanent Mission \nto the United Nations, in Geneva, in June this year, and \nwould like to see our action reciprocated with an \nenhanced United Nations country presence in Solomon \nIslands. We have an over-regionalized United Nations \nsystem that has seen problems grow in the Pacific. \nSmall as we are, three of our Pacific countries have \nexperienced conflict over the past two decades, and \nfive of the 12 are listed as least developed countries. \n Today, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) claim \nsix in every 10 lives in the Pacific. Non-communicable \ndiseases are pandemic in the region. In that regard, \nSolomon Islands has put in place a non-communicable \ndiseases strategic plan for the period 2011-2015. \nPrevention remains the cornerstone of our NCD policy, \nas does the development of our primary health \ncoverage across the country. We will continue to need \nsustained external support in the short to medium term \nso that we can implement our NCD programmes. \n Solomon Islands, as a least developed country, \napplauds the adoption in May of the 10-year Istanbul \nProgramme of Action for the least developed countries. \nThe Programme provides an opportunity to lift \n880 million people within the international community \nout of poverty. The 48 LDCs have developed a \nprogramme with the ambitious target of seeing half of \nthe LDCs graduate by 2020. The programme focuses \non investing in the productive sectors of LDCs in order \nto tackle our development challenges by triggering \nstable, sustained and inclusive economic growth. \nPartnership is critical to support investment in income-\n  \n \n11-51372 14 \n \ngenerating activities, employment creation, infrastructure \ndevelopment, rural agricultural development and \ninvestment in smallholder farmers. Solomon Islands, in \nreaching out to the 85 per cent of its population living \nin rural areas, is currently implementing parallel \nsectoral and constitutional reforms and land reform \nprogrammes. \n Solomon Islands supports the call for the \nSecretary-General to conduct structured discussions on \na post-2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nagenda. As we all must realize and admit, we will fall \nshort of achieving the Millennium Development Goals \ncome 2015. The review must examine the means of \nachieving the social and development goals. That \nmeans looking at the MDGs from a sustainable \ndevelopment perspective. Solomon Islands looks \nforward to that discussion. \n On climate change, we call on the Secretary-\nGeneral to garner the necessary political will from our \ndeveloped partners to adopt a second commitment \nperiod in Durban under the Kyoto Protocol. This would \navoid a gap between the first and second commitment \nperiods and would be sufficient to ensure the survival \nof all vulnerable people and prevent climate change \nimpacts from reaching irreversible levels. \n Problems associated with climate change are \ngrowing challenges for our country. We are taking \nseveral practical measures. The Government is \nplanning the relocation of our national referral hospital \nto higher ground. Efforts to build a resilience policy on \nfood and water security are progressing under the \nadaptation programme. Our climate change challenges \nare growing, and fast-track funds promised two years \nago must be made available to vulnerable countries as \na matter of real urgency. Solomon Islands is in the \nprocess of establishing economic growth centres \nthroughout the country, and we are looking at powering \nthese centres with renewable energy, which we view as \na necessity and a condition for growth. \n Solomon Islands is grateful for the growth of \nSouth-South cooperation and its policy engagement \nwithin the international community, especially support \nfrom such countries as Cuba, India and Papua New \nGuinea. We also welcome new non-traditional partners \nwith our region, including Luxembourg, Georgia and \nItaly, who have rendered support and are instrumental \nin complementing the support from our traditional \npartners the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, \nthe Republic of China and Japan. \n Solomon Islands, as a post-conflict country, \nremains engaged with the Australia-led Regional \nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), \nwith support from New Zealand and other Pacific \nIslands Forum member countries. The Secretary-\nGeneral, during his recent trip to my country, had a \nbird\u2019s eye view of the achievements of RAMSI in the \nrestoration of law and order and the reform of our \neconomic and governance systems. My country \nremains grateful to all our Pacific neighbours for their \nsupport and reiterates that any winding down of \nRAMSI activities should be done in a calculated and \nresponsible manner.  \n We continue to seek homegrown solutions within \nthe region. The Melanesian Spearhead Group has \nagreed to establish a Melanesian regional police \nacademy, bringing together Fiji, Papua New Guinea, \nVanuatu and Solomon Islands discipline forces to \nrespond to emerging needs, from disasters to conflicts. \nSolomon Islands hopes to join Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua \nNew Guinea in having its police force participate in \nUnited Nations missions. Work is still in progress, and \nwe hope to conclude it soon. \n Within my region, Solomon Islands continues to \nsupport the inscription of the French territory of New \nCaledonia on the United Nations decolonization list \nand will extend similar support to French Polynesia, \nworking with all stakeholders, including the \nAdministrator. In particular, the Melanesian Spearhead \nGroup countries strongly support the inscription of \nNew Caledonia and French Polynesia for \ndecolonization. \n The current international system has pushed us to \nthe edge of our finite natural resources. The United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development in \nRio next year will be another global opportunity to \nidentify gaps within existing sustainable development \nframeworks, from the Barbados Programme of Action \nand the Mauritius Strategy, which recognize the special \nsituation of small island developing States, to the \nIstanbul Programme of Action for LDCs. We strongly \nurge signatory countries to honour their commitments. \n Solomon Islands looks forward to the \nnegotiations scheduled for late this year. Already, we \nare in the midst of preserving the last global stock of \ntuna by creating the world\u2019s first sustainable industrial \n \n \n15 11-51372 \n \nfishing industry through a subregional intergovernmental \nmechanism. Fisheries remain our source of food and \nincome, and we will need to maximize returns from \nthese resources in a sustainable manner by bringing \ntogether three pillars of sustainable development on \nequal footing and in a balanced and sustainable \nmanner. \n Solomon Islands is host to the regional Pacific \nIslands Forum Fisheries Agency, and we continue to \nregister our interest in hosting the regional marine \nscientific and technological centre of the United \nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea to advance \nmarine scientific research in the Pacific region and to \nfoster the transfer of marine technology for the \ndevelopment of our ocean and marine resources. \n Solomon Islands believes in dialogue and \nengagement with all countries of the world, including \nFiji. We do so within the framework of the United \nNations Charter and the Melanesian Spearhead Group \nprinciples, with mutual respect for each other\u2019s \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, \nnon-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs, \nequality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence with \neach other. We would like to encourage all States to do \nlikewise. \n I am equally pleased to say that, since my \nGovernment came into office some 14 months ago, we \nhave established relations with more than 27 countries \nand will continue to reach out to all countries to ensure \nthat Solomon Islands remains connected in our \ninterlinked world. On this note, I welcome a new \nmember to our family of nations, South Sudan. We \noffer South Sudan our friendship and look forward to \nworking with it on all issues of common concern to our \ncountries. \n The 51-year-old economic blockade of Cuba \nremains an issue stuck in time. Solomon Islands, in a \nspirit of friendship and in observation of the principle \nof good neighbourliness, makes a humble call on our \npartner and friend, the United States, for the \nunconditional lifting of the economic blockade against \nthe people of Cuba. We request that the two States \nrenew, restore, revive, redeem and reclaim their \nfriendship and respect for each other\u2019s sovereignty \nwithin the letter and spirit of the United Nations \nCharter. \n Solomon Islands will host the eleventh Festival of \nPacific Arts next year to celebrate and promote the \nunique and diverse indigenous cultures of the Pacific. \nThe Festival will give us an opportunity to express our \nsense of pride, awareness and recognition of the \n\u201cPacificness\u201d of the isolated communities within the \nPacific and to develop and preserve a deep sense of \nsolidarity and unity through our ancient music, body \nart, dances and languages. We look forward to \nreceiving our guests in 2012. \n On the long-standing conflict in the holy land, \nSolomon Islands supports the work of the Quartet. We \nnote that more than two-thirds of United Nations \nMember States recognize Palestine as a State. Solomon \nIslands, in the name of peace, believes that the \ninternational community must have the strength and \nstamina to act decisively, build on the two-State \nsolution and overcome the distrust that exists in the \nregion multilaterally. \n On Security Council reform, Solomon Islands \ncontinues to support the intergovernmental \nnegotiations on expansion in the number of permanent \nand non-permanent seats of the Council. My delegation \nis mindful of the fact that the most recent Security \nCouncil reform occurred in 1965. The world has \nchanged since then. We need to streamline the current \nnegotiating text within our informal intergovernmental \nnegotiation process and join other small island \ndeveloping States in calling for a non-permanent seat \nin the Security Council explicitly for small island \ndeveloping States. \n On the issue of human rights, I am pleased to say \nthat Solomon Islands has submitted its national human \nrights report to the Human Rights Council. For a \ndeveloping country, the right to development is the \ncore of the country\u2019s policy. Putting people at the \ncentre of development, their meaningful participation \nand the fair distribution of national wealth and benefits \nwill bring peace to an angry man, feed a hungry child \nand empower our womenfolk. \n My delegation would like to acknowledge the \nchange in nomenclature within the 53-member Group \nof Asian States to the Asia and the Pacific Small \nIslands Developing States Group. This is an important \ndevelopment and truly represents the diversity of \nmembership that exists within the Asia Group. We \napplaud our Asian colleagues for taking such a \ndecision. \n On the issue of gender, Solomon Islands has huge \nchallenges, to the extent that it will seek a regional seat \n  \n \n11-51372 16 \n \nwithin the Executive Board of United Nations Entity \nfor Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. \nSolomon Islands is presenting its candidate as a Pacific \nSIDs-endorsed candidate, and with the support of the \nAssembly it hopes to give an LDC and SIDS flavour to \nthe Board. \n On Taiwan cross-strait relations, my delegation \ncontinues to commend the ongoing dialogue between \nthe Republic of China on Taiwan and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. We note Taiwan\u2019s continuous \ncontributions to the global health system in terms of a \nwide range of international development programmes, \nand welcome its participation as an observer to the \nWorld Health Assembly. We continue to call for such \narrangements to be extended to other United Nations \ntreaty bodies, including the United Nations Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure the \nmeaningful participation of Taiwan and its people in \nthe affairs of the international community. Solomon \nIslands also acknowledges Taiwan\u2019s climate change \nmitigation and renewable energy programmes with \ndeveloping countries, and would like to see the \napplication of similar observer arrangements extended \nto Taiwan within the UNFCCC. \n Let me conclude by expressing once again my \ndelegation\u2019s confidence in translating our global \nagenda into action within the next 12 months. Many \nlives depend on that. On behalf of the Government and \npeople of Solomon Islands, I assure the Assembly of \nour support and cooperation."

        "file_text": "Let me at \nthe outset commend Mr. Al-Nasser on his unanimous \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. I hereby pledge to him my \ndelegation\u2019s full support for his efforts to successfully \nmove forward the agenda of this session. I wish also to \ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, for \nhis stewardship. \n I would be somewhat remiss if I did not \ncommend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nleadership of our treasured Organization. I am pleased \nto lend my voice to those of other Heads of State and \nGovernment who have commended him on his \nreappointment for a second five-year term beginning \n1 January 2012 and to wish him every success in his \nbold quest to develop an Organization that is both \neffective and efficient and can bring about meaningful \nchange in the complex world in which we live. \n Mr. Al-Nasser\u2019s choice of the theme for the \ngeneral debate, namely, \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means\u201d, could not \nhave been more timely or appropriate.  Mediation is \none of the cornerstones of the Organization. While it is \ntrue that mediation should not be the only tool \navailable to the international community to mitigate \nconflicts, there is nevertheless a growing interest in \nmediation and its use as a promising and cost-effective \ntool in the peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict \nprevention and resolution. \n In addition, we, as a community of nations, have \non many occasions recognized the useful role that \nmediation can play in preventing disputes from \nescalating into conflicts and conflicts from escalating \nfurther, as well as in advancing the resolution of \nconflicts and thus preventing and reducing human \nsuffering and creating conditions conducive to lasting \npeace and sustainable development, and in this regard, \nrecognizing that peace and development are mutually \nreinforcing. \n In the general debate of the sixty-fifth session, I \nas well as others called for lasting peace in the Middle \nEast (see A/65/PV.20). I also issued a call for \nimplementation of the two-State solution, which would \nhave Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace \nand security. Neither of these notions is new; sadly, \nneither is anywhere close to realization, Given the \ncurrent state of affairs, it should come as no surprise to \nanyone that the Palestinian people would seek a \ndifferent option \u2014 full membership in our \nOrganization or, failing that, a vote by the General \nAssembly that would elevate the status of Palestine \nfrom non-voting observer entity to Observer State, a \nstatus equal to that of the Holy See. \n As we have said in previous debates, we remain \nfully supportive of the aspirations of the Palestinian \npeople and of the idea of a two-State solution, which \nwould allow the Palestinian people the right to govern \nthemselves and reach their potential in a sovereign and \ncontiguous State. It was against this backdrop that we \ndecided to join with others that have already done so \nand grant recognition to the State of Palestine. As we \ndid then and do now, we believe that recognition of the \nState of Palestine will contribute to the quest for a \nnegotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \nand to the creation of lasting peace and stability in the \nregion, and ultimately result in a viable Palestine and a \nsecure Israel, based on the 1967 lines, with mutually \nagreed swaps to ensure that secure, recognized borders \nexist for both sides. \n Many of today\u2019s conflicts are fuelled by the \nillegal trade in small arms and light weapons. Those \nsmall weapons of mass destruction have had a \ndevastating impact on the countries of our region over \nthe past decade, and have been directly implicated in \nthe associated rise in crime and violence involving the \nuse of firearms. Needless to say, those weapons have \nhad a significant adverse impact on security and socio-\neconomic and human development in our countries. \n In their 2007 annual reports, both the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime and the World \nBank identified our region as having higher murder \nrates than any other region in the world. They also \nstated that small arms and light weapons were used in \nmore than 70 per cent of those murders. We never \nsought that dubious designation, which was anything \nbut welcome. \n This is why, at our most recent summit in July \n2011, my fellow Heads of State of the Caribbean \nCommunity adopted a Declaration on Small Arms and \nLight Weapons in which, inter alia, we agreed  \n \u201cto accord the highest national and regional \npriority to matters related to combating and \n \n \n37 11-51360 \n \neradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons and their ammunition\u201d [and] \u201cto \nintensify and sustain engagement in the United \nNations effort for the conclusion of a legally \nbinding Arms Trade Treaty\u201d. \nI call on all States Members of our Organization to join \nour region in this worthy endeavour.  \n The very existence of many developing countries \nas viable States is at stake. The world financial and \neconomic crisis continues to threaten debt \nsustainability in our countries through its impact on the \nreal economy and the increase in borrowing we had to \nundertake in order to mitigate the negative impacts of \nthe crisis. \n The recent gyrations in the major stock markets \nof the world do not inspire hope for lasting global \neconomic recovery any time soon. Now more than \never, if we are to overcome the current crisis we need a \nnew mechanism for restructuring and resolving \nsovereign debt that takes into account the multiple \ndimensions of debt sustainability.  \n This seemingly unending economic crisis has \naffected our countries not only in economic terms, but \nalso through the presence of barriers to trade, as well \nas the financing embedded in some of the anti-crisis \nmeasures adopted by some developed countries. More \nimportantly, the crisis has impacted our social \ndevelopment, which in turn has led and continues to \nlead to a major loss of jobs and difficulties in financing \nsocial programmes that address poverty or the \nprovision of basic amenities. All those factors threaten \nour efforts to attain the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n While my country has made good progress with \nthe United States on our online gaming dispute, we \nurge the United States to remain committed to reaching \na mutually agreed outcome that will bring value to our \neconomy and is implementable by the United States. \n With so much at stake, we will soldier on in our \nquest to seek market access openings in key sectors \nand other innovative incentives that could include but \nwould not be limited to financial and technical support, \nforensics, equipment and training for dealing with drug \ntrafficking and for the creation of decent jobs for the \npeople of Antigua and Barbuda. \n Mine is not the only country in the Caribbean that \nhas experienced trade-related difficulties with the \nUnited States. A far more pernicious economic, \ncommercial and financial blockade has been imposed \nby the United States of America on Cuba, and although \nthe overwhelming majority of membership of the \nUnited Nations has repeatedly called for that blockade \nto be lifted, it continues unabated. As a country \ncommitted to the norms of the multilateral trading \nsystem and the freedom of trade and navigation, and as \na nation that rejects the extraterritorial application of \nanother country\u2019s national law, we call on the United \nStates to immediately and unconditionally lift its \neconomic blockade against the people of Cuba. \n On 19 September, almost 11 years to the day \nsince the World Health Assembly endorsed the \nlandmark Global Strategy for the Prevention and \nControl of Non-communicable Diseases to reduce the \ntoll of premature deaths due to non-communicable \ndiseases (NCDs), the General Assembly adopted a \nPolitical Declaration (resolution 66/2) that, among \nother things, calls for the launch of a global NCD \ncampaign. \n While there is much to be lauded in the \nDeclaration, we are nevertheless disappointed that \nsome of our original expectations, including a clear \ngoal for the launching of the global NCD campaign \nwith a corresponding road map, may not have been \nfully developed. However, we believe that, if \nrigorously implemented, the Declaration will \ncontribute to the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Let it be known that we will do \nour utmost to ensure that the momentum generated at \nthat meeting is not lost. \n Two days ago, we held a one day High-level \nMeeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of \nAction \u2014 the internationally recognized blueprint for \naction to fight racism that was adopted by consensus at \nthe 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial \nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \nheld in Durban, South Africa. To this day, the \nDeclaration remains an innovative and action-oriented \nagenda to combat all forms of racism and racial \ndiscrimination. \n This tenth anniversary is a chance to strengthen \npolitical commitment to fighting racism and racial \ndiscrimination. It is also an opportune time to revisit \n  \n \n11-51360 38 \n \nthe issue of reparations for slavery, which is central to \nany discussion about racism, colonialism and poverty. \nAntigua and Barbuda has long argued that the legacy of \nslavery, segregation and racial violence against peoples \nof African descent has severely impaired our \nadvancement as nations, communities and individuals \nacross the economic, social and political spectrums. In \nobtaining redress for the injustices suffered by African \nslaves and their descendants, today\u2019s Caribbean and \nAfrican peoples would advance immeasurably the \nprocess of genuine healing. \n Those who choose to differ have argued that, \nunlike victims of the Holocaust or those who have been \ninterned during wars and have subsequently received \nremunerations, neither the victims nor the perpetrators \nof slavery are alive today, and that it is unfair to hold \nthe descendants of slave-owners responsible for the \nactions of their ancestors. \n On this we strongly disagree. However, no one \nshould disagree that racism and other legacies of \nslavery continue to shape the lives of people of African \ndescent. Thus, reparations must be directed towards \nrepairing the damage inflicted by slavery and racism. \nThat is why we call on former slave States to begin the \nreconciliation process by issuing formal apologies for \nthe crimes committed by those nations or their citizens \nover the 400 years of the African slave trade. To help \ncounter the lingering damage inflicted on generations \nof peoples of African descent by generations of slave \ntrading and colonialism, we call on those very States to \nback up their apologies with new commitments to the \neconomic development of the nations that have \nsuffered from that human tragedy. \n The United Nations has declared 2011 to be the \nInternational Year for People of African Descent. \nThroughout the year, nations and communities of the \nAfrican diaspora have undertaken a number of \ninitiatives aimed at the realization of the full \nenjoyment of economic, cultural, social, civil and \npolitical rights; participation and integration in all \npolitical, economic, social and cultural aspects of \nsociety; the promotion of a greater knowledge of and \nrespect for their diverse heritage and culture, with \npronounced emphasis on encouraging multilateralism \nand development approaches; and the creation of a \nglobal Afro-centric movement. \n The time has come for peoples of the African \ndiaspora to begin helping themselves. A key part of \nthat process is the first African Diaspora Summit, to be \nheld in South Africa in mid-2012. The Summit and its \npreparatory process will provide a platform for the \nAfrican diaspora to put in place economic policies \naimed at ensuring sustained economic cooperation \namong public and private stakeholders, so as to \npromote development, entrepreneurship and business \nopportunities in diasporan regions. \n By 31 October, our planet will reach a milestone \nof sorts. Somewhere on the Earth\u2019s surface, the planet\u2019s \n7-billionth inhabitant will be born. Seven billion \npeople! If nothing else, that milestone will serve to \nreaffirm our determination as the international \ncommunity to implement sound development policies \nand promote the inherent right and dignity of each \nperson. Coming amid the preparations for the 2012 \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro, a world of 7 billion \ninhabitants reminds us of the critical need to pay \nattention to population dynamics if we are to \nunderstand the needs of our people, proactively plan to \navoid development pitfalls, and develop forward-\nlooking policies that promote the health and dignity of \nevery human being on Earth, while at the same time \nsafeguarding the planet we call our home. \n By making the necessary investments to develop \nquality human capital, with equally strong measures to \npromote gender equality with the active promotion of \nwomen and youth participation in all spheres of life, \nwe will create the enabling conditions for transforming \nthe economies of developing countries in order to \neradicate poverty and achieve the internationally \nagreed Millennium Development Goals. Policies \nresponsive to the needs of our population not only \ncontribute to dynamic, growing economies but are a \nprerequisite for addressing the huge challenges related \nto access to food, energy, water and sanitation, climate \nchange, fast-paced urbanization and migration. It is not \nenough to merely respond to anticipated challenges; we \nmust take innovative and proactive approaches to seize \nthe opportunities presented by a world of 7 billion \npeople. \n As the countries of Latin American and \nCaribbean region reflect on and respond to those global \nchallenges, we have determined that our own destinies \nare interwoven and that, as developing countries, we \nmust unite and coordinate our efforts in a systematic, \nstructured and deliberative way. We have done just that \n \n \n39 11-51360 \n \nwith the creation of the Community of Latin American \nand Caribbean States. \nAntigua and Barbuda fully endorses and supports the \nobjectives and ideals of the Community and wishes to \nacknowledge the efforts of countries such as Mexico, \nVenezuela, Brazil, Cuba and our sister CARICOM \nmember States for bringing the organization into being. \n As we prepare for an important Summit in \nCaracas, Venezuela, in December, we intend to lay the \nfoundation of a dynamic, responsive and meaningful \ncommunity of nations that share a common history and \nthat have a great deal to gain in our coming together in \nthis way to reshape the agenda, thereby creating a \ngreater balance in the pursuit of happiness, prosperity, \npeace and democracy in our hemisphere. \n Within my own subregion, the eight small \ndeveloping countries that make up the Organization of \nEastern Caribbean States (OECS) have a common \ncurrency union, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union \n(ECCU). We have been adversely affected by the \nglobal financial and economic crisis and we are faced \nwith a protracted recovery. The impact of the global \ncrisis was manifested in steep declines in our tourist \narrivals and expenditures, direct foreign investment \nand remittances. Our real gross domestic product \n(GDP) fell by 5.7 per cent in 2009 and is estimated to \nhave declined by a further 2.2 per cent in 2010, \ninfluenced by declines in value added in construction, \nmanufacturing, agriculture, wholesale and retail, \ntransport and financial intermediation. The crisis has \nalso had a marked impact on our fiscal positions, with \nan accompanying increase in public-sector debt. \n Despite those challenges, there is a positive side. \nOur countries have strong liberal democratic systems \nand the rule of law is upheld. We also have a stable \ncurrency that has been pegged to the United States \ndollar at a rate of 2.7 Eastern Caribbean dollars to \n$1 since 1976. That has been responsible for \ncomparatively low inflation and confidence in the \nmonetary system. In response to the global and \nregional economic and financial crises, ECCU \nmembers have crafted a very strong response to those \nchallenges. We have upgraded our current economic \nintegration arrangements to an economic union status \nand a new treaty to that effect, the revised Treaty of \nBasseterre establishing an OECS Economic Union, was \nratified in January 2011. \n We have put in place a number of institutional \narrangements, which have served us well in addressing \nthe effects of the crisis over the past two years. We \nadopted the ECCU Eight Point Stabilisation and \nGrowth Programme in 2009, aimed at stabilizing and \ntransforming the ECCU economies. As part of the \nfinancial programming, we have set fiscal targets, \nwhich have been approved by the Monetary Council \nand published. The targets are intended to move our \ncountries on a path towards achieving a debt-to-GDP \nratio of 60 per cent by 2020. \n My region remains deeply concerned that AIDS \nhas claimed 30 million lives and orphaned 16 million \nchildren since it was first discovered in 1981. My \nregion remains committed to intensifying national \nefforts to create enabling legal, social and policy \nframeworks to eliminate stigma, discrimination and \nviolence related to HIV and to promote \nnon-discriminatory access to HIV prevention, \ntreatment, care and support. \n As a small developing nation, we can easily \nidentify with the President\u2019s call for enhancing South-\nSouth and triangular cooperation. This, after all, was \nperhaps his signature issue during his tenure as \nChairman of the Committee on South-South \nCooperation. His choice of improving disaster \nprevention and response also resonates with us. The \nincrease in the frequency and intensity of natural and \nman-made disasters and the devastation wrought by \nthem on vulnerable countries such as my own leave us \nwith no choice but to develop ways to build our \ncapacities so that we are better prepared to withstand \nthese disasters. \n In addition to his main theme for this session, we \nalso support the President\u2019s call to focus on United \nNations reform and revitalization so as to ensure that \nour Organization remains relevant, efficient and \neffective and is able to adapt to meeting the ever-\nchanging global challenges. \n His fourth focal area of sustainable development \nand global prosperity is perhaps the one with the most \nscope for collective action. The United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development in June 2012 \nwill certainly provide a forum for the international \ncommunity to, among other things, recommit to \nsustainable development, the eradication of poverty \nand achieving the Millennium Development Goals by \nensuring the balance among the economic, social and \n  \n \n11-51360 40 \n \nenvironmental aspects of sustainable development, \nwith the human being at the centre of our efforts. \n  We can no longer ask whether we can, but we \nneed to give an account of exactly how we will meet \nthe enormous political, economic, humanitarian and \nenvironmental challenges our planet faces. The global \neconomic crisis continues to shake the pillars of our \neconomic system: banks, businesses, Governments, \nprivate sectors and even our own families. Now more \nthan ever, we need a more efficient, effective and \nfocused United Nations that is both transparent and \naccountable to help us address the extraordinary array \nof geopolitical and humanitarian challenges: famine in \nSomalia, the continued crisis in Haiti, the aftershocks \nof the Arab Spring, ongoing conflicts in some countries \nand difficult transitions in others, in addition to the \ndeeper political, economic and environmental \ntransformations that are reshaping our world. \n In an increasingly uncertain world, the world\u2019s \npeople are looking to us here, in this great Hall of the \nUnited Nations, for answers. We are their best hope for \nbuilding a safe, secure and just world. We cannot \nafford to disappoint. We know that rescuing the planet \nwill require us to invest in people, particularly women \nand youth. It will require us to re-emphasize the \nprevention of conflicts and natural disasters alike, and \nit will require us to devote new efforts to assist nations \nin transition from war to peace, autocracy to \ndemocracy, poverty to prosperity. \n Let us show the people of the world that we are \nindeed up to these enormous tasks. Then, and only \nthen, will we be able to say: \u201cYes, we did!\u201d"

        "file_text": "Allow \nme to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the post of \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I have every confidence that his wealth of \nexperience will contribute to the achievement of \nimportant results in our collective work. I would also \nlike to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon \non his reappointment as Secretary-General. \n Two weeks ago the people of Tajikistan \ncelebrated a solemn event in their modern history \u2014 \nthe twentieth anniversary of independence for the \nRepublic of Tajikistan. Despite numerous difficulties \nand challenges, the Republic of Tajikistan, during the \nyears of its independence, has succeeded in achieving \nconsiderable progress and laying a foundation for \ngradual social and economic development. We greatly \nappreciate the contributions made by the United \nNations and its Member States to the establishment and \ndevelopment of an independent, sovereign and \ndemocratic Tajikistan, governed by the rule of law. \n The maintenance of peace and security remains a \ntop priority for the entire international community. For \nthis reason, it is essential that Member States shoulder \ntheir due responsibilities and take the joint measures \nnecessary to bring a speedy halt to wars and conflicts. \nWe welcome the settlement in South Sudan and the \naccession of the Republic of the South Sudan as the \nnew, 193rd Member of the United Nations. Tajikistan \nalso calls on all parties concerned to maximize their \nefforts towards a speedy and full settlement of the \ncontinuing conflict in the Middle East. We support the \nState of Palestine in its efforts to take its well-deserved \nplace as a fully fledged member of the community of \nnations. \n The Government of Tajikistan, aware of its \nresponsibility for addressing social and economic \nissues, has been working consistently to maximize its \nown capacity to attain the Millennium Development \nGoals. Implementation of our national strategy for \ndevelopment of the Republic of Tajikistan is a key \npriority of our Government. Proceeding from \nprinciples of sustainable development for our economy, \nthe Government of Tajikistan has identified three major \ngoals: ensuring energy and food security, and tackling \nthe country\u2019s isolation in terms of communications. \n International trade and direct investments can \nalso help in achieving our development goals. We \nbelieve that the international trade system must remain \nopen, fair, predictable and non-discriminatory. Guided \nby these principles, Tajikistan is currently in active \ntalks on joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). \nIn this regard, we are seeking the support of WTO \nmember States to help speed up the process of \nTajikistan\u2019s entry. \n The problems of climate change and its negative \neffects cannot be overcome without the collective and \n  \n \n11-51390 10 \n \ncoordinated efforts of the entire international \ncommunity. We know that climate change affects fresh \nwater resources as well as exacerbating extreme floods, \nlandslides, droughts and other natural disasters. In \nTajikistan, where about 60 per cent of the water \nresources for the whole of Central Asia originate, more \nthan 35 per cent of glaciers have disappeared in the last \n30 years. The accelerated melting of glaciers creates \nadditional risks for sustainable development and \nregional water, energy and food security. In that regard, \nat the United National Climate Change Conference in \nCopenhagen, the President of Tajikistan put forward a \nproposal to set up an international fund for saving \nglaciers, which could combine the efforts of the \ninternational community in this strategically important \narea. We hope that Member States will support this \ninitiative. \n The comprehensive development of hydroelectricity, \ncombined with other types of renewable energy, will \nenable us not only to increase the capacity of our \nenergy systems but also to enhance their stability and \nincreased efficiency, and considerably decrease \nharmful emissions into the atmosphere. For more than \n10 years, the Republic of Tajikistan has experienced a \nsevere electric power shortage in winter. Owing to a \nlack of other energy sources, it is vital that Tajikistan, \nwhich possesses enormous hydropower potential, begin \nto undertake consistent, comprehensive development of \nits hydro-energy sector. \n Tajikistan is prepared to cooperate closely on all \nissues of the rational use of water and energy resources \nwith every country in the region and with due \nconsideration for common regional interests. This has \nbeen repeatedly emphasized by the President of \nTajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, including in the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s general debate at its sixty-third \nand sixty-fourth sessions, and in other international \nforums on the subject of water. \n As is well known, in the second half of the \ntwentieth century the Central Asian region was \nconfronted with a massive ecological crisis: the drying \nup of the Aral Sea. Wilful disregard for rational, \ncareful and responsible use of natural resources has led \nto the death, for all practical purposes, of the Aral Sea. \nThe enormous number of reservoirs that have been \nbuilt and continue to be built across vast areas \ndownstream of the Aral Sea have also contributed \nconsiderably to its drying up. The total water content \nof those reservoirs and bodies of water represents \n1.5 times the water content of the Aral Sea. \nOvercoming this crisis will require not just massive \ncapital investment in the water sector but also political \nwill and a readiness to implement long-term joint \nmeasures for the rational use of water and energy \nresources throughout the Aral Sea region.  \n It is for this reason that Tajikistan suggested that \nthe United Nations should carry out a comprehensive \nexpert study of water use in Central Asia, including on \nissues related to the effectiveness and rationality of the \nuse of existing reservoirs and an investigation of the \nenvironmental situation in the region as a whole. \n Water is a crucial resource of immense \nimportance to sustainable development and to life on \nour planet. We need to strengthen international and \nregional water cooperation through the effective use of \nexisting mechanisms and instruments. With that in \nmind, Tajikistan called for the proclamation of 2013 as \nthe International Year of Water Cooperation. \n Terrorism is one of the major threats to the \ninternational peace and security. Tajikistan condemns \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We \nbelieve that we must swiftly adopt a universal \nconvention on international terrorism.  \n The prevention of illicit drug trafficking is part of \nthe fight against terrorism. The urgency of this problem \nis a clear indication of the threat it poses to \ninternational stability and security. My country is \nmaking its contribution to the fight against the drug \ntrade. We have set up an anti-drugs body that \ncooperates with other international organizations and \nsimilar services of other States in taking measures to \nfight illicit drug trafficking in our region.  \n Tajikistan reiterates its commitment to the full \nand effective implementation of the Ottawa \nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, \nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and \non Their Destruction. My country unreservedly \nsupports a mine-free Central Asia. We support the \nadoption of measures leading to the demining of mined \nareas and the tackling of other mine-related problems. \n Tajikistan is concerned at the situation in the \nneighbouring country of Afghanistan. It was with great \nsorrow that we learned of the tragic death of the former \nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, \nMr. Burhanuddin Rabbani. He was one of the most \nimportant figures in recent Afghan history and, indeed, \n \n \n11 11-51390 \n \nin the region and the world as a whole. We would like \nto express our heartfelt condolences to the people and \nthe Government of Afghanistan. \n Tajikistan supports the international strategy for a \ncomprehensive peace settlement in Afghanistan and \npost-conflict rehabilitation. We deem it important to \ninvolve Afghanistan in regional integration through \neconomic and trade cooperation with neighbouring \ncountries. I should like to recall the efforts of the \nDushanbe quartet \u2014 Afghanistan, Pakistan, the \nRussian Federation and Tajikistan \u2014 in favour of trade \nand economic cooperation, the fight against terrorism \nand the fight against drugs and organized crime. \n We have opened five bridges on the border \nbetween Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and three \nadditional bridges are being built. This year we also \nconstructed a 220-kilovolt power line linking Tajikistan \nand Afghanistan. We are seeking to address the issue of \nenergy shortages in Afghanistan and in Pakistan by \nbuilding up the hydro-electrical capacity of the Central \nAsian countries through the CASA-1000 project. \n The continued post-conflict economic development \nof Afghanistan is on the agenda of the fifth Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan, to \nbe held next spring in Dushanbe. \n Global problems and regional challenges cannot \nbe addressed without a strengthened United Nations. \nThe process of reforming the United Nations must be \ncarried out in a rational manner, and the renewed \nUnited Nations must become a strong partner that is \nable to react to events across the world and rise to the \nmultiple global challenges that we face in this new age. \n Tajikistan will continue to assist the United \nNations in every possible way in its efforts to build a \npeaceful, secure and healthy planet."

        "file_text": "It \nis an honour for me to participate in this session of the \nGeneral Assembly. We have heard extremely \nsignificant speeches, which have, deservedly, captured \n \n \n17 11-50692 \n \nthe attention of the Assembly. However, as I speak in \nthis lofty forum of the international community, I \nwould like to lay out Mexico\u2019s views, a country that, as \none of the founding States of the United Nations, has \nactively contributed to ensuring that the Organization \nonce again plays its role in promoting peace, justice, \nsecurity, equity and sustainable development among \nnations.  \n The world faces major challenges, about which \nwe have spoken today. We have talked about terrorism, \nwar, peace, climate change and poverty. We know that \nwe are afflicted by other problems, such as the global \neconomic crisis. I would like to refer to just a few of \nthem now, as I am aware that our duty is to strengthen \nthe United Nations, to make it less bureaucratic and to \nonce again turn this into an Organization that is able to \ntackle the pressing challenges of our time. Faced with \nthis reality, Mexico is shouldering its international \nresponsibilities firmly and with determination. \n I would now like to refer to the problem that I \nthink today most afflicts the poorest people in the \nworld. More than 1 billion people, on every continent, \nare living on less than $1.25 a day. This is the problem \nof poverty. Over the past five years, the price of food \nhas risen by more than 50 per cent. Over the past \n12 months, the average increase has been 26 per cent. \nThis means that the poorest families, who allocate most \nof their income to food, have sunk even deeper into \npoverty.  \n This is why poverty has increased around the \nworld. This is why we once again see famine in the \nHorn of Africa, in various nations on that continent, in \nAsia and in Latin America. This is why, in addition to \nthe democratic awakening of certain nations, we have \nseen many people suffering from hunger who have \ntaken to the streets. Hunger is what has, in many cases, \nawakened their awareness of democracy.  \n Why the hike in food prices? That is the first \nquestion we must ask ourselves. It is partly because \ndeveloping countries have grown rapidly, and that is a \ngood thing. China, India and many others have reached \ngrowth rates that allow their people to have greater \naccess to food. What is left to do is to develop the \nnecessary technology to increase our capacity to \nproduce food. \n Secondly, drought and climate change have been \nother contributing factors. We have not truly realized \nthat climate change is a serious threat to humankind as \na whole. In particular, climate change is behind the \ndrought that has restricted food production in recent \nyears.  \n Thirdly, there is financial speculation and \nspeculation on the financial markets. Let me point to \none bit of data. In 1987, financial agents and \ncompanies bought just 7 per cent of food on the world \nmarkets. Today, more than 30 per cent of sales of corn \nand wheat in the world are made by financial \ncompanies. Why do they want corn and wheat? Is it to \ntrade them on various markets or to distribute them to \ncertain regions? Of course not. Trade companies and \ndistributors buy 70 per cent of wheat and corn, but the \nremaining 30 per cent is bought by financial firms with \none specific purpose in mind, namely, speculation. We \nsee how they buy and sell the rights to food with the \nsole intent of driving up market prices, when thousands \nof children are dying of hunger across the various \ncontinents.  \n I am someone who believes in markets, economic \nfreedom and enterprise. But I also know that the time \nhas come for restrictions to be imposed on unbridled \nmarkets, which are also behind world hunger. \n The second challenge that I would like to refer to \nis drug trafficking and international organized crime. \nEveryone is surprised by the dozens, hundreds and \neven thousands of deaths caused by repressive \nauthoritarian regimes, and of course, we also repudiate \nthese. However, we also have to be aware that \norganized crime today is killing more people \u2014 and \nmore young people \u2014 than all of the current dictatorial \nregimes put together. Today, thousands of people \u2014 \ntens of thousands of people in Latin America, in \nparticular between Mexico and the Andes \u2014 are dying \nbecause of criminals. I greet with affection and respect \nmy colleagues from Central and Latin America who are \nhere today. \n Today, the world faces the challenge of \nunscrupulous criminals who have no respect for \nborders and who do grave harm to the citizens of many \nnations. The power of crime is stronger than many \nGovernments, although assuredly not ours. This stems \nfrom two fundamental factors, namely, the exorbitant \nprofits that flow from drug trafficking and unlimited \naccess to the purchase of powerful weapons.  \n With respect to weapons, why do criminals have \nunrestricted access to AK-47s, R-15s and grenade \nlaunchers? In my view, having fiercely fought \n  \n \n11-50692 18 \n \ncriminals and having seized 120,000 weapons in five \nyears, the answer can be summed up in a single word, \nprofits \u2014 the runaway profits of an arms industry that \nsees in every war, whether a civil war in some distant \ncountry or a battle among criminals, an opportunity to \nsell ever more weapons.  \n It is urgent for us to put in place serious controls \nin countries that produce and sell high-power \nweaponry, so as to prevent them from filling the \narsenals of organized crime. The United Nations has its \nwork cut out for it in that regard. The United Nations \nmust continue to promote the draft international arms \ntrade treaty and to prevent weapons from being \ndiverted towards activities that are banned by \ninternational law. \n Moreover, organized crime feeds off the \nastronomical profits produced by the illegal sale of \ndrugs around the world. Unfortunately, the demand for \ndrugs in those markets continues to increase. We must \nrecognize that so long as there are drug consumers \nprepared to pay tens of billions of dollars to maintain \ntheir addictions or preferences, that market will remain \nthe primary financial support for criminal activity.  \n Mexico is doing its part to energetically fight \ncrime in all its manifestations. Today more than ever, \nhowever, drug-consuming countries must undertake \neffective efforts to radically reduce demand. It may be \nargued that this is impossible and that the demand for \ndrugs is continuing to rise, as is the case here in the \nUnited States, where nearly 30 per cent of young \npeople use drugs, and in other parts of the world. \n What is the solution? I can honestly say that even \nif those countries are unable or unwilling to reduce \ntheir demand for drugs, or if they are resigned to the \nfact that it will continue to rise, they still have a moral \nobligation to reduce the huge profits that drug \ntraffickers obtain from that black market. \n It would be best to reduce demand, but failing \nthat, reduce profits. Drug-consuming nations have the \nobligation to find a way to cut that source of endless \neconomic gain, and to seek every possible solution, \nincluding alternative markets that would prevent drug \ntrafficking from being the source of violence and \ndeath, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean \nand various African countries. \n The third challenge to which I would like to refer \nis climate change. Along with Mexico, my Central \nAmerican and Caribbean colleagues are experiencing \never more violent hurricanes that destroy the homes of \nthe poor and cut short many lives. Ironically, just a few \nweeks ago, one of those tropical hurricanes that was \nheaded for our Caribbean coast landed instead on the \nstreets of Manhattan. There are still some who are \nsurprised that there are hurricanes in New York, \nunprecedented droughts in Texas and never before seen \nfloods in Pakistan or Mexico or Colombia or \nGuatemala. Even with all this, they still do not accept \nthe fact of global warming.  \n I can proudly state that we have made progress \nand that Mexico has done its part in moving towards a \nsolution to this problem. We organized the sixteenth \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, in Canc\u00fan, \nwhere important agreements were reached. For \nexample, for the first time, nations agreed within the \nframework of a binding United Nations instrument to \nestablish a global limit on the rise in temperature of \nour planet \u2014 of no more than 2\u00b0 centigrade by the end \nof this century.  \n We also agreed to establish the Green Fund, to \nsupport developing countries in their mitigation and \nadaptation efforts.  \n In addition, we created a mechanism for \ntechnology transfer that incorporates methods for \nreducing emissions caused by deforestation and soil \ndegradation, which will allow the poorest countries to \ncontribute to reducing global warming by preserving \ntheir forests and jungles. In Mexico, more than \n12 million people in indigenous communities, who \nmake their living from jungles and forests and who \nhave had no choice but to destroy them, today use their \nwoodlands in a sustainable way and are paid by the rest \nof society for the environmental service that their trees \nprovide. \n With the approach of the seventeenth Conference \nof the Parties, in Durban, we fear that without \nsufficient political leadership and commitment to its \nown Convention by the United Nations, we may lose \npart of what we have achieved in the battle against \nclimate change. We must advance within the Kyoto \nProtocol, keeping in mind that the provisions of annex 1 \nexpire next year. What will happen with our \nenvironmental obligations in the light of the failure of \nthe most relevant nations to take action? \n \n \n19 11-50692 \n \n The best way to fight climate change is to break \nwith the false argument that we must choose between \neconomic growth and combating climate change. They \nare in fact perfectly compatible. Through actions that \nbuild sustainable development, we can simultaneously \nreduce poverty and climate change. \n Finally, another challenge is the social basis for \nreducing poverty and marginalization. In Mexico we \nestablished a programme for transferring money to the \npoorest of our population, with incentives for mothers \nwho take their children to school or health clinics. The \nprogramme offers an average of $80 monthly to the \nbottom fourth of Mexico\u2019s poorest families, benefiting \nmore than 30 million people and reducing extreme \npoverty in our country by nearly 50 per cent between \n1995 and 2010.  \n Recently, we have focused on guaranteeing the \nhealth of all Mexicans. In five years, we have added \n2,000 new hospitals and clinics, reconstructed \n2,000 more and introduced a national health policy that \nalready covers more than 100,000 people. This allows \nMexico to proudly state today in the United Nations \nthat this year we will achieve universal health \ninsurance, covering doctors, medicines, treatment and \nhospitalization for any Mexican who needs them. That \nachievement, of which we are proud, confirms the fact \nthat Mexico has already achieved almost all the \nMillennium Development Goals to which it committed \nitself. \n Finally, I should now like to discuss a crucial \nissue that has to do with the transformation and \nmodernization of the United Nations. The conflict in \nthe Middle East is a matter that has clearly tested the \ncapacity of the Organization. We are particularly \nconcerned about the stalemate in negotiations between \nIsrael and the Palestinian National Authority. The \nUnited Nations bears the responsibility for making a \nconstructive contribution to the peaceful resolution of \nthis conflict \u2014 one that makes possible the existence \nof two States, reaffirms the recognition of Israel\u2019s right \nto exist and makes the establishment of a Palestinian \nState a reality. Of course, we must bear in mind that \nthis must be a genuine, viable and negotiated solution \nin which legitimate and balanced mediation plays a \nfundamental role. Such a solution must also be \npolitically and economically viable and enable Israel \nand Palestine to truly exist side by side in peace, so \nthat new generations of Israelis and Palestinians can \ntruly know what it is to live together without hatred or \nviolence. \n We should also remember that no solution can be \nfound while either of the sides, explicitly or implicitly, \ndesires the annihilation of the other. In addition, we \nmust make progress on compliance with United \nNations resolutions in order to put an end to policies \nthat we all know are contrary to international law. \n It is also vital that we move forward together in \ntransforming and modernizing the Organization. It is \nan excellent thing that the United Nations building is \nbeing renovated; now we need to modernize the \nOrganization at its core. It must not fail in its \ncommitment to history and humankind. It is time that \nall Member States play our parts in ensuring that the \nOrganization has the strength and viability that it \nneeds, and that it lacks. There have been many \noccasions, for instance, when the United Nations has \nbeen paralysed by the tyranny of consensus, where a \nminority is able to defeat a large majority. Consensus \nmust no longer be seen as the veto power of the \nobstinate; rather it should be understood as the \npossibility of building shared and genuinely legitimate \nsolutions that reflect the will of the majority. \n Keeping the United Nations relevant also \nnecessarily implies the reform of the Security Council, \nwhose rules of participation have not been revised in \nmore than 40 years. Mexico seeks a total reform that \nimproves representation for all Council members while \nat the same time preserving the Council\u2019s capacity to \ntake action and promoting its members\u2019 accountability. \nWe cannot allow the chief supranational body to \nbecome a decision-making centre for the few.  \n Mexico reaffirms its confidence in the United \nNations as a forum that represents the diversity and \nplurality of human beings. Mexico also reiterates that it \nwill continue to be a strategic ally of the Organization \nin the struggle for peace, the war against hunger and \nthe struggle for security and the progress of all peoples \nof the world. \n "

        "file_text": "This year has once \nagain confirmed the importance of the United Nations \nas the truly indispensable multilateral forum for \naddressing today\u2019s global problems. The humanitarian \ncrisis in the Horn of Africa, ecological disasters such \nas Fukushima, political developments like the Arab \nSpring and terrorist attacks such as the assault on the \nUnited Nations building in Abuja last August require \nconcerted action by the United Nations and its Member \nStates. Ten years after 9/11, joint action in the fight \nagainst terrorism continues to remain central on the \nmultilateral agenda. \n In the past nine months, we have witnessed \nmomentous changes in the Arab world that nobody \nexpected when we met one year ago. Pressure for \nchange is driven by the wish of women and men to \nchoose their own fate and to improve their chances for \na better life. These are legitimate demands. An \noverwhelming number of young people were at the \nforefront of this enormous tide, which started in \nTunisia and Egypt. We should pay tribute to their \ncourage. \n In Libya, thousands lost their lives in the struggle \nfor freedom and democracy. In Syria, and to some \nextent in Yemen, the suppression is ongoing. Austria \nstrongly condemns the systematic human rights \nviolations and the violence against peaceful \ndemonstrators. We strongly urge those responsible to \nimmediately stop the bloodshed and to engage in \nmeaningful dialogue and reforms. Austria supports the \nLibyan people in its struggle for freedom. Over \n\u20ac150 million blocked in Austrian bank accounts has \nbeen de-frozen for humanitarian use. Both the Austrian \nGovernment and private sector have provided \nmedicine, relief supplies and desperately needed fuel to \nLibya. \n The international community and the United \nNations have to support and assist the transition \nprocess in the Arab world as the United Nations does \nnow in Libya. This period of change may last for some \ntime and will be full of challenges. Austria welcomes \nall efforts undertaken by Governments in the region for \npeaceful and credible change. We encourage the newly \nempowered authorities to create a constitutional \nframework based on democracy and human rights, in \norder to fulfil their mandate for democratic change \nresponsibly and peacefully. \n The events in the Arab world notwithstanding, we \nmust continue to focus on the Middle East peace \nprocess. The Middle East took centre stage this week \nhere at the General Assembly \u2014 and rightly so. We \nmust build trust and we have to foster the belief among \nIsraelis and Palestinians that a negotiated settlement \ncan be achieved \u2014 a sustainable solution based on two \nStates living side by side in a secure and peaceful \nneighbourhood within mutually recognized borders. \nWe have no choice but to return to direct negotiations \nbetween the two parties. The Quartet, in its statement \nyesterday, has shown a way to do that and has also \nproposed concrete timelines. Austria fully supports the \nQuartet statement. There is no time to lose. \n  \n \n11-51372 26 \n \n Austria welcomes President Al-Nasser\u2019s choice of \ntheme for this year\u2019s general debate. We appreciate \nQatar\u2019s strong track record in that regard.  \n Last year\u2019s tenth anniversary of the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \npeace and security reminded us that the promise of \nwomen\u2019s full and equal participation in all efforts of \nmaintaining peace and security, including in mediation \nprocesses, has not yet come true and that we all need to \nintensify our efforts. \n In that context, let me also mention an Austrian \ncontribution to international mediation efforts. By \ninviting political decision-makers from both Khartoum \nand Juba to Vienna in recent years, Austria has \nmanaged to offer the two sides a platform for \ndiscussion. We are ready to continue to do so. The \nSudan and South Sudan have a shared past and must \nresolve their remaining problems peacefully. \n The United Nations headquarters in Vienna \nserves as a dynamic hub for the promotion of peace, \nsecurity and sustainable development. I am proud to \nannounce that a liaison office of the United Nations \nOffice for Disarmament Affairs will open in Vienna soon. \nOver the past year, the International Anti-Corruption \nAcademy set up its headquarters near Vienna, and the \nVienna Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation \nand an office of the International Peace Institute were \nestablished. \n Austria fully stands behind the campaign \nlaunched by the Secretary-General on Monday to \nachieve universal access to modern energy services. \nWe support doubling the rate of improvement in energy \nefficiency and the share of renewable energy in the \nglobal energy mix by 2030. Austria provides \nsubstantial support to the energy and environment \nefforts undertaken by the United Nations Industrial \nDevelopment Organization. Last June, we hosted the \nVienna Energy Forum, where about 1,400 participants \ndiscussed alternative energy concepts to reach the \nenergy goals of the United Nations. \n The Fukushima nuclear catastrophe should \nbecome a turning point in our approach to nuclear \nsafety. We owe it to future generations to make safety \nconcerns come first when using nuclear power. Austria \ndecided, in 1978, to forgo the use of nuclear energy. \nSome countries have recently adopted a similar course, \nwhich we welcome. \n The last time I spoke at the United Nations, it \nwas during the thematic debate held in April on the \nrule of law and global challenges. That was an \nimportant step in the preparation of the high-level \nmeeting on the rule of law that will take place in \nSeptember 2012. Next year\u2019s meeting will provide an \nimportant opportunity to renew the efforts of both the \nUnited Nations and Member States to promote the rule \nof law. As a medium-sized country and as a strong \nsupporter of multilateralism, Austria attaches particular \nimportance to the rule of law, including at the \ninternational level. The international system can only \nproperly function if it based on clear and predictable \nrules that apply equally to all Member States. \n The promotion and protection of human rights is \na core priority of Austria\u2019s foreign policy. We are proud \nto serve on the Human Rights Council for the period \n2011-2014. For our membership in this body, Austria \nhas identified the following priorities, on which we \nwill take action. \n Austria is firmly committed to respect for \nfreedom of religion and belief. We are deeply troubled \nby recurring attacks against religious minorities in all \nparts of the world and among all religions. To foster \ntolerance, Austria has hosted a number of high-level \ndialogues between religious and secular leaders over \nthe past decade. We think that that has become a new \nand promising field of modern diplomacy, putting the \nemphasis on conflict prevention. \n Various forms of child trafficking and \nexploitation constitute gross violations of children\u2019s \nrights. As a member of the Human Rights Council, \nAustria will work to address that issue and to help \ndevelop counter-strategies. We highly appreciate the \nwork of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms. Radhika \nCoomaraswamy, and we strongly support the renewal \nof her mandate. \n Racism, xenophobia and discrimination on the \ngrounds of ethnic origin, gender, age, sexual \norientation and religious belief are ongoing challenges \nand of concern to all of us. Austria is committed to the \nfight against those abuses, including anti-Semitism. \nTherefore, we will continue to press for action, \nincluding in the framework of the United Nations. We \nwill also take initiatives during our membership in the \nHuman Rights Council to strengthen the protection of \njournalists against all forms of threat and intimidation. \n \n \n27 11-51372 \n \n Austria has a 50-year-long track record of \ncontributing to United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. And we will continue our engagement. We \nrecently decided to deploy 160 Austrian troops to the \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in \naddition to our continued presence in the United \nNations Disengagement Observer Force and the United \nNations Truce Supervision Organization. Through its \nparticipation in UNIFIL, Austria wishes to make an \nactive contribution to the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity not only in Lebanon but in the region as a \nwhole. \n Austria welcomes the positive momentum in \ninternational security policy over the past couple of \nyears. We salute the Secretary-General\u2019s determined \nleadership, including his five-point plan on \ndisarmament. We look forward to continuing our work \nin this positive spirit at the first meeting of the \nPreparatory Committee for the Review Conference on \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons, to be held in Vienna in May of next year. \nWe, and hope for progress with regard to the \nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \nMiddle East. \n Nevertheless, despite our collective efforts, we \nhave not been able to move forward on new  \n \ndisarmament and arms control issues. The multilateral \nmachinery, and in particular the Conference on \nDisarmament, remains deadlocked. Unfortunately, the \nmomentum that we had hoped to generate over the past \nyear has not materialized. Therefore, in Austria\u2019s view, \nthe Conference on Disarmament has not only lost its \ncredibility, it is also risking its legitimacy. Austria will \ntherefore encourage the adoption of a draft resolution, \nat the next session of the First Committee, on how to \nmove multilateral disarmament negotiations forward. \n Austria remains committed to multilateralism and \nto the United Nations as the noblest form of \ninternational cooperation. We will therefore support the \nefforts of the President and the Secretary-General to \nfurther strengthen the Organization in order to better \nenable us to face the challenges of our time."

        "file_text": "I am \nhonoured to take the floor from this rostrum on behalf \nof the President of the Republic, His Excellency \nMr. Denis Sassou Nguesso. \n This past week, in this place, we took part in \nHigh-level Meetings that addressed the major concerns \nat the very heart of the actions of the United Nations \nand those of its Member States: non-communicable \ndisease; the situation in Libya; desertification, land \ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty; the \ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of \nAction on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia \nand Related Intolerance; nuclear safety; and terrorism. \nClearly, the conclusions that we reached at those \nmeetings reflect not only the political will and \ncommitment of Member States to provide collective \nresponses to those concerns, but also corroborate our \nfaith in multilateralism.  \n In unison we have welcomed the Republic of \nSouth Sudan, and we congratulate them on concluding, \nafter many years of patience, the long and laborious \nprocess of negotiation that brought us the 193rd State \nMember of the United Nations. In joining the warm \nwords of welcome expressed by the delegations before \nme, I wish to reiterate the Congo\u2019s support for this \nyoung brother country and to underscore the \ncommitment of my Government to develop close ties \nof friendship and cooperation with it.  \n Since its creation, the United Nations has put a \ngreat deal of effort into the noble endeavour of freeing \npeoples still under the yoke of colonialism and \ndomination. The history of the United Nations is \nintertwined with the emancipation of peoples. The time \nhas therefore come to do justice to the legitimate \naspirations of the Palestinian people. The Congo hopes \nto see a sovereign Palestinian State emerge, master of \nits own fate, in this great universal family, within \nsecure and guaranteed borders and living in peace \nalongside the people of the State of Israel in a spirit of \ngood neighbourliness and cooperation. \n With respect to the situation in Libya, particularly \nas regards the consequences for the subregion, we \nagree that the restoration of peace and security remains \na high priority. For this reason, I wish to express my \nGovernment\u2019s support for the United Nations Support \nMission in Libya. \n In the quest for a peaceful solution to the Libyan \ncrisis, the Congo, together with other African States \nmembers of the Ad Hoc High-level Committee of the \nAfrican Union, urges the authorities of the National \nTransitional Council to meet their commitments, \nparticularly with respect to preserving national unity; \ninvolving all Libyan stakeholders, without exception, \nin rebuilding the country; protecting foreigners, \nparticularly African migrant workers; and opening an \ninclusive political process for ending the crisis.  \n In our immediate neighbourhood, both the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroun will \nhold major elections in several weeks. My delegation \nwould like to see that process take place smoothly, in \ncalm and peace, in order to help democracy take root \nand to strengthen political stability. \n The intolerable situation in the non-State of \nSomalia and the ongoing civil war that has been under \nway for 20 years, along with the unprecedented \nhumanitarian crisis, once again challenge the \ninternational community. We encourage the \nTransitional Federal Government to continue and \nstrengthen its efforts to achieve peace within the \nframework of the Djibouti Agreement, with the \nparticipation of all groups that wish to cooperate, and \nto renounce armed violence. Here, I would like to \ncommend the actions of the African Union Mission to \nSomalia, particularly for having made it possible to \nsecure Mogadishu. \n We welcome the wave of international solidarity \nfor the Horn of Africa. In keeping with this \n \n \n9 11-51398 \n \nmomentum, the Congo has made a contribution for the \nvictims of the drought in Somalia. \n The President has properly placed the role of \nmediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes at the \ncentre of the general debate. For the prevention and \nresolution of conflicts, this is indeed a necessary tool \nthat has proven itself over the years and in all areas.  \n The experience of mediation in Africa since the \nindependence of the African States is replete with \nlessons regarding the role of this mechanism in settling \nthe numerous internal crises or inter-State conflicts that \nour countries have experienced. In the past, the \nOrganization of African Unity used meditation almost \nsystematically. Today, the African Union continues to \nbenefit from it. Furthermore, mediation is consistent \nwith the African culture and tradition of dialogue. It is \nby drawing from the very source of this tradition that \nthe Congo was able to launch a productive internal \ndialogue that enabled it to overcome the socio-political \nturmoil of the 1990s. \n The relevant provisions of the United Nations \nCharter enshrine the obligation of Member States to \nseek, in any dispute,  \n \u201ca solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, \nconciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, \nresort to regional agencies or arrangements, or \nother peaceful means of their own choice\u201d.  \nThese provisions offer a wide range of possibilities \nfrom among which to select the means appropriate to \nbring about a peaceful settlement. \n Today more than ever, the quest for peace by \nnegotiation remains the only way to guarantee lasting \npeace. The threat or use of force should be considered \nonly after having exhausted all possible political \nsolutions. The Security Council should therefore \nstrictly limit the conditions under which the use of \nforce is authorized so as to avoid any manipulation or \ndeterioration of a situation.  \n Similarly, the abuse of the international justice \nsystem, which has become a political weapon targeting \nAfrica in particular, is a dangerous aberration that must \nbe corrected. \n Beyond its main theme, the current session is \nbeing held, as have preceding sessions, at a time in our \nshared history when the United Nations is solidly \nmobilized around its three main pillars of activity, \nnamely, international peace and security, economic \ndevelopment and sustainable development, as well as \nthe related aspects of protecting the environment and \nhuman rights. With respect to the range of challenges \nold and new that the United Nations is expected to \nmeet, it will be viewed as effective and legitimate only \nif it adapts to the new realities of our world. \n United Nations reform is therefore urgent. It must \nbe based on the principles of democracy, justice and \nequality. The position of the African Union on Security \nCouncil reform is well known in this body. The \nreforms will be contingent on the willingness of all \nMember States to make the Organization an institution \nthat embodies modern values and that is open to the \nfuture. \n In order for the United Nations to effectively and \nefficiently fulfil its key role in steering global affairs, \nits Member States must carry out reforms, first to \nrestore the central role of the General Assembly as the \nmost representative deliberative body, and then to \nfoster the participation of more developing countries in \nthe decision-making process.  \n The global challenges identified by heads of State \nand Government at the Millennium Summit, held in \nSeptember 2000, include sustainable development and \nenvironmental protection. These issues have figured \nprominently in international negotiations for many \nyears and influence the implementation of the two \nUnited Nations framework conventions on the \nenvironment.  \n The causes of climate change and their impact on \nhuman life and the environment are well known. \nRegardless of the explanations proffered, \nenvironmental pollution is caused by human activity. \nConsequently, we hope that the negotiations on a post-\nKyoto climate regime will conclude with the adoption, \nat the seventeenth session of the Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, to be held soon in Durban, of an \ninternational instrument that could be opened for \nsignature at the Rio+20 Conference.  \n In Central Africa, the countries of the Congo \nForest Basin, for their part, have made a commitment \nto sustainably manage their forests through \nconservation, forest certification, combating illegal \nlogging, good forest governance, the gradual \nstreamlining of the logging industry and \nimplementation of the process to reduce emissions \n  \n \n11-51398 10 \n \nfrom deforestation and forest degradation in \ndeveloping countries. This effort, which should be \ncontinued, has resulted in very low deforestation rates. \nThis is one of Central Africa\u2019s major contributions to \nglobal efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. The \ninternational community should support and encourage \nit. \n On the initiative of the Republic of the Congo, \nthe first summit on the world\u2019s three tropical forest \necosystems was held in Brazzaville from 29 May to \n3 June. That summit, which brought together the \ncountries of the Amazon, South-East Asia and Congo \nBasins, resulted in the conclusion of a cooperation \nagreement on these three tropical forest ecosystems \nwith the support of United Nations agencies and other \npartners. The agreement is to be signed in Rio de \nJaneiro on the sidelines of the World Summit on \nSustainable Development, to be held in June 2012. In \nthat regard, I wish to express the gratitude of the \nCongolese Government to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his personal support to this initiative. \n As the Assembly is aware, the conservation and \nsustainable management of forests requires substantial \nhuman, material and financial resources, which forest \ndeveloping countries do not have. Those countries are \ndesperately awaiting the release of the \u201cfast start\u201d \nfunds that developed counties announced at \nCopenhagen and the delivery of the innovative, \npredictable and permanent sources of funding agreed at \nCanc\u00fan, as well as technology transfer and capacity-\nbuilding.  \n In mentioning these climate and environmental \nissues, I cannot but think of Mrs. Wangari Maathai, \nwho passed away yesterday. I pay tribute to the \nmemory of this first Nobel Prize-winning woman of \nAfrican politics, who the world will remember as an \navant-garde activist in the fight to protect the \nenvironment. Her commitment to reforestation and \nrestoring biodiversity won her the recognition of the \ncountries of Central Africa, who designated her as a \nGoodwill Ambassador for the Congo Basin Forest. I \nshould like to take this opportunity to express my \ndeepest condolences to the Government and the people \nof Kenya, as well as to the family of the deceased.  \n The events taking place in the Arab world are \nreplete with lessons, as were the enormous changes \nthat transformed the European landscape after the fall \nof the Berlin Wall, in 1989. Everywhere, the hymn of \nfreedom and democracy has resounded. We know that \nthe overthrow of a political regime does not necessarily \nbring freedom and democracy. They must be won and \nnurtured by other victories that cannot be imposed \nfrom without. The world has changed and we must face \nthe facts inherent in these new geopolitical challenges, \nwhich have led to the emergence of new forces on the \ninternational stage. Freedom of expression thrives here, \nin the United Nations. Let democracy not stop on its \nthreshold. The United Nations must be the sanctuary of \nthose who are building the future. A safer, fairer and \nmore prosperous world for all will then emerge. "

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, \nSir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I express the \nsupport of the Cypriot delegation, and I wish you every \nsuccess in fulfilling your duties. \n Over the past six months we have witnessed \nhistoric changes in the wider region of the Middle East \nand North Africa, a region which is very close to \nCyprus. A popular movement has developed in this \nregion with the aim of implementing fundamental \ndemocratic reforms. The reforms are a sovereign affair \nfor the peoples. We hope that they are achieved \npeacefully, without bloodshed and for the benefit of the \npeoples themselves, through political dialogue and \nwith the support of the international community. We, \nthe international community, should offer this support \nwhile respecting the sovereignty and the territorial \nintegrity of the Member States of the United Nations. \n The Republic of Cyprus has experienced \nviolence, and we still suffer from its consequences. \nCyprus is still suffering the effects of the illegal \nTurkish invasion of 1974 and the ongoing occupation. \nThe Cyprus problem is first and foremost a problem of \ninvasion and occupation and the violation of \ninternational law and of the human rights of Cypriot \ncitizens. \n Since the Turkish invasion in 1974, our goal has \nbeen a peaceful resolution of the problem through \nnegotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish \nCypriot communities under the auspices of the \nSecretary-General and on the basis of Security Council \nand General Assembly resolutions on Cyprus. \n Since September 2008, we have undertaken a \nrenewed effort to solve the Cyprus problem, under the \nauspices of the United Nations, through direct \nnegotiations between the leaders of the two \ncommunities, upon our initiative. This effort is focused \non the evolution of the unitary State into a federal one, \nwith two federated units with political equality as \ndefined in relevant Security Council resolutions \u2014 one \nState, with a single sovereignty, a single citizenship \nand a single international personality. This basis was \nreaffirmed by the leaders of the two communities in \n2008, when they agreed on the resumption of \nnegotiations. \n  \n \n11-50865 2 \n \n At the same time, the negotiating process, under \nthe auspices of the United Nations, was agreed. The \nnegotiations are Cypriot-led and Cypriot-owned, as \nwas agreed with the Secretary-General, excluding any \nform of arbitration or artificial time frames. This was \nagreed, bearing in mind recent negative experiences \nthat resulted from unsuccessful attempts to solve the \nproblem. \n We aim to achieve a mutually agreed solution, \nterminating the occupation and the illegal colonization \nby Turkey with settlers in the occupied part of Cyprus. \nWe seek a solution that reunifies the country and its \npeople and creates conditions of lasting peace and \nsecurity on the island. \n An important aspect of the Cyprus problem, of a \nhumanitarian nature, is the issue of missing persons. \nThis issue must be settled regardless of the \ndevelopments in the negotiations. Turkey must fulfil its \nobligations, which stem from the judgments of the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, to allow \nexhumations in military areas and open the archives of \nits army and of other services, in order to determine the \nfate of the missing persons. \n During the first two years of direct negotiations \nbetween the leaders of the two communities, \nconvergences have been reached on various aspects of \nthe Cyprus problem. I regret to note that, lately in \nparticular, the Turkish Cypriot side is backtracking, \neven from convergences that had been found. This \nchange in the stance of the Turkish Cypriot leadership \ndraws on the recent negative and provocative policy of \nTurkey in the region. \n In recent years, the Republic of Cyprus has \nstarted a process for the exploration and potential \nextraction of hydrocarbons within its exclusive \neconomic zone. This was preceded by agreements to \ndelimit the exclusive economic zone with neighbouring \ncountries, always within the framework of international \nlaw, in particular the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea, which the Republic of Cyprus has \nratified. We anticipate that this effort will contribute to \nthe discovery of new energy resources, particularly for \nEurope, and of course for the shared benefit of our \npeople, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike. \n We believe that the possible discovery and \nextraction of hydrocarbons will constitute yet another \nstrong motive for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots \nto expedite a just, functional and viable solution to the \nCyprus problem, so that both communities can enjoy \nthe natural wealth of our country in conditions of \npeace, security and prosperity. I wish to reassure our \nTurkish Cypriot compatriots that, regardless of the \ncircumstances, they would benefit from the possible \ndiscovery and extraction of hydrocarbons. \n Unfortunately, the effort of the Republic of \nCyprus to exercise its sovereign right to exploit its \nmarine wealth is met by threats by Turkey against \nCyprus. Turkish naval manoeuvres in the region of \nCyprus\u2019s exclusive economic zone, where explorations \nare being carried out, are provocative and constitute a \nreal danger of further complications in the region. At \nthe same time, Turkey has continued its illegal actions \nby concluding an agreement with the illegal regime in \nthe occupied area of the Republic of Cyprus in order to \npursue exploration within the exclusive economic zone \nof the Republic of Cyprus. \n From this rostrum, I wish to condemn that illegal \nact, which constitutes a provocation not only for the \nRepublic of Cyprus but for the entire international \ncommunity. Instead of adopting a constructive stance \nin the negotiations for a speedy solution to the Cyprus \nproblem, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership are \ntrying to create tension and new, illegal faits \naccomplis. Ankara\u2019s latest threats directed at a \nEuropean Union (EU) member State come at a time \nwhen Turkey is seeking to open new chapters in its EU \naccession negotiations. \n We wish to express our gratitude to the \npermanent and non-permanent members of the Security \nCouncil, and to the European Union, for the clear \nposition they have taken in defending the sovereign \nrights of the Republic of Cyprus. We call on the \nSecurity Council, the Secretariat and the United \nNations in general to impress upon the Turkish \nleadership that any threat to or violation of the \nsovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus, or any \ncontinuing violation of international and European law, \nwill not be tolerated. \n We are fully committed to continuing to work \ntowards a solution of the Cyprus problem, within the \nagreed framework and on the basis of the agreed \nprocess, as soon as possible. Considering that it is first \nand foremost the Cypriot people who are suffering \nfrom the continuing occupation, it is only natural for us \nto demonstrate goodwill and exert all our efforts to \nreach a just, viable and functional solution to the \n \n \n3 11-50865 \n \nCyprus problem and for the reunification of the State \nand our people. \n We will continue to work to strengthen \ncooperation and trust between Greek and Turkish \nCypriots. A rapprochement of the two communities is \nintegral to our policy. We are continuing with our \ninitiatives aimed at creating the conditions conducive \nto a solution. We recall our proposal for the restitution \nof Famagusta \u2014 a European city, uninhabited since \n1974 as a result of the Turkish occupation \u2014 to its \nlawful inhabitants, under United Nations \nadministration. Our proposal also includes the use of \nthe city\u2019s port by Turkish Cypriots under EU \nsupervision.  \n The implementation of this proposal will \nsignificantly boost negotiations and increase trust \nbetween the two communities; that will also lead to the \nunfreezing of negotiations chapters in Turkey\u2019s EU \naccession process. We recall that the handover of the \nuninhabited area of Famagusta to United Nations \nadministration, and the return of its lawful inhabitants, \nis called for in Security Council resolution 550 (1984), \nwhich Turkey refuses to implement. \n We would like to express our gratitude to the \nUnited Nations, under whose auspices the talks \nbetween the leaders of the two communities are being \ncarried out. We thank the Security Council and the \nSecretary-General himself for his good offices.  \n It is to the Secretary-General\u2019s credit that during \nhis recent meetings with the leaders of the two \ncommunities he persistently sought reaffirmation of the \nbasis for the negotiations from both sides. He has \nreferred specifically to Security Council resolution \n1251 (1999), which provides that the solution to the \nCyprus problem shall be a bi-zonal, bi-communal \nfederation with political equality, as defined in the \nSecurity Council resolutions: a State with a single \nsovereignty, a single citizenship and a single \ninternational personality, excluding any form of union, \nin whole or in part, with any other country as well as \nany form of partition or secession. That is the basis that \nthe United Nations continues to support. \n We are also grateful that the Secretary-General \nhas asked for the reaffirmation of the convergences that \nwere previously agreed on in the framework of the \ntalks. As I have mentioned, the Turkish Cypriot leader \nhas unfortunately retreated from previous agreements \nof fundamental importance. We believe that the only \nway to move forward and reach a solution as soon as \npossible is by upholding the commitments that both \nsides have undertaken in the presence of the Secretary-\nGeneral. Negotiations should be carried out on a clear \nbasis and without backtracking. \n The long-standing dispute in the Middle East is \nnow characterized by frozen negotiations. It is vitally \nimportant that the peace process be resumed on the \nbasis of the principles established by the international \ncommunity in its resolutions. Cyprus supports the \nresumption of negotiations and calls on both sides to \nengage with honesty and goodwill, without creating \nnew faits accomplis.  \n Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve a peaceful, \nstable and secure future within a framework of two \nindependent States. We maintain our principled \nposition for a free and independent Palestinian State, \nnext to the State of Israel, within the 1967 borders.  \n It has been 10 years since the attacks on the \nWorld Trade Center here in New York. Cyprus \ncontinues to support the collective efforts of the \ninternational community, based on international law, to \neliminate international terrorism. We support the \nimplementation of the necessary measures, including \nthe adoption of a comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism. \n Most countries in the world are still in the grip of \nthe global financial crisis. This crisis proves that a new \nmodel of growth must prevail, focused on reducing \nsocial inequalities, eradicating poverty and \nsafeguarding the rights of workers and all other people. \nSpecial emphasis must be given to the fairer \ndistribution of social goods, such as health and \neducation, and to ending the market\u2019s impunity and \nlack of regulation. Emphasis must also be given to \ndealing with social repercussions, such as \nunemployment, delinquency, crime and social \nmarginalization \u2014 problems that cause social tensions \nand conflicts in a number of countries in Europe and \nthe world. \n There can be no doubt that building prosperity \nand global stability on solid foundations cannot be \naccomplished without protecting the environment and \nour planet and promoting the sustainable use of its \nresources.  \n In conclusion, I wish to stress that there is no way \nto deal with the challenges facing humankind today \n  \n \n11-50865 4 \n \nother than collective action. We will succeed only if we \nrealize that our future must be characterized by mutual \nrespect, the fairer distribution and redistribution of \nglobal wealth, social progress and equality, and the \nprevalence of international law and human rights."

        "file_text": "Uganda joins other \ndelegations in congratulating Mr. Al-Nasser on his \nelection to the presidency of this body. My delegation \nhas confidence in his ability to steer our deliberations \nto a successful conclusion. I wish to pay tribute to \nMr. Joseph Deiss for his effective stewardship of the \nwork of the General Assembly during the past session. \n Uganda takes this opportunity to congratulate the \nGovernment and the people of South Sudan on \nattaining statehood and becoming the 193rd Member of \nthe United Nations. Uganda also congratulates Mr. Ban \nKi-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. \n The theme of this session\u2019s general debate, \u201cThe \nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means\u201d, is most appropriate in the light of the \nconflict situations in various parts of the world, \nincluding Africa. When actualized, the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes saves lives and property that \nwould otherwise be lost if force were used. Strategic \ninterventions, such as mediation, are necessary to \nmitigate conflict situations and avert crises that \nthreaten the stability not only of nations, but also of \nentire regions, with adverse effects on development \nand people\u2019s livelihoods. Mediation is a necessary and \nessential tool for the peaceful resolution of conflicts, as \nit is aims to support disputing parties in the process of \nnegotiating a mutual understanding or agreement. \n Uganda has consistently advocated an enhanced \nrole for subregional and regional organizations in \nconflict prevention and resolution. When those \norganizations are involved in mediating disputes, they \nplay a critical role in bringing about sustainable peace \nand security. It was against this background that \nUganda supported and sponsored resolution 65/283 on \nmediation as a tool for the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes. The resolution provides a basis for \nconsolidating normative mediation efforts, reinforcing \nmediation support activities and enhancing the role of \nMember States. \n Uganda has been involved in various initiatives to \nbring peace to the Great Lakes region, the Horn of \nAfrica and the African continent as a whole. Our \ninvolvement included participation in the Burundi \npeace process and in the negotiations, led by the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, on the \nSudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which \nculminated in the birth of a new nation, South Sudan, \nwhich is now participating as an equal partner in the \ncommunity of nations. \n In the case of Somalia, in addition to our \ncontribution to the African Union Mission in Somalia \n(AMISOM), Uganda continues to support the \nengagement of the Somali Transitional Federal \nGovernment with other actors so as to promote \ndialogue in the context of the Djibouti Agreement and \nthe Kampala Accord. In order to consolidate the gains \nrealized on the ground, the United Nations and the rest \nof the international community must urgently \nstrengthen support to Somalia by means of capacity-\nbuilding for the Somali Transitional Federal \nInstitutions; the deployment of the additional \nauthorized 3,000 troops; the approval of a reliable and \npredictable funding mechanism and of the required \naviation assets to AMISOM; and the provision of \nurgent humanitarian relief and assistance to meet the \nbasic needs of the people through quick-impact \nprojects in such areas as health care, water and \nsanitation. \n Our experience in conflict prevention and \nresolution in Africa is that if such efforts are to succeed \nand be sustainable, a number of factors come into play. \nFirst, peace initiatives should be led by the region, with \nstrong support from regional organizations, the United \nNations and other relevant actors. Secondly, it is \nsometimes important to initially give priority to peace \nbefore justice in order to strengthen confidence-\nbuilding between parties. Thirdly, peace and \nreconciliation mechanisms, including transitional all-\ninclusive administrations, need to be established to \nheal the wounds of conflict. Fourthly, post-conflict \nrecovery and reconstruction programmes or projects \nshould be instituted simultaneously so as to \ndemonstrate the benefits of peace dividends. \n Mediation is a worthwhile investment. It costs \nmuch less than other undertakings, such as \npeacekeeping or peace enforcement. In terms of \nbenefits, effective mediation can avert unnecessary \nwars and their attendant consequences, such as the loss \nof life and property, and contribute to building capacity \nfor home-grown solutions to address conflict. The \nmutual confidence that normally results from \nmediation between parties can also be instrumental in \nachieving inclusive political and other arrangements \nfollowing the conclusion of peace agreements. Once \n \n \n19 11-51384 \n \nachieved, such arrangements have a positive impact on \nthe consolidation of peace and security, as well as on \nsustainable post-conflict reconstruction, recovery and \ndevelopment. \n Uganda believes that potential differences \nbetween and within countries are better addressed \nusing home-grown solutions. External influences or \ninterventions do not necessarily offer sustainable \nsolutions to conflict. On the contrary, the latter tend at \ntimes to contribute to a cycle of destabilizing \ntendencies. \n It is therefore important that the involvement of \nthe United Nations, the international community and \nother actors take full account of the interests and \nconcerns of all parties. Hence, there is a need for close \ncoordination, consultation and information-sharing \nwith the parties concerned. The support of the \ninternational community should target areas mutually \nagreed upon with the parties concerned. It is also \nimportant to underscore the fact that, where potential \nconflict situations arise and external support becomes \nnecessary, the international community should provide \na timely, adequate and robust response. \n It is equally necessary to build and strengthen the \nmediation capacities of subregional and regional \norganizations. Specifically, in the case of conflicts in \nAfrica, our preferred solution is peaceful settlement \nthrough mediation, not military intervention. In the \ncase of the Libyan crisis, the African Union (AU) has \ncalled upon the National Transitional Council to \nestablish an all-inclusive transitional Government, as \nproposed in the AU road map for the peaceful \nresolution of the Libyan conflict. \n Uganda would like to make a strong case to this \nAssembly that Africa should be given the chance to \nresolve its conflicts. Africa has strong political will to \nhandle them, and any interventions should be aimed at \nsupporting African initiatives to find peaceful \nsolutions. It is therefore imperative that our partners \nrecognize the existing dispute resolution mechanisms \nof the regional bodies in Africa. I also call upon the \nUnited Nations to fully support Africa in that regard. \n Besides, the role of women in mediation must be \nappreciated and enhanced. Experience has shown that \nwomen can contribute a lot to efforts aimed at peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and at conflict prevention and \nresolution. It is therefore vital that women become \nincreasingly involved in mediation efforts and \nprocesses. \n On the Israeli-Palestinian question, Uganda has \nconsistently called upon the Israeli and the Palestinian \nparties to muster the necessary courage to negotiate \nand reach a peaceful settlement based on a two-State \nsolution, that is, Israel and the State of Palestine living \nside by side peacefully and within secure borders. We \nurge both parties to urgently resume negotiations in \norder to reach a two-State solution that will guarantee \ndurable peace. \n The outcome of this debate should include \npractical and pragmatic actions to address some of the \nchallenges relating to mediation. These include, but are \nnot limited to, issues involved in the adequacy and \npredictability of the requisite resources, capacity-\nbuilding at the national, subregional and regional \nlevels, the involvement of women, and the \nstrengthening of coordination and collaboration in \nmediation efforts and processes."

        "file_text": "It is \na great honour to participate in the General Assembly \nand a great privilege to greet Members on behalf of the \npeople and the Government of Cape Verde.  \n I address the Assembly in the Cape Verdean \nlanguage, the Creole of Cape Verde. I believe this is \nthe first time Cape Verdean Creole is used in United \nNations General Assembly. I do it to share with the \nAssembly this piece of authentic world heritage, born \non the threshold of the fifteenth century. Linguistic \nexperts consider it the oldest Creole of Euro-African \norigin and the oldest within the Atlantic context.  \n I use it also because language is culture, history \nand memory. All languages are expressions of \nthoughts, knowledge and practices. Languages are no \ndoubt an expression of civilization. Therefore, \nspeaking in the Creole of Cape Verde, in this most \nimportant Hall, at a meeting of heads of State and \nGovernment, is a reference to our conviction that the \nCreole identity is of anthropological value for all \nhumanity. It is a way of highlighting our Cape \nVerdeanship: our soul and the way of being, the ethos \nand pathos of Cape Verde, which is the result of the \nintersection of various peoples of the world. The \nlanguage is, in and of itself, a synthesis of the meeting \nof civilizations. By using it, I also pay vibrant tribute \nto Aristides Pereira, the first President of Cape Verde \nand a great African fighter for freedom and human \ndignity, who recently passed away. \n The central theme of this Assembly session \u2014 the \nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means \u2014 is a crucial and imperative theme \nfor the world. It reflects the identity, the way of being \nand lifestyle of Cape Verdeans. As subscribers to the \npurposes and principles of the United Nations, we \nbelieve that peace and human rights are the key factors \nin the construction of sovereignty, democratic rule of \nlaw and sustainable development. Therefore, mediators \nare required to position and approach matters within \nthe universal matrix of peace and human rights as the \nhighest priorities of all States Members of the United \nNations.  \n  \n \n11-51372 2 \n \n In addition, we consider it crucial to take an \napproach focused on the prevention and control of \nnon-communicable diseases worldwide, especially in \nthe context of the challenges faced by developing \ncountries. \n Let me offer a few special words regarding the \ndevelopment of themes such as desertification, land \ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty eradication in preparation for \nthe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, scheduled for June 2012, which we \nstrongly and actively support.  \n One of the most decisive actions taken by \nindependent Cape Verde, soon after 1975, was \nreforestation, along with orographic correction and the \nmobilization of water. As a small island developing \nState at the crossroads of two large regions \u2014 the \nSahel and Macaronesia \u2014 and suffering the effects of \nthe most stringent climatic randomness of one region \nand the oceanic isolation of the other, Cape Verde is \nconscious of the importance of the green as well as the \nblue economy to the objective of sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n We need the United Nations to work out our part \nin preventing climate change and food and water \nshortages. We count on the United Nations and all \ncountries of this great General Assembly to converge \nboth bilaterally and multilaterally towards the green \neconomy and sustainable development. Therefore, in \nCape Verde there is an ongoing and ambitious \nprogramme for covering 50 per cent of national energy \nneeds through renewable sources by 2020. \n Despite remarkable and positive changes \u2014 some \nof which have been internationally recognized, such as \nour graduation to middle-income country status and \nbeing on the path towards full achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals \u2014 I would still like to \ntake this opportunity to better acquaint the General \nAssembly with my country. \n Cape Verde, with its ten islands in the middle of \nthe Atlantic, strategically positioned in the corridor and \nthe cross-Atlantic flow, is not only a strong partner for \nglobal security, geostrategic interests and world trade, \nbut is also an active and useful member of the \ninternational community in the fight against trafficking \nand related crime. The vast oceanic region of Cape \nVerde is an important space for security in the \npromotion of regional peace and prosperity and in the \naffirmation of an international coalition to fight illicit \ntransnational crime. \n Some may wonder, \u201cWhat country is this?\u201d Some \nthink of it as the nation of Amilcar Cabral; others see it \nas the country of Cesaria Evora. Cape Verde is a land \nthat was once an important entrep\u00f4t and trans-shipment \nbase for the African slave trade, for both Europe and \nthe Americas. Its oldest city \u2014 Ribeira Grande, or the \nCidade Velha \u2014 was named a World Heritage by \nUNESCO in 2009. \n Cape Verde is a State that encourages other States \nto remember, through memory, history and human \nrights, the international slave routes, just as we \nremember the Holocaust, another of the heights of \nhuman barbarism. In Cape Verde we can defy our \nlusophone partners in the Community of Portuguese-\nspeaking Countries and our African partners and the \nentire world to reaffirm our commitment against \nbarbarism, dictatorship, colonialism and disrespect for \nhuman rights through the promotion of the candidacy \nof the Tarrafal concentration camp on the island of \nSantiago as a World Heritage site. \n Those who know us know that we are a country \nconcerned with development. We do not settle for \nbeing middle-income country. We need the partnership \nwith the international community to fulfil our destiny. \n In Cape Verde\u2019s transformational agenda, we \nhave identified five pillars of our country\u2019s growth and \npoverty reduction strategy: promotion of effective \ngovernance, strengthening human development, \nconfronting the structural and social challenges arising \nfrom competitiveness, and investment in infrastructure \nfor improving social cohesion. \n Cape Verde is developing a foreign policy that \nfavours democracy, justice, peace, cooperation and \nsustainable development. We look at the planet as the \nhome of all, respecting the sovereignty and will of the \npeople while emphasizing the global convergence in \nthe core of humankind. We are therefore concerned \nabout hunger in the Horn of Africa. We are concerned \nthat thousands of children die in Africa every day from \nhunger. I am concerned that that does not motivate a \nstronger international intervention, since the \ndictatorship of hunger is the worst of dictatorships.  \n We urge the United Nations to be more effective \nand to make a concerted effort to reverse the image of \nthat human tragedy in East Africa. We must therefore \n \n \n3 11-51372 \n \neradicate the geopolitics of hunger. We all need to take \nthe paradigm of zero hunger in the world. \n We are also concerned about wars and tensions \nthat thrive a little everywhere but are now more \nlocalized and of more intense in Africa, the Middle \nEast and Asia \u2014 to the delight of the dealers in misery, \nthose who invest in the war industry and in the \nsuffering of millions of human beings, especially \nchildren, women and the elderly. We must reach a \nglobal consensus that security, peace and stability arise \nfrom the economic and social development of States \nand peoples. We must deconstruct war, conflict and \ntension between countries and peoples and ensure the \ncommitment of the sixty-sixth session of the General \nAssembly towards that noble goal. We must reiterate \nthat mediation is essential to settle disputes, whether in \nAfrica or in the rest of the world. \n The global economic crisis is acute. In large \ncountries it shows signs of settling and in poor \ncountries it is amplified. If the crisis is global, it \nrequires global responses against recessionary policies, \nsuch as the protection of domestic markets, and the war \nagainst unfairly priced imports. It also requires global \npositions that converge towards social inclusion as a \nway to reduce the impact of the economic crisis. \n We reiterate our firm position of respect for \ninternational laws, the principles of non-interference in \ninternal affairs and the sovereignty of peoples and \nnations. We do not support double standards for similar \ncases, as if peoples and nations were not equal and \ndeserving of the same treatment, as stated in the United \nNations Charter. \n Before concluding, I must emphasize our position \nin favour of expanding the reform model of global \ngovernance by the United Nations, allowing, among \nthe many benefits, small States to have a greater voice \nin the decision-making process of the international \nsystem. Cape Verde unequivocally supports an increase \nin the number of permanent members of the Security \nCouncil, in the belief that the world is no longer as it \nwas at the end of the Second World War, nor does it \nresemble that of the end of the Cold War."

        "file_text": "As we say in Maori, \nto all peoples and to all voices, greetings, greetings, \ngreetings to all. \n I speak at the end of a period of intense United \nNations dialogue and engagement. This year\u2019s general \ndebate provides unparalleled opportunities to reaffirm \nthe unique multilateral role of the United Nations. And \nthere has been much to debate. The events set in \nmotion by a single Tunisian street vendor have \ntransformed much of the Middle East and North Africa. \nPeople have displayed extraordinary courage in \nclaiming their rights and freedoms. The transition from \ndictatorship to democracy will not be easy; it will not \nbe quick; but it must be achieved. \n For others, the struggle continues. We still look \nfor change in Yemen; we still look for change in Syria. \nOther challenges are highlighted by this debate. We \nheard from the President of South Africa and others \nhow the global community must move swiftly to avert \nhumanitarian disaster in the Horn of Africa. \n We heard from the President of Nigeria how \nterror networks threaten international peace and \nsecurity, and from the President of Tanzania about \ngrowing piracy on Africa\u2019s eastern coast, from Somalia \nto Mozambique. We heard calls from the Indonesian \nForeign Minister for bold measures to avert a renewed \nglobal financial crisis, and we heard from the President \nof Brazil about the challenge of empowering women to \nparticipate in political decision-making. \n As this debate has demonstrated, much more \nremains to be done. Lives have also been wrenched by \nnatural disasters in many countries, including my own. \nOn 22 February 2011, we experienced what my Prime \nMinister called New Zealand\u2019s darkest day. An \nearthquake struck Christchurch, our second-largest \ncity. A total of 181 people were killed, a loss we share \nwith 15 other countries whose citizens also died. We \nwere humbled by the support we received, and, once \nagain, I thank those who gave that help. \n  \n \n11-51681 32 \n \n Despite that disaster and the literally thousands of \naftershocks that have followed, New Zealanders remain \nresilient and optimistic. Christchurch is being rebuilt. \nOur economy is bouncing back and the country is \nreturning to normal, not least by currently hosting the \nRugby World Cup, a celebration of a game we love, in \nthe country we love.  \n Despite some cause for economic optimism, the \nevents of just the past week suggest that the world still \nfaces what we have long feared: a second and even \nmore disastrous decline into a double-dip recession. \nWe do not relish the prospect of being dragged into \nanother recession that is not of our own making. We \ncaution others larger than ourselves against repeating \nthe mistakes of the 1930s, when autarkic protectionism \nonly deepened the Depression and led to war. \n Instead, a successful conclusion of the Doha \nRound is one of the keys to prosperity, particularly for \nthose of the global South. The February Christchurch \nearthquake was followed by the devastation wrought \non our close friend and neighbour Japan. I reiterate our \nheartfelt sympathy to Japan, so steadfast in its support \nfor New Zealand in our time of need. Those disasters, \nand others elsewhere, reinforced the importance of \neffective disaster preparedness, response and recovery. \n New Zealand will work with the United Nations, \nnon-governmental organizations and international \nagencies so that the lessons learned from Christchurch \nare shared with others so that those in regions as \nvulnerable as ours can be better prepared. Indeed, in \nthose regions, disaster preparedness is no desktop \nexercise; it is a matter of survival. \n Likewise, for our Pacific neighbours, another \nhigh risk, climate change, is no abstract threat, \nconfined to thousands of pages of reports and esoteric \ndebate; it is a fundamental question of existence. For \nthe Pacific, climate change is a grave and present threat \nto livelihoods, security and well-being. \n The Secretary-General experienced those \nchallenges first-hand when he visited several Pacific \nStates, including one post-conflict society, and another \nwhose people see, on a daily basis, the dangers of \nrising oceans. He experienced real vulnerability when \nhe saw that his hotel room, in addition to the towels \nand the telephone, was equipped with a lifejacket. And \nhe saw the impact of rising oceans on the viability and \nsurvival of many communities when his plane had to \nbe \u201cwheels up\u201d from the country\u2019s airport \u2014 its major \nlink with the world \u2014 before the tide came in. \n Much more of that, and whole populations will be \non the move, as they will be in other regions of the \nworld as well, and that will have with implications for \nregional and international stability and security. Faced \nwith that, it is self-evident that all relevant \ninternational forums, including the Security Council, \nmust play their part in addressing the challenge. That \nmeans taking urgent and effective action on emissions \nreduction. It means strengthening adaptation in \ndeveloping countries, particularly the most vulnerable. \nAnd it means acknowledging and planning for the \nsecurity implications before they become threats to \nregional and international security. \n This year\u2019s Durban meeting must set us on the \nroad to full implementation of the Cancun agreements. \nNew Zealand is committed, both through the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nnegotiations and its active assistance in the Pacific and \nelsewhere, to integrate adaptation and mitigation \nmeasures into its development activities. \n New Zealand also initiated the Global Research \nAlliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. Supported \nby more than 30 countries, the Alliance seeks to ensure \nthat reducing agricultural emissions does not \ncompromise global food security. \n Increased agricultural productivity \u2014 the ability \nof many countries to feed themselves \u2014 is one of the \ngreat achievements of recent decades. Constraining \nagricultural production would put much of the world\u2019s \npopulation at risk, and no country will do that. We \nmust therefore maintain investment in agricultural \nresearch, so that productivity and efficiency gains can \ncontinue, but with fewer greenhouse-gas emissions. \nThat is what the Global Alliance is all about.  \n New Zealand takes pride in its diversity. We are \nindigenous Maori; we are European; and we are the \nmany peoples from the Asia-Pacific region and \nelsewhere who now call New Zealand home. We are \nalso proud to be part of the Pacific Islands Forum, the \nforemost regional body. For 40 years, it has been \ncentral to the region\u2019s efforts to address its own \nproblems, be they the special development challenges \nof small, isolated, vulnerable island States, or halting \nand healing the impacts of violent conflict. It has done \nthat in the time-honoured Pacific way, through \n \n \n33 11-51681 \n \nrespectful dialogue and cooperation and then through \njoint action. \n Three weeks ago, at the Forum\u2019s fortieth \nanniversary meeting in Auckland, Pacific leaders \nhonoured that legacy by agreeing on measures aimed at \nconverting Pacific potential into Pacific prosperity. \n The themes of their discussions will resonate in \nother regions: strong, sustainable economic growth, \nprotecting vulnerable populations and ensuring that \nthey are healthy and educated and that they can have \nlong lives. \n A key focus of that meeting was the alarming \nincidence of non-communicable diseases, a scourge \nthat is rapidly encircling the globe. Almost half of all \nNew Zealand deaths relate to cancer and heart disease, \nbut the situation is even more critical in many Pacific \nisland countries, where diabetes in particular \napproaches epidemic proportions. We thank those who \nbrought that cause here to the United Nations, \nparticularly the countries members of the Caribbean \nCommunity. \n With the 2012 United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development (Rio+20) very much in mind, \nPacific Forum leaders also focused on sustainable \ndevelopment. Rio+20 will be an opportunity to assess \nthe progress made since the 1992 Conference, take its \nagenda forward and highlight best practices. For \nexample, New Zealand\u2019s aid programme includes \nenergy, agriculture and tourism initiatives that promote \nsustainable development. \n Pacific peoples were navigating their ocean, the \nworld\u2019s largest, at a time when others were still \nconfined to their coastal waters. New Zealand Maori \ncall the Pacific the ocean guarded by the god Kiwa. \nOur region is uniquely dependent on its ocean. For \nthose who call the Pacific home, the \u201cgreen economy\u201d \nis in reality a blue economy. Our ocean underpins \nlivelihoods, food security and economic development. \nThat is why Pacific leaders have focused on ensuring \nits sustainable development, management and \nconservation. That is why they made addressing \nacidification, pollution and illegal, unreported and \nunregulated fishing urgent matters. That is why our \nleaders want us to work towards integrated ocean \nmanagement, with our own Pacific Oceanscape \nframework as a very good model. And that is why they \ncalled for Rio+20 to recognize the Pacific\u2019s economic \nand environmental significance, and its contribution to \nsustainable development. At Rio+20, we will seek the \nsupport of the United Nations for that blue economy. \n We work to protect the health of people and their \nenvironment, but we must also enhance collective \nsecurity by advancing the disarmament agenda. Over \nthe coming year, we must focus on the full \nimplementation of the action plan agreed at the 2010 \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. As coordinator \nfor the New Agenda Coalition, a group of non-nuclear-\nweapon States committed to a nuclear-weapon-free \nworld, New Zealand will soon introduce a draft \nresolution highlighting the work that will be required \nto achieve its implementation during the coming \nreview cycle of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons. We commend that draft resolution \nfor the Assembly\u2019s consideration. \n There have been gains over the past year with \nrespect to conventional disarmament, but we have yet \nto see the results of those achievements. There has \nbeen pleasing progress towards an arms trade treaty, \nbut hard work remains. Next year\u2019s Diplomatic \nConference must deliver a treaty establishing the \nhighest possible common international standards for \nconventional arms transfers. \n We must also maintain focus on small arms and \nlight weapons, which for many regions are their \nweapons of mass destruction. The year 2011 marks the \ntenth anniversary of the United Nations Programme of \nAction to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \nAspects. There has been much to celebrate, including \nthe first Open-Ended Meeting of Governmental Experts \non the implementation of the Programme of Action, \nwhich I had the honour of chairing in May. But next \nyear\u2019s Review Conference must work to ensure that the \nProgramme delivers on its potential for keeping \ncommunities safe from such weapons. \n To deal with all of that, we need a strong, nimble \nand effective United Nations, and we need a Security \nCouncil that reflects geopolitical realities \u2014 realities \nthat have changed since 1945. Today, some States \nmight credibly seek a fuller, longer-term Council role. \nNew Zealand supports change that acknowledges those \nrealities. \n But most United Nations Members are not major \nor emerging Powers, they are small States. They too \nare crucial to the universality and legitimacy of the \n  \n \n11-51681 34 \n \nUnited Nations; they too must contribute at the Council \ntable. Let me put it simply: if we reform the Security \nCouncil to provide a fuller, longer-term role for \nemerging Powers, we must also ensure a role for small \nStates. Speaking as a small State, I say that we are the \nUnited Nations. And so we agreed with the Minister for \nForeign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago when he said \nthat the smallness of a country is not a deterrent to the \nrealization of big dreams (see ), and with \nthe Prime Minister of Cape Verde, who told us that \nsmall States must have a greater voice in international \ndecision-making (see ). \n There are real risks if we cannot achieve genuine \nSecurity Council reform. Emerging Powers will be \ndenied a role consistent with their global significance, \nand small States will continue to be squeezed out of \npositions of responsibility. It is in everyone\u2019s interests \nthat the Security Council be more representative. As \nwe saw earlier this year with respect to Libya, the \nCouncil is an extraordinarily powerful instrument for \nmaintaining international peace and security. But with \nextraordinary power comes extraordinary responsibility \u2014 \nresponsibility that must be exercised with regard for the \nviews of all countries, large and small. \n The Council must also build on its partnerships \nwith regional groups, such as the African Union, which \nincreasingly plays a critical role in maintaining \nregional and global peace and security. Recognizing \nthe importance of closer relations with Africa, we are \nencouraging New Zealand investment in and trade with \nAfrica, supporting peace and security and providing \ndevelopment assistance. Last week, we increased our \ndiplomatic engagement by appointing a dedicated \nambassador to the African Union and the Federal \nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia. \n New Zealand is proud of its history of active \ncontribution right across the United Nations agenda. \nWe have a strong record as an independent and  \n \nprincipled voice advocating collective security and the \nrule of law. We take an even-handed approach to \nsecurity issues, as has been shown by our voting record \nand our tangible contributions to peace processes. We \ntake seriously our international responsibilities. \n That is why, in 2004, we announced that we \nwould seek a non-permanent Security Council seat for \nthe 2015-2016 term. Nearly 20 years have passed since \nNew Zealand\u2019s last time on the Council. The time is \nright for us to again bring the fresh, independent \nperspective of a small Asia-Pacific country to the \nCouncil. That candidature, which I confirm here today, \nis based on the belief that States, large and small, have \na place at the Council table. Modern New Zealand was \nfounded on a compact, a treaty-based partnership with \nits indigenous Maori people. That, and our diversity, \nmeans a unique history and perspective on promoting \ntolerance and conflict resolution; a perspective that we \nhave previously brought, to good effect, to the Council \ntable, and which we will bring again. \n For the United Nations, 2011 has been a truly \nhistoric year. The Organization has quickly responded \nto change in the Middle East and North Africa. It \nstands ready to provide post-conflict support, and not \njust in Libya. It has been critical to relief in the Horn \nof Africa. Its essential role in State recognition has \nbeen at global centre stage. Even the most cynical, the \nmost jaded, have had to relearn that the United Nations \nis at the epicentre of much that happens, and much that \nmatters. We need the United Nations. We need it to \naddress the woes of the world and to consolidate its \nsuccesses. Its fundamental importance stems from its \nuniversality, its legitimacy and its mechanisms to \nconfront challenges. Its effectiveness depends on its \nability to adapt as those challenges emerge and on its \nability to address them together. Member States, large \nand small, come together in that collective endeavour. \nNew Zealand, as always, stands ready to play its part."

        "file_text": "I am pleased \nto congratulate the brotherly State of Qatar and \nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser personally on \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-six session. I am confident that Mr. Al-Nasser\u2019s \nwise leadership of the Assembly\u2019s proceedings will \nhelp us fulfil our ambitions and aspirations. I also \ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on his \nre-election to his second term as he continues to strive \nto realize the purposes and principles of the Charter. \n \n \n53 11-51360 \n \n I proudly stand before the Assembly today \nrepresenting Egypt in a new era and with a new face as \nit leaves behind a fading era for one whose features are \njust emerging, and as it embarks on a new phase \nregarded by all Egyptians as auspicious and full of \npromise. The Egyptian people came out en masse on \n25 January calling for democratic reforms and \nstrengthened respect for human rights, fundamental \nfreedoms and social justice. The Egyptian people \nwanted to plant the seeds of a brighter future deep in \nthe land of reality, for their sake and for the benefit of \ntheir future generations. \n The people obtained what they sought. They were \nable to impose their word and enforce their will. They \nwere backed by the understanding and support of the \nEgyptian armed forces, which truly exemplify genuine \npatriotism and unity with the people of our nation. The \nstance of our armed forces will be remembered by \nhistory. It is consistent with their doctrine that they are \nguardians of the nation, not of a specific political \nregime, and with an institution that is first and \nforemost loyal to the people, who for their part rallied \naround their armed forces and expressed their \nappreciation.  \n That ideal situation was made possible by \ncircumstances that can rarely be repeated and that \nenabled the Egyptians to alter the face of their country \nin a historic and wonderful way. Egyptians wanted to \nrapidly catch up with other countries that had made \ngreat strides in achieving political pluralism and the \nalternation of power, in upholding and applying the \nrule of law, in relentlessly fighting corruption in its \nvarious forms, and in providing equal opportunities to \ntheir youth to fulfil their ambitions and aspirations to \ndecent lives. \n I am addressing the Assembly today as Egypt \nmoves forward, determined to complete the transitional \nphase that arose from that remarkable transformative \nchange. Over the past few months, and indeed since the \nrevolution took place, Egypt has witnessed a new \ninternal dynamic and a wide national debate involving \nall segments of society and covering all issues on the \nnational agenda. Foremost on that agenda are the \ndrafting of a new constitution and the organization of \nthe upcoming legislative and presidential elections. \nThose steps will increase the prospects of success of \nthe transitional phase and launch a sound political \nprocess commensurate with the aspirations of the \npeople and Egypt\u2019s unique standing in the region and \nworldwide. It is a process that will culminate in the \nhanding of power to an elected civilian authority. \n Egypt is honoured to have held the chairmanship \nof the Non-Aligned Movement since July 2009. The \nstart of this session of the General Assembly coincides \nwith the commemoration of the fiftieth year since the \nfirst summit of the Movement took place, and to \ncelebrate its significant contributions to enhancing our \ninternational efforts to preserve international peace and \nsecurity and achieve development for the peoples of \nthe world in a changing international environment and \nin the face of multiple challenges. The commemoration \ncomes after a series of important events organized by \nthe Movement to promote the greater involvement of \ndeveloping countries in the governance of international \ninstitutions and to ensure fair participation in the \nprocess of international norms-setting and decision-\nmaking in the political, economic and social fields. \n On that basis and to that end, the Egyptian \nchairmanship of the Movement has undertaken \nnumerous activities to strengthen the Movement\u2019s \ncapacity to respond effectively to new and ongoing \ninternational changes. The Movement has also played a \nvital role in coordinating the positions of its member \nStates on various issues on the international agenda, \nincluding those related to disarmament, collective \nsecurity, the reform of the United Nations, and the \npromotion of international ideals and values of \ndemocracy and respect for human rights. \n During its chairmanship of the Movement, Egypt \nhas sought to reinforce the Joint Coordinating \nCommittee of the Group of 77 and China. In the light \nof an international work agenda loaded with issues, \nideas and initiatives, we resolved to restore the issue of \ndevelopment in its various dimensions as the top \npriority of the United Nations, and together we adopted \na number of important initiatives in the fields of food \nsecurity, the empowerment of women and the fight \nagainst human trafficking. We will pursue those efforts \nuntil we hand over the chairmanship of the Movement \nin the summer of 2012 to the country chairing it next. \n I reiterate here today the support of the \nNon-Aligned Movement for the historic struggle of the \nbrotherly Palestinian people to regain their legitimate \nrights, for the efforts made towards declaring the \nestablishment of the independent State of Palestine, \nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, and for its admission \nas a full Member of the United Nations. I also call on \n  \n \n11-51360 54 \n \nthe countries that have not yet recognized the State of \nPalestine to do so as a contribution to the pursuit of a \njust, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the \nMiddle East conflict based on the two-State solution. \n The Non-Aligned Movement believes that there \nis a pressing need for a comprehensive and substantial \nreform of the United Nations in order to strengthen its \nability to respond positively to international \nchallenges, to meet to the aspirations of peoples, and to \naddress the radical changes that have altered the shape \nand composition of the international community so that \nthe United Nations may become a true reflection of the \nrealities of today\u2019s world. \n Such reform will not be achieved unless the \nSecurity Council is reformed and becomes more \nrepresentative, more transparent and more reflective of \nthe democratic nature of global action. Inevitably, \nmajor steps must be taken to end the monopoly of \npermanent members over the decision-making process \nin the Council and to put an end to the historical \ninjustice inflicted on Africa as a result of its \nnon-representation in the permanent membership \ncategory, as well as its inadequate representation in the \nnon-permanent membership category, despite Member \nStates\u2019 growing support for the African position. In the \nsame context, States members of the Non-Aligned \nMovement demand that efforts be continued to \nrevitalize the role of the General Assembly and to \nstrengthen the role of the Economic and Social \nCouncil. \n The States members of the Non-Aligned \nMovement also reaffirm the need for the international \ncommunity to support the work of developing countries \nto implement their development plans aimed at \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals, through \nan enabling international climate that bolsters efforts to \nrealize comprehensive economic and social \ndevelopment, and the fulfilment by all developed \ncountries of their financing for development \ncommitments. It must also support their efforts to \nachieve more balanced international economic \nrelations and to establish a fairer international trade \nsystem that takes into account the development needs \nof developing countries. \n We feel nothing but deep sorrow every time we \nrealize that, for decades, grave historic injustice has \nbeen inflicted on a people while, to date, the entire \nworld has failed to end it. The just question of \nPalestine endures after two entire decades of fruitless \nnegotiations without the desired settlement. To this \nday, the Palestinian people remain deprived of their \nlegitimate fundamental rights, including their rights to \nfreedom, independence and to establish their own \nsovereign State on the basis of the 1967 borders, with \nEast Jerusalem as its capital. \n That is the very State for which the Palestinian \nPresident yesterday submitted a request for \nmembership of the United Nations (A/66/371, annex), \nafter serious and just efforts towards a final settlement \nhad stalled and any chance of achieving significant \nprogress in the negotiating process had dwindled, in \nparticular since the other party insists on keeping the \nnegotiating process open forever. Yesterday, we saw \nthe Quartet fail yet again to come up with a balanced \nvision to achieve the goal that we all know and \napprove of, yet differ on how to realize. \n It is utterly absurd to carry on talking about a \npeace process, while Israel continues, in all comfort \nand complete disregard for the objections of the \ncountries of the world, to construct settlements on the \nPalestinian territories in the West Bank, altering the \nfeatures of occupied East Jerusalem, using violence \nagainst civilians and continuing its blockade of Gaza, \nin violation of the provisions of international law.  \n Regrettably, anyone with a sense of justice \nfollowing the situation will see in Israel\u2019s actions the \nembodiment of its continuing refusal to admit that the \nonly way to achieve its security is by reaching a just \nsettlement with the Palestinians through serious \nnegotiations based on clear parameters and terms of \nreference and a specific time frame. What is urgently \nneeded now is to intensify all our efforts in order to put \nan end to the conflict. \n Egypt has been and will remain committed to the \ngoal of achieving the just and comprehensive peace \nthat it initiated in the Middle East, and will continue to \nactively support it. Egypt will continue its efforts to \nend the Israeli occupation of the occupied Palestinian \nterritories and to resolve all final-status issues within a \nspecific, agreed and internationally guaranteed time \nframe. Egypt will also maintain its efforts to capitalize \non the successes achieved in Cairo through the signing \nof the Palestinian reconciliation agreement, thereby \nstrengthening Palestinian unity and efforts to achieve \npeace. \n \n \n55 11-51360 \n \n Egypt welcomes the presence of the Republic of \nSouth Sudan among us today as a State Member of the \nUnited Nations. We hope that that nascent State will \nplay a tangible role in regional stability, and that it will \nmake steady progress on the road to development and \ninstitution-building. At the same time, we commend \nthe Sudan for its commitment to implementing the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement and to respecting the \nwill of the people of the South for an independent \nState.  \n However, even though last year witnessed \nsignificant cooperation between the two sides, \noutstanding issues remain unsettled. They should be \nresolved within a framework of cooperation and \ngoodwill, which requires the formation of a genuine \npartnership to examine how to address such issues. It is \nno secret that the Sudan and South Sudan still look \nforward to the support of the international community \nfor their development and reconstruction efforts so that \nthe Sudan can achieve stability and development \nthroughout its territory, within the context of its unity \nand territorial integrity, and so that South Sudan can \nbuild its State and institutions. On that basis, I reiterate \nEgypt\u2019s resolve to continue supporting both countries \nat all levels. \n On behalf of Egypt, I would also like to pay a \ndeserved tribute to the revolution of the sisterly State \nof Tunisia, which expedited dawn of the Arab Spring. I \nalso express our solidarity with the brotherly people of \nLibya, and congratulate the National Transitional \nCouncil on its assumption of the seat of Libya at the \nUnited Nations. I salute its efforts to restore stability \nand internal peace. I would also like to express Egypt\u2019s \nreadiness to provide any support that may contribute to \nthe country\u2019s reconstruction efforts and help it to get \nthrough this critical period. \n As for the brotherly State of Yemen, Egypt \nsupports all ongoing efforts to achieve stability and to \nmeet the expectations of its people, in accordance with \nmechanisms to be agreed by the people of Yemen \nthemselves. If the status quo remains unchanged, that \nwill undoubtedly have grave and negative implications \nfor the security and stability of the region. \n Many Egyptians are following with great concern \nthe serious developments in the brotherly State of Syria \nand the resulting loss of lives and the suffering endured \nby our brothers and sisters there. Today, I would like to \nreiterate the position previously expressed by Egypt \nthat the only solution to the crisis in Syria lies in \nending the violence and engaging in a serious dialogue \namong all parties in a climate of political openness. \n Meanwhile, I cannot fail to mention the Arab \nGulf region today and must emphasize that the security \nand stability of the brotherly Arab States of the Gulf \nare of particular strategic importance to Egypt. Given \nthe deep historical, societal, cultural, political and \nsecurity ties that bond us with our brothers and sisters \nin those countries, they are granted very high priority \nand attention in Egypt\u2019s foreign policy. Egypt will \nalways strive to achieve the stability of that vital region \nof the world. \n The issues of disarmament and nuclear \nnon-proliferation remain of great importance to Egypt. \nIn cooperation with our international partners, we will \ncontinue to urge nuclear States to undertake their \nresponsibilities, as stipulated in the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in order \nto safeguard the credibility of that legal instrument and \nits ensuing indivisible principles. Furthermore, Egypt \nwill spare no effort in pursuing the goal of realizing the \nuniversality of the NPT, especially in the Middle East, \nwhere all countries have acceded to the Treaty, with the \nexception of Israel, which is thus delaying the creation \nof a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.  \n That is why Egypt attaches great importance to \nthe implementation of the four action plans adopted at \nthe 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT, \nand especially the plan relating to the Middle East and \nendorsing the holding of a conference on the Middle \nEast next year. In reality, we are concerned that a \nfacilitator has not yet been appointed or a host country \nselected, even though more than 16 months have \nelapsed since the Review Conference ended. \n In that context, I reiterate Egypt\u2019s firm position \nthat the right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy \nmust be linked to full compliance with international \ncommitments under the Treaty, which entails the full \ncooperation of all Member States with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, and avoiding any escalation in \norder to promote non-proliferation efforts in the region. \n Africa has always held a privileged position and \nunique priority status on the Egyptian foreign policy \nagenda. Egypt was a consistent and effective partner of \nthe peoples of the continent in their struggle to gain \nindependence in the 1950s and 1960s. This partnership \ncontinued during the reconstruction period that \n  \n \n11-51360 56 \n \nfollowed independence. Egypt will increasingly work \nto activate and deepen its various cooperation \nmechanisms and frameworks with other African \ncountries and strive to propel them towards a new \ndawn, thereby contributing to the realization of the \nhopes and aspirations of our peoples for more \ndevelopment and increased prosperity. \n Egypt expects the United Nations to maintain its \nefforts to support the various components of the \nAfrican peace and security architecture and to build the \ninstitutional capacity of the continent in conflict \nresolution, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and \nreconstruction. Those efforts should complement its \nsupport for the development aspirations and attempts \nof the African countries to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, in the light of the interlinkages \nbetween peace, security and development challenges in \nAfrica. \n Egypt is following with concern the ever-\ndeteriorating situation in Somalia and calls for \nconcerted regional and international efforts to put an \nend to the sufferings of the brotherly people of that \ncountry and to enable them to achieve peace and \nsuccess in their capacity-building process. Egypt once \nagain invites external parties to refrain from negatively \ninterfering in the internal affairs of Somalia and to \ncontribute instead to efforts to improve the \nhumanitarian situation and achieve stability.  \n In this regard, Egypt has effectively contributed \nto international efforts to address the problem of \ndrought in the Horn of Africa, eradicate hunger and \nprovide food to the affected populations. Egypt also \ncontributes to the fight to exterminate piracy along the \ncoast of Somalia, given the strategic importance of the \nwaters south of the Red and Arabian Seas, especially in \nrelation to Egypt\u2019s national security and to the safety of \nnavigation in the Suez Canal. \n The ability of the United Nations to assume its \nresponsibilities depends on our collective will. What is \nrequired is resolve based on a robust determination to \nstrengthen our joint international efforts to enable the \nOrganization to deal more effectively with the various \ninternational and regional issues and problems that we \nface. That requires collective hard work to reinforce \nthe principles of democracy within multilateralism and \nto promote dialogue and understanding as the sole \nmeans for achieving our goals, thereby advancing the \nideals of humanity and achieving the ambitions of our \npeoples for freedom, justice, peace and security."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to address the \nAssembly once again. Let me, first of all, congratulate \nthe President on his election to his duties of directing \nthe affairs of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I \nwould like to assure him of our full support and \ncooperation throughout his tenure. And I commend his \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for a job well done. We \nappreciate the Secretary-General\u2019s important \ncontribution to the work of the Organization and \ncongratulate him on his recent appointment to a second \nterm. \n On behalf of the Government and people of \nSierra Leone, let me take this opportunity to welcome \nthe Republic of South Sudan, the newest Member of \nthe United Nations family and our continental \norganization, the African Union. We congratulate them \non this achievement and wish them well. \n Sierra Leone is a nation with a relatively small \nterritory and population, but our aspirations to \ndemocracy, prosperity and international peace are as \nbig as any nation\u2019s, and our commitment to those \nideals has been visibly demonstrated in the course of \nour 50 years as an independent nation. We are proud of \nthe distinctive contributions we have made to the \nUnited Nations over the past half-century in areas such \nas decolonization; training and research; the \ninternational civil service; disarmament and \nnon-proliferation, including small arms and light \nweapons; peacemaking and peacekeeping; the \ndevelopment of international law; and, currently, \nreform of the Security Council. \n It is worth mentioning that, soon after our \nadmission to the United Nations, we contributed a \nsmall peacekeeping contingent to the United Nations \nOperation in the Congo. Our commitment to \ninternational peace is evidenced by our transformation \nfrom a nation that received one of the largest ever \nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in the late \n1990s to a country that today contributes troops and \npolice officers to peacekeeping missions in Darfur. We \nhave also developed a proposal to participate in the \nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia. At the same time, \nwe acknowledge with gratitude the enormous impact \nthat the United Nations family has had on the \nmaintenance of peace, governance and economic and \n  \n \n11-51191 4 \n \nsocial development in my country since our admission \nto the Organization, 50 years ago. \n In my capacity as Chair of the African Union \nCommittee of Ten Heads of State and Government on \nthe Reform of the United Nations Security Council, I \nmust emphasize that reform of the Council is urgently \nrequired for the wider United Nations membership to \nfully benefit from the Council\u2019s purposes and primary \nobjective of maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. There is an increasing need for the Security \nCouncil to be more representative, inclusive and \ndemocratic, as well as for an improvement in its \nworking methods and its relations with the General \nAssembly. The status quo is increasingly unacceptable \nand has the potential to undermine the legitimacy, \neffectiveness and efficiency of the Council\u2019s work in \nmaintaining international peace and security. \n It is therefore imperative that we reaffirm our \ncommitment to the standards and principles of this \nnoble Organization by generating the political will for \na reformed Security Council that would pave the way \nfor correcting the historical injustice done to Africa, \nthrough the allocation during this session of two \npermanent and five non-permanent seats to Africa, in \naccordance with the United Nations Charter. \n Since I addressed the Assembly last year, Sierra \nLeone has continued to make steady progress, \nparticularly in the priority sectors outlined in my \nGovernment\u2019s agenda for change, namely, agriculture, \nenergy, infrastructure, health and education. Those five \nsectors were purposely selected from many others \nrequiring transformation because we believe they can \nhave the greatest positive impact on the lives of our \npeople. We have done so against the background of the \nunprecedented challenges facing our world today, such \nas the rise in fuel and food prices, the global financial \ncrisis, and the chain of unending conflicts around the \nworld. \n Inspired by the conviction that no goals, however \ncomprehensive or meaningful, can be achieved without \nthe sustained determination to implement them, I have \ndeclared 2011 the year of implementation for Sierra \nLeone. Accordingly, my Government has demonstrated \nits commitment to that declaration. We are going to \nensure that every single Sierra Leonean benefits from \nthe dividends of our well-earned peace and democracy. \nIn spite of the many challenges that have impeded our \ncapacity to complete our projects, we are determined, \nwith the cooperation and support of our development \npartners, to accelerate our country\u2019s positive \ntransformation. It is my sincere hope that successful \nimplementation of the projects and programmes in the \nJoint Vision of the United Nations Family for Sierra \nLeone, which has been aligned with our agenda for \nchange, will enhance Sierra Leone\u2019s efforts to attain \nthe Millennium Development Goals. \n The economy of Sierra Leone, like many around \nthe world, is currently encountering budgetary \ndifficulties that can be traced to the global economic \nmeltdown. We are, however, optimistic about future \ngrowth levels. We expect export levels to increase, \ngiven our substantial investment in developing our \ninfrastructure and ongoing revamping of our mining, \nagriculture and tourism sectors. We have also put in \nplace strong corrective measures to stabilize the fiscal \nsituation. \n We have continued to build on progress achieved \nin the area of peace consolidation. Our democratic \ninstitutions, such as the National Electoral \nCommission, the Political Parties Registration \nCommission and the Anti-Corruption Commission, \nhave continued to make progress in carrying out their \nrespective mandates. We have also continued to build \non gains achieved in the areas of human rights, gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment. \n The establishment of a Human Rights \nCommission of Sierra Leone and the presentation of \nour national report to the Universal Periodic Review \nWorking Group of the United Nations Human Rights \nCouncil in May this year are clear manifestations of \nour commitment to build a human rights regime that \nrespects international norms and practices. In June this \nyear, the International Coordinating Committee of \nNational Human Rights Institutions awarded an \u201cA\u201d \nstatus accreditation to the Human Rights Commission \nof Siena Leone in recognition of its achievements and \nindependence. \n I have pledged my support and initiated processes \nthat will make women constitute at least 30 per cent of \nelective offices in our country. As a State party to many \ninternational human rights instruments we are \ncommitted to their implementation and respect our \nreporting obligations under the relevant conventions. \nWe have, for instance, just completed our sixth \nperiodic report to the Committee on the Elimination of \nDiscrimination against Women. We have ratified the \n \n \n5 11-51191 \n \nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities and have commissioned a National \nAction Plan for the implementation of Security Council \nresolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008). \n As we prepare for our 2012 presidential, \nparliamentary and local council elections, we are \ncognizant of the fact that it is our primary \nresponsibility to organize and provide the necessary \nlogistical requirements for this democratic process. \nHowever, we need all necessary international \nassistance in support of our commitment to ensure free, \nfair and peaceful elections. In that regard, we have \ncontinued to dialogue with all stakeholders including \nthe National Electoral Commission, the Political \nParties Registration Commission and political parties. \nWe remain committed to peace, security and \ndevelopment, but the need to continue with national \ncapacity-building programmes in priority peacebuilding \nthematic areas beyond the 2012 elections remains \ncritical. \n Recently, peace and stability were not only \nthreatened but painfully disturbed by pockets of armed \nconflict in the subregion of the Economic Community \nof West African States, particularly in the Mano River \nUnion basin. However, we are encouraged by the \nunfolding developments and prospects of relative peace \nin our sister republics. At the same time, we are \nconcerned about the continued threats posed to peace \nand stability by the illicit flow of small arms and light \nweapons across our subregion. International \ncooperation and assistance are necessary in order to \neradicate this menace. Sierra Leone, for its part, \nrecently launched a five-year action plan to expand the \nscope of its activities concerning small arms and light \nweapons. \n Considering the prevailing incidence of violence \nand armed conflict in various regions of the world, the \nchoice of the theme, \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes\u201d, for this year\u2019s general debate is \nrelevant and appropriate. \n Of course, we are quite conscious of the \ninevitability of disputes in the conduct of inter-State as \nwell as intra-State relations. But it is imperative to \nrespect the set of principles enshrined in Article 2 of \nthe Charter of the United Nations in our interactions \nwith each other. They include the sovereign equality of \nall United Nations Members, the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes and the prohibition of the threat or use of \nforce. \n Obviously, mediation remains the best \nmechanism for the prevention and settlement of armed \nconflicts. It should be utilized to the fullest extent \npossible. Sierra Leone firmly believes that the United \nNations should make better use of Chapter VI of the \nCharter, namely, measures for the peaceful settlement \nof disputes. \n We must also allow our discussion of the \nmediation of disputes through peaceful means to move \ntowards the resolution of threats to the international \neconomic and financial systems. The greatest threat \ntoday to the security of most individuals in most \nsocieties stems from the non-resolution of issues \nrelating to excessive speculation in the most important \nfood crops of the world, the rising food and fuel prices \nand the fact that the burden of sacrifice for our \nrecovery is increasingly placed on the shoulders of the \nweak and the poor.  \n In most places in the world we are seeing the \nrallying of the strong and powerful to protect their \nindulgence and the rallying of young people, the weak \nand the dispossessed to secure their very lives, their \ndignity and humanity. The alternatives to the non-resolution \nof those disputes are dire. We must act now to save the \nworld from the anger of the weak and the excessive \nindulgence and repression perpetrated by the strong. \n I would like to emphasize that international \ncooperation in the peaceful settlement of disputes is the \nlife blood of our Organization. In all our deliberations, \nfrom global warming to human trafficking, from the \nthreats of nuclear weapons to the scourge of abject \npoverty, from communicable and non-communicable \ndiseases to ruthless natural disasters, and from the flow \nof illicit drugs to the seemingly unending upheavals in \nthe financial markets, we should always remember that \nwe need each other. The world is too connected for the \nconsequences of failure to be localized.  \n The effects of poverty, disease, hunger and \ndesperation can no longer be boxed in and contained in \na corner of a city, or a country, region or continent. We \nare on each other\u2019s doorsteps, and we must continue to \nbuild the structures for the peaceful resolution of our \nconflicts."

        "file_text": "First of all, \nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession, especially since you represent a brotherly \ncountry that has constantly shown solidarity with \nLebanon and has played a key role in advancing \nagreement and mutual understanding in the Doha \nAgreement and in Lebanon\u2019s reconstruction. I do this \nhoping that our deliberations will contribute to \n \n \n29 11-50692 \n \nshedding light on rightful causes and buttressing the \nlogic of justice. \n This year\u2019s General Assembly is held in a context \ndominated by major Arab developments and the \nrightful Palestinian endeavour for the State of Palestine \nto be recognized and to obtain full membership in the \nUnited Nations. In addition, there are other issues such \nas the persistent tensions on the Korean peninsula, \nnatural disasters that threaten different parts of the \nworld and the persistence of the phenomenon of \nterrorism as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of \nthe 11 September attacks, which we strongly condemn. \n I stand before the General Assembly today as the \nrepresentative of a country that since its inception has \ncarried the message of freedom, concord and \nmoderation. Lebanon strives to consecrate and \nconsolidate that message, in spite of the challenges and \nthreats, both in the East and the West, to models of \ncoexistence and cultural diversity. In accordance with \nits Constitution, Lebanon is \u201ca parliamentary \ndemocratic republic based on respect for civil liberties, \nespecially the freedom of opinion and belief\u201d. \nMoreover, \u201c[t]he people are the source of authority and \nsovereignty; they shall exercise these powers through \nthe constitutional institutions\u201d.  \n Indeed, Lebanon has committed itself to those \nprinciples, to the devolution of power and to the \nparticipation of all religious communities in the \nmanagement of public affairs, in spite of the wars and \naggression it has suffered over decades. Moreover, \nLebanon has always been committed to respecting \nlegitimate international decisions and resolutions, \nincluding those of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, as \nthe ministerial statements of the successive Lebanese \nCabinets have asserted. \n Over the past months, the Arab region has \nwitnessed events and mass popular movements calling \nfor freedom, democracy and the establishment of the \nrule of law, rejecting authoritarianism, favouritism and \ncorruption. Lebanese intellectuals, members of the \nmedia and activists have championed and laboured for \nevery movement of reawakening in the Levant, to \nmake the region a beacon of revitalization. Along with \nthem, Lebanon welcomes any peaceful approach or \nmeans to achieve reform, to consecrate the principles \nof democracy, justice and modernity and to preserve \nhuman dignity and fundamental freedoms.  \n Only through those principles and systems can \nsecurity and peace for all segments of our societies be \nachieved and an environment conducive to sound \nhuman development be ensured. We must respond to \nthe recent upwellings and changes in the Arab world in \nsuch a way that they serve its common good, foster its \nprogress and dignity and prevent it from veering \ntowards extremism, chaos, fragmentation and religious \nor sectarian division. \n At the same time, it must be brought to the \nattention of the international community that the wave \nof popular protest that has arisen in some Arab \ncountries cannot be perceived as stemming simply \nfrom demands to improve living conditions. Therefore, \nallocating funds to support economic and social \ndevelopment in Arab countries undergoing transition is \nnot by itself sufficient to promote democracy, \nmoderation and openness. Indeed, means should be \nexplored to dispel feelings of injustice and oppression \nrankling in the hearts of Arab peoples, who have been \nmarginalized for decades, their development and \ngrowth impeded by Israeli practices and threats, on one \nhand, and by their exclusion from the tide of modernity \nand globalization, on the other.  \n Any such approaches require serious, determined \nefforts \u2014 within the framework of an integrated \nprocess \u2014 to impose a just and comprehensive solution \nto all aspects of the conflict in the Middle East, based \non international resolutions, the Madrid terms of \nreference and the Arab Peace Initiative in all its \nprovisions. That would lay the foundation for a broader \ndialogue and understanding between the East and the \nWest and among civilizations, cultures and religions. \nSuch an understanding is historically overdue, after \ndecades marked by feelings of injustice and hostility, \ndestructive wars and missed opportunities. \n In that connection, it is important to underscore \nthe right and just Palestinian effort to earn full \nrecognition of the State of Palestine and for its full \nmembership in the United Nations, in accordance with \nthe right to self-determination. Lebanon will work for \nthe success of those efforts, with the coordination and \ncooperation of brotherly and friendly countries. \nHowever, recognition of the Palestinian State and its \naccession to the United Nations, though greatly \nimportant, would neither restore full rights to the \nPalestinians nor represent a final solution to the \nPalestinian question. \n  \n \n11-50692 30 \n \n Until a final and just political solution to the \nquestion of Palestine is reached \u2014 one guaranteeing \nthe Palestinian refugees\u2019 right of return \u2014 the United \nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains \nresponsible for the relief of Palestinian refugees, in \ncooperation with the host countries. Along with our \nPalestinian brothers, Lebanon rejects any form of \npermanent settlement of those refugees. For that reason \nthe UNRWA budget must be constantly maintained. \nThe Agency must not be merged with other United \nNations bodies, which would weaken its capacity. \n In another context, Lebanon has recognized the \nLibyan National Transitional Council, and it expects \nLibyan officials, with whom it is communicating for \nthis purpose, to uncover the fate of Imam Musa al-Sadr \nand his two companions, who were made to disappear \nin Libya during an official visit in 1978. \n A few days ago, Lebanon hosted the Second \nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster \nMunitions, which concluded with the 2011 Beirut \nDeclaration. That was a defining moment in the \nimplementation of the Convention. Humanitarian \nconsiderations are at the heart of international concern \nabout cluster munitions. The Meeting highlighted the \nterrible human fallout of those weapons, which were \nused heavily by Israel during its aggression of July \n2006. To this day, those weapons threaten civilians on \ntheir farmlands and innocent children at play in open \nfields in South Lebanon.  \n Israel should be condemned for its use of those \nweapons, and appropriate compensation should be \ndemanded for the extensive property damage and harm \nto people it has caused Lebanon with those weapons. \nIsrael should compensate as well for the overall \ndamage caused by its repeated aggression against \nLebanon, including damage caused by the oil slick that \nresulted from the Israeli bombardment of the Jiyeh \nPower Station in the summer of 2006. \n On the fifth anniversary of the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), Lebanon \nreiterates its commitment to persevere in implementing \nthat resolution. Lebanon calls once again on the \ninternational community to bring pressure to bear on \nIsrael to abide by all its provisions. Those provisions \nrequire Israel to halt its daily violations of Lebanese \nsovereignty and to withdraw immediately from \nLebanese territories that it still occupies in the northern \npart of Al-Ghajar village, the Shaba\u2019a farms and the \nhills of Kfar Shouba. Furthermore, Israel must cease its \npersistent threats against Lebanon and its infrastructure \nand its endeavours to destabilize the country through \nits spying networks and recruitment of agents. \nMeanwhile, we maintain our right to liberate or \nretrieve all of our occupied territories through all \nlegitimate available means. \n On the other hand, we emphasize that we strongly \nuphold our full sovereign and economic rights over our \nterritorial waters and exclusive economic zone and our \nfreedom to exploit our natural resources, be they on \nland or in the deep sea, free from any designs or \nthreats.  \n We have addressed to the Secretary-General an \nextensive correspondence setting out the boundaries of \nour territorial waters and the legitimacy of our \nterritorial rights. Specifically, we laid out the \ngeographic coordinates of the southern and south-\nwestern borders of Lebanon\u2019s exclusive economic \nzone. We raised particular objections to Israeli \nviolations and aggression that violate those rights. \nFurthermore, as we warned against any initiative to \nexploit the resources of the disputed maritime zones, \nwe asked the Secretary-General to take all measures he \ndeems appropriate to avoid any conflict. \n I would like to take this opportunity to commend \nthe crucial role in south Lebanon of the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) carried out in \ncoordination and full cooperation with the Lebanese \nArmy. I would also like to commend the dedication of \nUNIFIL commanders and staff in carrying out the \nmission they have been entrusted with, as well as the \nimmense sacrifices they have made in the service of \npeace. \n While we thank those countries that have \ncontributed military personnel and material for their \ncontinued commitment, in spite of the challenges they \nhave encountered, we also firmly condemn the terrorist \nattacks in recent months on international forces, \nparticularly the French and Italian battalions. We are \nworking earnestly to pursue the perpetrators and bring \nthem to justice and to prevent any recurrence of such \nincidents. \n The United Nations has played an ever-growing \nrole in maintaining international peace and security and \nin intervening to resolve disputes in many troubled \nregions of the world. So far, however, it has been \n \n \n31 11-50692 \n \nunable to show effectiveness in the Middle East, where \ngrave dangers still threaten international peace and \nsecurity as a result of Israel\u2019s ongoing defiance of \nresolutions of international legitimacy; its unacceptable \nrejection of the basic conditions required for peace; \nand its persistence in conducting abusive practices in \nGaza and the occupied territories, such as the illegal \nconstruction of settlements and violations of human \nrights. \n This demands that negotiations on reform of the \nSecurity Council come to fruition, so that the Council \ncan be brought more into line with the new geopolitical \nsituation and be capable of ensuring the \nimplementation of its binding resolutions. \n In conclusion, as we celebrate the centenary of \nInternational Women\u2019s Day this year, we must take \ngreater advantage of the potential and talents of half of \nhumankind, rather than merely seeking to enshrine \ngender equality in principle. Women are making an \nenormous contribution to raising and educating the \nyounger generation, promoting peace, reducing \npoverty, hunger, disease and environmental \ndegradation, and promoting sustainable development \nopportunities. \n The general debate in the Assembly is an \noccasion for all of us to renew the vows we made in \n1945 in order to address the challenges and crises \nfacing us \u2014 by working through institutions of \ninternational legitimacy and agreed collective \nsolutions, in conformity with the basic principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations, its resolutions and the \nprovisions of international law, provided that they are \nbased on the spirit of justice and avoid double \nstandards. History has taught us that this choice is the \none and only reasonable solution."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, allow me to congratulate Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon on his well-deserved reappointment and to \nwish him continued success in his high and responsible \nmission. It also gives me great pleasure to congratulate \nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. \n We welcome the newest member of our family, \nSouth Sudan, which just joined the United Nations as \nour 193rd Member State. \n The world today is undergoing great \ntransformations. The year-long global financial crisis \ngives little sign of being resolved in the near future. \nEven the most developed economies of the world are \nexperiencing the most serious trials of their histories. \nAt the same time, we are fascinated by the success of \ncountries that only yesterday were struggling against \npoverty and stagnation. Humankind is experiencing \nchanges of the most extreme kind. We believe that at \nthis historic moment the United Nations must stay \nahead of the new realities and lead humankind to \npositive new beginnings. \n The people of Kyrgyzstan have been watching the \nhistoric developments in North Africa and the Middle \nEast with feelings of solidarity and sincere empathy. \nOne spring, a year before the Arab Spring, we \noverthrew tyranny in our own land. Our country in the \nheart of Central Asia has now moved from a harsh \npresidential form of Government to a parliamentary \nGovernment. \n Last year, despite serious obstacles, Kyrgyzstan \nsucceeded in holding what were recognized by \ninternational observers to be unprecedented, free and \nfair parliamentary elections and a constitutional \nreferendum. Kyrgyzstan is now ruled by a coalition \nGovernment that, together with an active and \ninfluential parliamentary opposition, is learning to find \nsolutions to problems in the interests of the whole of \nsociety, and not just cater to the ever-increasing \ndemands of kleptocrats, as it did before. Mechanisms \nare now in place to ensure transparency in Government \ndecision-making.  \n  \n \n11-50865 20 \n \n The authorities\u2019 new openness and accountability \nto the people have already begun to bear fruit. The \neconomy is growing. Over the past year alone, \ninvestments in education and health care have \nincreased significantly. A fundamental reform of the \njudiciary has begun. This year, on 30 October the \npeople of Kyrgyzstan will take part in the final phase \nof the transitional period \u2014 the election of a new \npresident of the Republic. In Kyrgyzstan, we want to \nestablish a tradition of peaceful, civilized transfer of \npower, in accordance with the Constitution and in the \ninterests of the people. \n Before the world community, I wish from this \nrostrum to address my own people. Our striving for \ndemocracy and unwavering push to build an open \nsociety are at the centre of the world\u2019s attention. The \nwhole world is watching us. We must be worthy of and \ncherish the freedom that we have won at such a high \nprice. We have no right to divide ourselves along \nethnic, regional or religious lines. Pan-national unity, \nthe rule of law, good governance, civic participation \nand a free press are the achievements that will help us \nto build a prosperous and strong country. \n(spoke in Kyrgyz; English text provided by the \ndelegation) \n My beloved Kyrgyz nation! Cherish your \nindependence, preserve your unity and strengthen your \ndemocracy! \n(spoke in Russian) \n I take this opportunity to invite Member States \nand international organizations to send their observers \nto Kyrgyzstan for the upcoming presidential election. \n On the basis of our 20 years\u2019 experience of \nindependence, we know that the path from victory over \nauthoritarian regimes to building a functioning \ndemocracy is not a straight or easy one. In recent \ndecades, the wealth of the people of Kyrgyzstan, like \nthat of the people of many other countries, has been \nplundered by corrupt and criminal rulers. Billions of \ndollars have been spirited out of the country. Dictators \nshould be held accountable for committing crimes \nagainst their own people and should not be welcomed \nor provided refuge abroad. \n The time has come for our Organization to \ndevelop clear standards and procedures to ensure \njustice and the return of embezzled funds to their \nrightful owners. This is not about settling personal \naccounts or politically motivated harassment; it is \nabove all about delivering justice and ending impunity. \n We are convinced that restoring peace and \nstrengthening the rule of law in Afghanistan will \ndepend less on coercive measures than on the pace and \nmethods we use to resolve social and economic \nproblems. We believe that the decision to withdraw \ninternational troops from Afghanistan must be taken \nonly once the situation there has been tangibly \nstabilized and once the Afghan National Army and \nPolice have sufficient capacity to assume responsibility \nfor the security of their country and its borders. \n We continue to cooperate with the international \ncommunity and the United Nations system in \novercoming the consequences of the last year\u2019s clashes \nin the city of Osh. In this regard, I am sincerely \ngrateful to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the \nsecretariat of the Peacebuilding Fund for supporting \nour efforts to build sustainable peace.  \n Turning to the main theme of the sixty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly, \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d, I wish to refer specifically to the role of \nwomen in times of crisis and to their courage and \nsincerity, which were praised by President Roussef \nfrom this rostrum. When peace is broken and men take \nup arms, it is women who often take responsibility for \nending violence and restoring peaceful life in their \ncommunities. The leadership of mothers, wives and \nsisters can force politicians to resolve their \ndisagreements on the basis of compromise and mutual \nunderstanding. Worldwide, women are a force for \npeace.  \n That is precisely the case in my country, where \nwomen are helping to restoring peace and enhancing \ndemocracy. One-third of the seats in Parliament are \nheld by women. The President of the Supreme Court, \nthe Attorney General, the President of the National \nBank, ministers, governors, countless activists and \nlocal leaders are also women. I firmly believe that, \nunder the strong leadership of Michelle Bachelet, the \nnew, important body that is UN-Women will become a \nchampion of women\u2019s rights around the world. \n Kyrgyzstan is concerned by the shrinking \nattention of the world community to global climate \nchange. In every corner of the world, including our \nregion, this issue has become a part of every country\u2019s \nsecurity. \n \n \n21 11-50865 \n \n We have waited too long to welcome Palestine as \na full Member of the United Nations. As early as 1995, \nKyrgyzstan recognized Palestine along its 1967 \nborders, and we join the Secretary-General in his call \nfor Israel and Palestine to return to the negotiating \ntable. Palestine and Israel should become good \nneighbours on the basis of the two-State solution. The \ncitizens of both countries must finally enjoy their right \nto live in their lands in peace and security. We, the \nnations of the world, hope for the earliest possible \nresolution of this long-running conflict. \n My country has submitted its candidacy for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nperiod 2012-2013. The Kyrgyz Republic, as a member \nof the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries and \nthe group of small countries with economies in \ntransition, and as a young democracy with a multi-\nconfessional population, supports the need for the \nwider representation of all categories of countries on \nthe Security Council. In this regard, I request Member \nStates to support Kyrgyzstan\u2019s candidacy to a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council.  \n The agendas of our meetings and daily headlines \nare dominated by natural disasters, financial crises and \npolitical upheavals. The absence of justice, \ndiscrimination and severe violations of human rights \nremain a part of our lives. At the same time, however, \nwe are witnessing with bewilderment inspiring \nhistorical changes, amazing technological progress, the \neradication of previously incurable diseases and, over \nthe course of just one generation, the lifting of \nhundreds of millions of people out of destitution and \ndisenfranchisement. \n In this time of change, we must do our utmost to \nensure that that the young people of our planet are as \nknowledgeable, as optimistic and as courageous as \npossible in efforts to achieve prosperity, peace and \nsecurity around the world. Young people are not just \nthe future of humankind; they are also its present. Let \nus all open every door and create every opportunity for \nthe growth and development of the younger generation. \nTomorrow is born today!"

        "file_text": "Since we last gathered in \nthis great Assembly one year ago, we have witnessed \ndevelopments of historic dimensions. There has been \ndemocratic protest and democratic reform across the \nArab world, as we discovered afresh that freedom is \nthe right of all, not just of the few. Also, a global \neconomic crisis is rolling on, as we enter a new and \ndangerous period that threatens the jobs and \nlivelihoods of working people everywhere. \n And while rarely making the front pages, the \nother great global challenges that have been with us \nnow for too many years continue their almost \nalarmingly silent advance \u2014 challenges of grinding \npoverty, environmental degradation, the continued \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, the enhancement of \nhuman rights, all of which compete for attention on an \nalready crowded international agenda. \n Our global institutions are struggling to \ncomprehend, let alone effectively respond to, this vast \narray of challenges that now confront us \u2014 challenges \nthat arise as the inevitable consequence of what we \nnow simply call globalization. Put simply, the dilemma \nis this: the challenges we face are increasingly global \nwhile the institutions at our disposal are still primarily \nnational. Or put more crudely, for those engaged in \ndemocratic politics, the answers may lie abroad, but all \nthe votes lie at home. \n Three years ago, when I first spoke at this \npodium, I spoke of the storm clouds gathering across \nthe global economy. It seemed as if we were in free fall \nas we all stared into the abyss, with the very real \npossibility of a second global depression in a century. \nThrough coordinated intervention in 2009, we broke \nthe fall. Yet three years on, the crisis in the global \neconomy continues, still with a capacity to engulf us \nall. Recovery is stalling. Unemployment is rising. \nConfidence is waning. There are growing concerns \nover sovereign debt levels, and there are concerns also \nover the national and international political will to deal \nwith these challenges. \n This week, the International Monetary Fund \nissued a stark warning for the global economy, \nhighlighting that we have entered a new and dangerous \nphase. So what then is to be done?  \n First, reforms to the financial system should be \nimplemented and taxpayers should no longer be asked \nto bail out the irresponsible behaviour of particular \nfinancial institutions. Secondly, all major economies \nneed to find a credible path back to surplus over time, \nconsistent with the Group of Twenty\u2019s Framework for \nStrong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth. Thirdly, we \n  \n \n11-51179 2 \n \nmust prevent a further outbreak of protectionism and \nwe must conclude Doha, as history will condemn us if \nwe repeat the job-destroying protectionism of the \n1930s that transformed a financial crisis into a full-\nblown depression. \n Fourthly, for international trade to grow and \nChinese domestic demand to make a greater \ncontribution to growth in economies around the world, \nwe must also see currency reform, particularly with the \nappreciation of the Chinese yuan. And finally, we must \nwith clarity of leadership and resolution of purpose \ndefine and deliver a range of other new innovative \ndrivers of global growth. These include innovative \npublic-private financing for the new infrastructure \nrevolution needed for power, water, agriculture, \ntransport and communications. The jobs potential for \nthe green energy revolution must be fully harvested by \ncarbon pricing, and women and youth must participate \nfully in the economies of the developed and the \ndeveloping world.  \n These are not just useful social policies. These \nare not just useful environmental policies. They are \nnow necessary economic policies to generate the next \nmissing increment of global economic growth. What is \nrequired, therefore, is global and national political \nleadership capable of looking beyond the next electoral \ncycle \u2014 to look to the long term over the short term, to \nlook to the strategic rather than the tactical, and to look \nto the necessary over the urgent. \n Over the course of the last decade, we have seen \nan acceleration of the shift of economic power to Asia \nmarking Asia\u2019s re-emergence as the centre of global \neconomic gravity after an interruption of more than \n200 years. In the year 2000, China was a mere 3.7 per \ncent of global GDP and India was less than half that. \nBy 2030, they will account for more than 20 per cent \nof global GDP, and that will rise further. Asian \ncountries held 16.6 per cent of global foreign exchange \nreserves in 2001. Now they hold 39 per cent.  \n Therefore, what happens in Asia is now of \nfundamental relevance to the world, not just to the \nregion itself. Asian economic growth has been \noverwhelmingly good for the global economy.  \n But Asia has also seen an exponential increase in \nmilitary expenditure. Over the last 20 years military \nexpenditure in East Asia grew by nearly 150 per cent. \nDuring the same period the United States\u2019 military \nexpenditure grew by 36 per cent. Asia, with its many \nunresolved territorial disputes and military tensions, \nhas become the new global arms bazaar. \n One of the big spenders, despite the poverty \nafflicting its population, is North Korea. North Korea\u2019s \nnuclear weapons programme and its long-range missile \nprogramme represent a direct threat to the security of \nour region, including Australia. \n To deal adequately with those and other security \nchallenges in Asia, we need strong regional \ninstitutional architecture, as a complement to the \nUnited Nations, to help build transparency, cooperation \nand, in time, a sense of common security in our region. \n For that reason, Australia has promoted the \nconcept of an Asia-Pacific community. Collectively, \nregional countries now have an opportunity to realize \nthe idea of such a community through the expanded \nEast Asia Summit (EAS), which for the first time this \nyear will include the Presidents of the United States \nand of the Russian Federation. Over time, a stronger \nEAS can promote the type of rules-based order \nregionally for which the United Nations strives \nglobally. This task is critical to avoid damaging \nstrategic miscalculation in the Asia-Pacific region, \nwhich would also undermine global economic growth.  \n I say again: what happens in Asia now matters \nnot just for Asia, itself, but for the world. \n In Australia\u2019s more immediate region in the South \nPacific, we are bound together by the common bonds \nof democracy and the responsibility we all have to \ndevelop those economies and protect their natural \nenvironment. \n We thank the Secretary-General for his visit to \nthe Pacific Islands Forum \u2014 the first ever by a United \nNations Secretary-General. His commitment to our \nregion is an important signal of the international \ncommunity\u2019s interests in the Pacific\u2019s prosperity, its \nsustainability and its democracy. \n Global events since the last session of the \nGeneral Assembly have highlighted that the human cry \nfor freedom and for democracy is both indivisible and \nuniversal. Australia stands with the rest of the \ninternational community in applauding the courage of \nthose citizens seeking what is naturally theirs in \nTunisia, in Egypt, in Libya, and now in Syria. \n In Egypt, we are now supporting improved dry \nland farming and assistance with urban employment \n \n \n3 11-51179 \n \nprogrammes as Egypt moves to critical parliamentary \nand presidential elections. In Tunisia, we are providing \nagricultural and electoral assistance. In Libya, \nAustralia was among the first to campaign \ninternationally for a no-fly zone to protect civilians at a \ntime when Al-Qadhafi seemed destined for victory. We \nare proud of the fact that since the Libya conflict \nbegan, Australia stands across the world as the third \nlargest humanitarian donor to the long-suffering people \nof Libya. We also stand ready to assist with institution-\nbuilding in the new Libya of the future. \n What challenges us now is the ongoing brutality \nin Syria. The Syrian regime should heed the lessons of \nLibya. We call on Bashar Al-Assad to step down now, \nfor political reform to begin now, and for the \ninternational community to intensify its pressure on \nDamascus to respond to the voices of the Syrian people \ndemanding their legitimate freedom. \n Twelve months ago, we had no expectation of \nchange in Egypt, Tunisia or Libya. But we did hope to \nsee progress in the historic process to bring permanent \npeace to the peoples of Israel and Palestine. Sadly, \nthere has been no progress. Australia remains \ncommitted to a negotiated two-State solution that \nallows a secure and independent Israel to live side by \nside with a secure and independent Palestinian State. \n Over the past 10 months I have travelled three \ntimes to both Jerusalem and Ramallah, where I have \nmet on each occasion with Prime Minister Netanyahu \nand President Abbas. I have urged both parties to \nengage in direct negotiations. I have argued that they \nshould be held on the basis of the 1967 boundaries plus \nappropriate land swaps. I have argued that the \nremaining final status issues \u2014 the right to return, the \nstatus of Jerusalem, the Holy Sites and the provision of \nexternal security \u2014 be resolved through such direct \nnegotiations. \n My fear is that if we do not see these matters \nconcluded in the near term, the rapidly changing \ngeo-politics of the region will make the prospects of a \nlasting settlement remote. We have already seen \ntension between Israel and Egypt. We have already \nseen the fracturing of the relationship between Israel \nand Turkey. We do not know how long the current \nframework of the Arab Peace Plan will remain on the \ntable. We are fearful of a further intifada of the type we \nhave seen before. \n As a friend of Israel, we are fearful that in the \nabsence of a negotiated settlement, Israel\u2019s security \nsituation will deteriorate rapidly in the year ahead. As a \nfriend of the Palestinian people, we believe that the \ntime has come for direct negotiations to establish a \nPalestinian State, one which also guarantees the \nsecurity of Israel. If we fail to achieve this, I fear the \ngravity of the consequences as the ground continues to \nchange across the wider Middle East. I note also that \nthese views have been reflected today by the former \nIsraeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.  \n Australia therefore urges both parties to seize the \nday and to shape the future of a new Middle East. We \nawait the outcome from the weeks that lie ahead in \nNew York, before framing our response to any \nparticular resolution before the United Nations. \n Terrorism is the enemy of all civilized peoples. A \ndecade since 9/11, terrorism still casts a deep shadow \nover the security and safety of our citizens. Many of \nAustralia\u2019s finest have lost their lives in the fight \nagainst terrorism in Afghanistan. Australia will stay the \ncourse in Afghanistan, because we refuse to yield to \nterrorism. \n While terrorism threatens thousands, nuclear \nproliferation threatens millions. Australia remains \nvitally committed to the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free \nworld and is active to that end. That is why we have \nestablished with Japan the Non-proliferation and \nDisarmament Initiative \u2014 the NPDI \u2014 to take forward \nthe agenda of the 2010 Review Conference of the \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons.  \n As we speak in this Assembly, we should remind \nourselves that a fifth of humanity lives in grinding \npoverty. The scale of the challenge has been \ngraphically demonstrated by this year\u2019s devastating \ndrought in the Horn of Africa. I witnessed how bad \nthings are when I visited the affected areas in July. \nAustralia has given almost US$ 100 million. We are \nproud to be the fourth largest international donor to \nthat crisis. We will continue to give. \n Last year, we gathered to see how we were \ntracking on our collective pledge to lift a billion people \nout of poverty by 2015. The report card was very poor. \nMost of the Millennium Development Goals are \nunlikely to be achieved. Australia has doubled its \nofficial development assistance (ODA) budget over the \npast five years, and we are on track to double it again \n  \n \n11-51179 4 \n \nby 2015. Based on available data, that would make \nAustralia\u2019s ODA budget the sixth largest in the world. \n The international community must get behind \nboth regional and global efforts to meet the strategic \nneed for food security. With a forecast global \npopulation of 9.3 billion by 2050, an estimated \nincrease of 70 per cent in global food production will \nbe needed to feed the world.  \n In food security, we should also be blunt. The \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is failing \nfully to meet its mandate to the poor of the world. \nUnder its new management, FAO needs to set clear \npriorities for the future and eliminate the unsustainable \nadministrative overheads it has long tolerated. If FAO \ndoes not do so, Australia will comprehensively review \nits development funding for FAO under our new aid \neffectiveness criteria.  \n Food is fundamental to development. So too is \nthe right to education. All of the world\u2019s children must \nbe given a chance at life that is good for them and good \nfor their economies. For that reason, and learning from \nboth the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria and the GAVI Alliance, Australia believes that \nthe time has come for the international community to \nconsider developing a new public-private institution \nwith an explicit mandate for school education. \n At present, this task is shared between the World \nBank, UNICEF and UNESCO, with negligible private \nsector buy-in. We should consider, therefore, a new \nglobal fund for education that would concentrate \nexclusively on the immediate task of getting nearly \n70 million children into schools by 2015. Australia \nwould consider contributing substantially to such an \ninstitution to bring about real results at a rate as rapid \nas possible. I challenge education donors, current and \npotential, to join such a fund. \n In supporting the world\u2019s most vulnerable \npeoples, we also recognize the world\u2019s estimated \n370 million indigenous peoples, spread across 90 of the \n193 United Nations Member States. They remain \namong the most marginalized and disadvantaged in the \nworld, including in our country, Australia. That is why \nthe Australian Government has reached beyond the \napology to the Stolen Generations to pursue \nconstitutional recognition for our First Peoples. And \nwe are committed to closing the gap between \nindigenous and non-indigenous Australians. \n Our hope of answering the development \nchallenges of the world is inextricably linked to the \nhealth of the planet itself. The planet ultimately can \nbear only so much. Scientists tell us that there are \nplanetary boundaries beyond which we should not \nventure \u2014 in climate change, biodiversity loss, \nstratospheric ozone depletion, chemical pollution, \nocean acidification and the depletion of freshwater \nreserves. It is not just a matter of atmospheric limits, \nbut of the oceans as well. \n Next year at Rio the international community will \nhave the opportunity to act decisively to protect a \nplanet now in stress, just as we need to take effective \nglobal action on climate change. Climate change will \nnot go away, even if some choose the easy path of \nsimply hiding their heads in the sand. If we do that, our \nchildren and theirs will never forgive us \u2014 nor should \nthey. \n As the global community, we face challenges of \nhistoric consequence \u2014 to our global economy, to \nglobal security, to the basic freedoms of all peoples, to \nour global environment, to the security of our citizens, \nto our obligation to the world\u2019s poor and to our \nplanetary boundaries themselves. \n While so many challenges lie before us, the past \nyear has proven that when the international community \ndoes act collectively and decisively, we can deliver \u2014 \nas we have seen in the decisions of the Security \nCouncil on Libya and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. But to be \neffective, this parliament of humankind, these United \nNations, must continue to summon the political will of \nMember States to make our global institutions work. \nOtherwise, we will become a clanging gong, full of \nsound and sentiment, but ultimately symbolizing \nnothing. \n When Secretary-General Ban came to Australia \ntwo weeks ago, he saw a country that values the rules-\nbased system that the United Nations embodies. \nAustralia today is a middle Power with global interests, \nanimated by deep values of freedom and a fair go for \nall. This is the Australia we are proud of in its work in \nthe world. This is the Australia that believes in the \nprinciples of good international citizenship. This is the \nAustralia that rolls up its sleeves, the Australia that by \nnature wants to pitch in, the Australia that wants to \nmake a difference for the betterment of all humankind."

        "file_text": "In May I visited \nTunisia, the cradle of the revolutions that have spread \nacross the Arab world. I spoke to many people there \nwho told me about their deep yearning for freedom, \nabout the decades during which their freedom had been \nsuppressed and about what the revolution meant for \ntheir lives. One of them was Essma Ben Hamida, the \nstrong-willed director of a civil society organization \nactive in micro-finance. She said literally to me, \u201cIf \n  \n \n11-51390 16 \n \ndemocracy would mean that I lose my rights as a \nwoman, I do not want democracy.\u201d In one sentence, \nMs. Ben Hamida defined one of the key challenges we \nface. \n The call from the streets of the Arab world for \nfreedom and democracy has brought about great \nchange. It has inspired people around the world to \nclaim their rights.  \n But huge challenges remain. And the severe \nfinancial and economic crisis is threatening growth and \ntrade around the globe. This crisis is undermining \npeople\u2019s ability to earn a living and enjoy freedom to \nthe fullest extent. It is thus crucial that we manage \nthese developments.  \n The United Nations and individual Governments \nmust support people\u2019s calls for freedom. Freedom is a \nright for everyone, a duty for Governments and the \nmission of the United Nations. Freedom must be \nsupported by three key pillars: first, security; second, \ndemocracy and the rule of law; and third, prosperity. \n Lack of security is a fundamental threat to \npeople\u2019s freedom. Providing security is a responsibility \nof Governments and of the international community as \na whole. \n In March this year, we rose to the challenge. \nSecurity Council resolution 1973 (2011) on Libya was \ntruly historic. It explicitly referred to the international \ncommunity\u2019s responsibility to protect. It highlighted \nthe indispensable role of the United Nations. \n By contrast, the Council\u2019s failure to reach \nconsensus on Syria has been at great human cost. \nEvery day we are shocked by new, horrific stories. This \nvery weekend peaceful demonstrators were carrying a \nsign that read: \u201cHelp Syria. It is bleeding.\u201d We need to \nlisten to the people of Syria. We need to stop President \nAl-Assad\u2019s Government from brutally murdering his \nown citizens in an attempt to crush their legitimate call \nfor freedom. I urge all members of the Security \nCouncil to act decisively and agree on targeted \nsanctions against the regime. \n Freedom and security are also key issues in the \nMiddle East peace process. If we do want peace, we \nneed direct negotiations now, not new resolutions at the \nUnited Nations. The Netherlands endorses the time \nframe outlined by the Quartet and stands ready to assist \nwherever it can. We are a major donor to the \nPalestinian Authority. We fully support the ambition of \nthe Palestinian people to build a viable, democratic and \npeaceful Palestinian State. However, this cannot be \nviewed separately from the Israeli people\u2019s desire to \nlive in a secure, internationally recognized Jewish State \nin peace with their neighbours.  \n It is really essential that the two parties invest in \nmutual confidence, refrain from unilateral steps and \nfind a solution together. They should be prepared to \nmake the difficult and painful concessions necessary \nfor the fulfilment of their peoples\u2019 aspirations. I talked \nwith President Abbas. I talked with Prime Minister \nNetanyahu. I listened carefully to what they had to say, \nand the message is simple and clear: negotiate, \nnegotiate, negotiate. \n Democracy and the rule of law are the best \nguarantees for freedom, but they require hard work. As \nFrancis Fukuyama put it, democracy is more than the \nmajority voting in elections. It is a complex set of \ninstitutions that restrain and regularize the exercise of \npower through law and a system of checks and \nbalances. That is what it is about.  \n I admire the tremendous courage that people, \nyoung and old, have shown to claim their individual \nliberty and democratic rights. We must support their \nefforts to build truly democratic societies governed by \nthe rule of law. The United Nations should play a \nleading role by helping with institution-building and \ndeveloping the rule of law. To that effect, Slovakia and \nthe Netherlands, for their part, are co-chairing the \nCommunity of Democracies\u2019 task force that is \nsupporting Tunisia\u2019s democratic transition. \n The international community should also support \ninternet access that is free and uncensored. This is an \nessential tool for people to exercise their freedom of \nexpression, and we should take great care to make sure \nthey can use it. Countries supporting this cause should \nreally unite around it. \n As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently said, \n\u201cCountries do not become fit for democracy; they \nbecome fit through democracy.\u201d  \n Democracy means freedom and equal rights for \neveryone. It provides opportunities to empower \nwomen. Women represent 50 per cent of the world\u2019s \nhuman capital. It is in every country\u2019s own interest to \nensure that women take an active role in society and \n \n \n17 11-51390 \n \nthe economy as well as in the political process in the \npolitical power structures. I am convinced that in free \nand fair elections, extremists who want to take away \nwomen\u2019s rights will not succeed.  \n Real democracy also means that the rights of \nreligious groups, including Christians, are respected. \nSociety as a whole should be tolerant towards those \nwith other religions and beliefs. There should be no \ndoubt about that. \n Freedom offers the best route to prosperity. The \nongoing global economic crisis is affecting prosperity \neverywhere in our world. \n Enabling free trade is vital to economic recovery. \nMarket access is crucial for private sector \ndevelopment. Breaking down the barriers to trade in \nagricultural products can galvanize entrepreneurship in \nthe countries that really need it the most. The Arab \nregion in particular should benefit from enhanced \nexport opportunities to the European Union.  \n The beauty of well-regulated free trade is that it \nis not a zero-sum game; it benefits everyone and it is \npart and parcel of freedom. This is why the World \nTrade Organization (WTO) Doha Round must succeed. \nThe world should not and cannot revert to \nprotectionism. The WTO has an important part to play \nin preventing this. The European Union is also \nambitiously negotiating free trade agreements with \nvarious partners. Of course, these agreements should fit \nwithin the multilateral system. \n Free trade leads to economic growth, which in \nturn should also benefit the poorest countries in this \nworld. To further support their growth, we should \nenhance their access to education, vocational training \nand microfinance for women and the poor. \n Freedom belongs to us all. Those who have \nfought to gain their freedom will never give it up. \nFreedom must be supported through security, \ndemocracy and the rule of law, and prosperity. We can \nachieve this through the efforts of Member States. \nSince the United Nations is the international forum \nwhere global issues and actors come together, it is here \nat the United Nations that we must join forces. We are \nwitnessing international developments unfolding more \nrapidly than ever before. The United Nations needs to \nadapt to maintain its important role in international \nrelations. \n For that matter, the Security Council should \nbetter reflect changing international relations and \neconomic realities. The Netherlands supports a modest \nenlargement of the Security Council, but with a limit \non the right of veto in order not to undermine the \neffectiveness of the Council\u2019s decision-making process. \n The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General\u2019s \ndrive for budgetary discipline. We have to make careful \nchoices about what to finance and what not to. I also \nurge emerging economies to take their share of \nresponsibility for the sustainability of United Nations \nfunding. \n The United Nations has an essential role in \nfostering the rule of law around the world, as well as in \npreventative diplomacy and mediation. The Netherlands \nwill play its part, including through the role of The \nHague as the international city of peace and justice. \nThe Peace Palace, the international courts and the legal \ninstitutions attest to our long tradition of international \nlaw and active role in its practice. That tradition, may I \nsay, goes back to Grotius\u2019s early seventeenth-century \nMare Liberum, which laid the foundation for \ninternational law. \n I would like to congratulate Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon on his reappointment. I call on him to \nuse the overwhelming support for his second term as a \nmandate to reform the United Nations. A strong and \nactive United Nations is essential in a world in which \nno country can shape the future single-handedly. To \nsucceed, public support for the United Nations is \ncrucial. Clear and tangible results are necessary to \nsustain the commitment of Governments to the United \nNations. An effective and efficient United Nations is in \nthe national interests of all its Member States, and is, \nindeed, essential for freedom throughout the world. \n Through our efforts at the United Nations, we can \nsupport the calls for freedom around the world. Then, \non my next visit to Tunisia, Essma Ben Hamida, a \nstrong-willed woman, can hopefully tell me that \nfreedom has brought her both democracy and her rights \nand empowerment as a woman."

        "file_text": "My \ncountry, Togo, welcomes the election of the President \nof the Assembly to direct the work of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. On behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Togo and on my own \nbehalf, I would like to convey our warm \ncongratulations to him. We wish him every success in \naccomplishing his noble and exhilarating mission. \n Today more than ever, the ever increasing number \nof challenges facing the planet call for greater \nsolidarity to provide an effective global solution \nworthy of our peoples\u2019 aspirations. When world leaders \nbringing forth their nations\u2019 ambitions meet in this \nforum to reflect upon the main issues of the hour, it is \nto give their people hope for a brighter tomorrow. \n \n \n23 11-51372 \n \n In order to address those various challenges, Togo \nhas for several years endeavoured to relaunch its \neconomy to achieve sustainable development for the \nwell-being of its people. We have made strengthening \nnational unity and good governance, reviving economic \ngrowth and combating social injustice our rallying cry. \n In terms of political governance, Togo remains \nfaithful to its new vision of sharing its victory with all \nstakeholders of goodwill, including political parties \nthat have lost in elections. Above all, this is about \nemphasizing the peoples\u2019 victory and not that of any \npolitical party. In our opinion, that concept of power \nshould inspire all leaders who seek greater stability \nfollowing elections. \n Based on its desire to strengthen the gains made \nin the area of democratization, the Government of Togo \nsupports the implementation of the recommendations \nmade by the European Union election observation \nmission, including institutional and constitutional \nreforms, especially against the backdrop of the local \nand legislative elections to be held in 2012. In that \nrespect, faithful to the policy of openness and \ncooperation initiated by our head of State, the \nGovernment has renewed its dialogue with all political \nand civic stakeholders under its permanent framework \nfor dialogue and cooperation in order to pursue \ndiscussions on all subjects concerning the management \nof governmental affairs. \n The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation \nCommission, launched two years ago with the task of \npromoting national reconciliation, is currently at the \ncritical stage of holding both public and closed \nhearings, according to witness preference. That is an \nopportunity for all Togolese men and women to talk to \neach other about the most painful moments of their \nhistory and to speak truthfully in order to ensure justice \nand reconciliation, thereby making it possible to turn \nthe page once and for all. \n In terms of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms, the Government of Togo has made \ncommitments to increasing State capacities to protect \nindividuals and property and guarantee fundamental \nfreedoms in order to prevent Togo\u2019s young democracy \nfrom losing ground with regard to the progress made in \nshaping its identity, as well as to avert any exploitation \nof differences. In that regard, Togo has just provided \nthe governing body of the Human Rights Council in \nGeneva with its national report in connection with the \nuniversal periodic review that will take place in a few \nweeks.  \n Togo would like to reaffirm its determination to \nhonour its international commitments. We will \ncontinue to combat all types of human rights violations \nand to take action against their perpetrators. My \ncountry will therefore tirelessly continue the work \nalready begun in order to strengthen the gains of \ndemocracy and peace, while making greater efforts to \nimplement the Millennium Development Goals. \n In terms of economic governance, Togo is \npursuing reforms for better management of its public \nfinances, in order to optimize domestic revenues. We \nare working for a more robust financial sector, \nprivatizing public banks, operationalizing the Court of \nAuditors and instituting a new public tendering code \nthat is fully aligned with international standards. All \nthat is in addition to the steps we have taken towards \nmembership in the Extractive Industries Transparency \nInitiative. Among other things, those various measures \nhave allowed us to successfully conclude our \nparticipation in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \nDebt Initiative and to benefit from about $1.8 billion in \ndebt cancellation. The broad ongoing programme to \nimprove and rehabilitate road infrastructure throughout \nour national territory is an illustration of the effective \nimplementation of this reform. On behalf of the \nGovernment and the people of Togo, I would like to \nthank all our partners that have assisted in our process \nto improve governance.  \n This meeting is taking place at a time when \nAfrica is again threatened by famine such as we have \nnot witnessed in 20 years. All countries, as well as the \nUnited Nations, must take urgent measures to confront \nthat exceptional situation if we wish to avoid a large-\nscale humanitarian tragedy. \n With respect to resolving conflict and promoting \npeace and security throughout the world, which is the \ntheme of this session, it is encouraging to note that \nsignificant progress has been made. That is particularly \nin the case in Africa, where peace and security have \nbeen restored in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, thereby enabling the \nrelaunching of socio-economic activities in that \ncountry. \n The peaceful resolution of the lengthy conflict in \nSouth Sudan, which has become the Organization\u2019s \n193rd Member State, gives us reason to hope that any \nconflict can be resolved acceptably and sustainably so \n  \n \n11-51372 24 \n \nlong as the parties concerned work in good faith to \nachieve that goal. \n Also as we meet here, parts of the world continue \nto face waves of demonstrations and uprisings, \nespecially in Africa. Those legitimate movements \ncontribute to the blossoming of democracy for the \npeople concerned. In addition to delivering on their \nlegitimate expectations, they also help to avoid any \nrisk of wavering in the medium term that might \njeopardize peace and national unity. That seems to be \ntrue for all conflicts, because we believe that no \nsustainable solution is possible outside of negotiation.  \n With regard to the Middle East, my country \ntherefore firmly believes that the parties to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict and the international community \nmust continue to seek a political solution to that old \nconflict. The Middle East must know peace. Israel and \nPalestine must coexist in two States with well-defined \nborders, in peace and security. We are fundamentally \nconvinced that the aspirations of the Palestinian people \nfor a national State and those of Israel for sustainable \npeace and security are not contradictory, but \ncomplementary, objectives.  \n Despite the many efforts and determination of the \nUnited Nations to eradicate terrorism in all its forms, \nthat scourge is gaining even more ground and is \ncompromising the chances for building a world of \npeace and security. This year, as we commemorate the \ntenth anniversary of the tragic attacks on 11 September \n2001, the international community and all States must \ncontinue to work synergistically so that humankind \nwill not again experience such indiscriminate and \nwanton attacks as those of 9/11 or those that recently \nvictimized the peaceful people of Norway and the \nheadquarters of the United Nations in Abuja. \n Those crises and conflicts, as well as new threats \nto international peace and security, such as maritime \npiracy, cyber crime and drug trafficking, which \nundermine efforts to build peace throughout the world, \nrequire the international community to rethink the role \nof the United Nations in the context of security and \nsocio-economic development. At a time when the West \nAfrican subregion is witnessing an increase in violence \ndue to drug trafficking and terrorism in the area, we \ncannot allow our shorelines to be taken hostage by \npirates, as was recently the case in the waters off Benin \nand Togo. I call for stricter cooperation among all \ncountries to effectively combat this new phenomenon.  \n As I just said we need to rethink the role of the \nUnited Nations. While it is widely acknowledged that \nnothing can replace the Organization, it is just as true \nthat, 65 years after it was established, the United \nNations needs to be reformed. My country therefore \ncalls on Member States to pursue and conclude the \nprocess of Security Council reform, which began more \nthan 15 years ago. Like the majority of Member States, \nTogo hopes that this General Assembly session will \nprovide us an opportunity to take decisive steps with \nregard to Council reform. In so doing, we have the \nopportunity to correct flagrant and unacceptable \ninjustices and to make the Security Council truly \nrepresentative of all the regions of the world, thereby \nmaking it better placed to resolve the crises and \nconflicts that we face. \n With regard to the process of replacing \nnon-permanent members of the Council, the Assembly \nwill elect five new members in October to replace \nthose whose terms will end on 31 December. Togo is \namong the candidates from the Group of African States \nthat are seeking the votes of Member States in those \nelections.  \n Contrary to the practice observed today in Africa \nwith respect to elections to the Security Council, three \ncandidates are in the running this year for the two seats \nthat go to Africa. Togo, whose candidacy enjoys the \nendorsement of the Economic Community of Western \nAfrican States and the African Union, of course \nattaches great importance to the sovereign right of each \nState to apply for a seat on any United Nations body. \nHowever, I would like to ask all delegations to bear in \nmind the need to see emerge, after the elections, a \nSecurity Council that is balanced and representative of \nall the major regions in Africa, especially West Africa. \n My country has participated in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations for many years. We are \ncurrently involved in the missions in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and \nthe Sudan, and will soon participate in the one in South \nSudan. We wish to sit on the Council in order to make \na contribution, however modest, to the work of the \norgan responsible for the maintenance of international \npeace and security.  \n If elected, Togo will focus on the importance of \npreventive diplomacy in the peaceful settlement of \nconflicts and the link between peace and security, on \nthe one hand, and social justice and development, on \nthe other. We would also not neglect combating the \n \n \n25 11-51372 \n \nscourges to which I referred earlier, as well as new \nthreats to international peace and security.  \n Togo\u2019s noble ambition can only come to pass if \nwe have the support of delegations for our candidacy. \nIt is my hope that all Member States will wish to \nprovide their invaluable support for our candidacy. I \nwish very much to thank them in advance for their \nsupport."

        "file_text": "Allow me to extend our \ncongratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on \nhis assumption of the Presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am confident that \nwith his wide knowledge, experience and diplomatic \nskills, we will be able to achieve fruitful results in our \ndeliberations in addressing important and critical issues \non the international agenda. \n I would also like to convey our appreciation to \nMr. Joseph Deiss for his able leadership and \ncontributions to the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly. May I also take this opportunity to once \nagain extend our congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his reappointment, and \nwe wish to express our sincere appreciation to him for \nhis dedication and untiring efforts for the cause of the \nUnited Nations. \n Since I am addressing the General Assembly for \nthe first time after the emergence of the constitutional \nGovernment and as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar, I would like to \napprise the Assembly of recent developments and \nsignificant changes taking place in my country. The \nRepublic of the Union of Myanmar has emerged as a \nnew democratic nation in accordance with the \nConstitution approved by the overwhelming majority \nof the people.  \n Multiparty democratic general elections were \nheld in Myanmar in November 2010 in line with the \nseven-step roadmap. Thirty-seven political parties, \nincluding 19 parties from different national ethnic \ngroups, contested in the elections. Today, elected \nrepresentatives are exercising their democratic rights in \nthe legislative bodies. \n The President, in his inaugural speech to the first \nregular session of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw on 30 March \n2011, stated that all elected Hluttaw members, \nincluding the President, are duty-bound to honour and \nsafeguard the Constitution of the Republic of the \nUnion of Myanmar. The new Government pledged that \nall citizens shall enjoy equal rights under the law and is \ndetermined to strengthen the judiciary. The \nGovernment also assured the nation that it will amend \nand revoke existing laws and adopt new laws as may \nbe deemed necessary to implement the provisions of \nthe fundamental rights of the citizens. \n With a view to maintaining and promoting \nfriendly relations with all countries in the world, \nMyanmar is reaching out to the international \ncommunity. In the past five months, Myanmar has \nreceived the visits of State leaders and high-level \ndelegations from our neighbouring countries, as well as \nfrom other regions and international organizations. In \nreturn, President Thein Sein paid official visits to the \nRepublic of Indonesia and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. The President also attended the eighteenth \nsummit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) in Jakarta. \n The new Government has launched a series of \neconomic, social and policy reforms designed to \nimprove the socio-economic life of the people of \nMyanmar. One of those measures is the stepping up of \n  \n \n11-51670 24 \n \nits efforts to reduce poverty. In Myanmar, about 70 per \ncent of the population resides in rural areas and \nengages in agricultural and livestock farming. In order \nto boost production and enhance the economic \ndevelopment of rural areas, the Government has \nadopted forward-looking economic policies. Those \npolicies will lead to sustained, inclusive and equitable \neconomic growth, which will in turn increase \nemployment opportunities, promote agriculture \ndevelopment and reduce poverty.  \n Towards that end, the new Government has \nadopted the National Rural Development and Poverty \nReduction Plan to alleviate poverty and to improve the \nlivelihood of people residing in rural areas. A central \ncommittee and various work committees have been \nformed to supplement the eight tasks laid down under \nthe National Plan. Furthermore, the new Government \nhas increased pension allowances for retired service \npersonnel commensurate with the changing economic \nand social conditions of the country. With a view to \nencouraging foreign trade, the Government reduced the \nexport tax from 8 per cent to 2 per cent and granted \nexport tax exemptions for all agricultural and timber \nproducts. \n It is regrettable that the Government\u2019s efforts to \nimprove the livelihood of the people of Myanmar are \nbeing hampered by economic sanctions. I would \ntherefore like to call upon countries that have imposed \nunilateral sanctions on my country to lift those \nrestrictions. It will also contribute to our efforts to \nachieve our Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \ntargets. \n Myanmar attaches great importance to the \npromotion and protection of human rights. The \nfundamental rights of the country\u2019s citizens are \nguaranteed by relevant provisions of the State \nConstitution. With a view to promoting and \nsafeguarding the fundamental rights of its citizens as \nset forth in the Constitution, the Myanmar National \nHuman Rights Commission was formed on \n5 September 2011. \n Myanmar\u2019s cooperation with the United Nations \nhas been clearly demonstrated by the Government\u2019s \nacceptance of the fourth visit of Mr. Tom\u00e1s Ojea \nQuintana, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of \nhuman rights in Myanmar in August 2011. \nMr. Quintana recognized and welcomed the steps taken \nby the Government to improve the human rights \nsituation in the country. He also welcomed the \nGovernment\u2019s stated commitments to reform and the \npriorities set forth by the President. \n Myanmar has been cooperating closely with the \nUnited Nations Human Rights Council. Myanmar\u2019s \nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR) report was submitted \nand reviewed by the UPR Working Group last January \nand adopted at the seventeenth session of the Human \nRights Council last June. Myanmar has agreed to \naccept 52.4 per cent of the total recommendations. We \nstrongly believe that the UPR process is the most \ndependable and non-controversial monitoring \nmechanism for addressing and rectifying the human \nrights situations of all countries. \n As for national reconciliation, the Government \noffered an olive branch to all the ethnic armed groups \nin the country through Announcement No. 1/2011 on \n18 August, and some of those groups have accepted the \nGovernment\u2019s offer. The Government also granted an \namnesty on 16 May 2011, with 20,000 inmates having \nbeen released by the end of July. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to inform the General Assembly that \nthe President, in exercising the mandate vested in him \nby the Constitution, will grant a further amnesty at an \nappropriate time in the near future. \n The President invited people to work together for \nthe interest of the nation despite differences. \nAccordingly, he received Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on \n19 August 2011, and, putting aside differing views, \nthey had candid and cordial discussions with a view to \nfinding common ground and exploring a potential \ncooperation in the interest of the nation and its people. \n The foregoing are some of the significant items \nof progress we have achieved in our democratization \nprocess. \n As an agro-based country, Myanmar is following \nwith keen interest the issues involving the effects of \nclimate change. Since agriculture is highly dependent \non the climate, the implications of the climatic \nsituation on agriculture cannot be ignored. Lately, \nfloods and droughts have devastated crops and \nagricultural production in our region. It is evident that \ndeveloping countries are the most vulnerable and will \ntherefore be the first to suffer from global warming and \nclimate change. \n We therefore look forward to reaching tangible \noutcomes at the upcoming seventeenth Conference of \n \n \n25 11-51670 \n \nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the seventh \nSession of the Conference of the Parties serving as the \nmeeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Durban, \nSouth Africa. Although the road to Durban will be a \ndifficult one, my delegation shares the view that our \ndiscussions on the issue should be placed within the \ncontext of promoting sustainable development. In that \nregard, we would also like to stress that all three \npillars, namely, economic development, social \ndevelopment and environmental protection, need to be \npromoted in an integrated, coordinated and balanced \nmanner. \n Myanmar strongly condemns terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations. In today\u2019s world, terrorism \nand transnational organized crime are increasingly \nthreatening human society. Myanmar is also among \nthose countries that have been victim of the scourge of \nterrorism. In that regard, we would like to express our \ndeepest condolences to the bereaved families of \nvictims of terrorism around the world. We welcome the \nSecretary-General\u2019s commitment to conducting a \nglobal threat review in order to re-assess security \nthreats in the wake of the deadly attack in Abuja, \nNigeria. Myanmar stands ready to cooperate at the \nregional and international levels to prevent and combat \nterrorism and transnational organized crimes. Without \na stable and peaceful environment, sustainable \ndevelopment would not be possible for the people of a \ncountry or in a region and beyond. \n The Millennium Declaration set 2015 as the \ntarget date for achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals, which were formulated to address the welfare \nand needs of people around the world. Despite some \nprogress, development efforts have been hindered by \nvarious factors, such as slow economic growth, \ndiminishing resources, increasing food prices and \nongoing concern over food security, increasingly \nfrequent natural disasters and the challenges posed by \nclimate change. Each country has the primary \nresponsibility to generate its ways and means for \nachieving social and economic development. However, \nnational efforts to that end need to be supported by the \ninternational community. \n For our part, Myanmar is determined to promote \nbetter living standards and the equitable development \nof its people. To generate income, microfinance \nschemes have been introduced at the grassroots level. \nAccording to the United Nations Development \nProgramme, the poverty rate in Myanmar has \ndecreased from 32 per cent to 26 per cent in recent \nyears. However, we have to redouble our efforts to \nachieve MDG 1 by the year 2015. \n The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons is the cornerstone of international efforts to \nprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, promote \nnuclear disarmament and cooperation, and ensure \naccess to nuclear energy. As a signatory to the Treaty, \nMyanmar remains committed to the three pillars of the \ntreaty. As a strong advocate of nuclear disarmament, \nMyanmar has been tabling a draft resolution on nuclear \ndisarmament every year since 1995, one which enjoys \nwide support from Member States. Myanmar firmly \nopposes the proliferation and production of nuclear \nweapons and strongly supports any efforts leading to \nthe realization of a world free of the threat of nuclear \nweapons and their by-products. \n Recently, the world around us has changed. We \nhave seen changes in Governments and political \nlandscapes. Myanmar has transformed and is moving \ntowards becoming a democratic nation in a smooth and \npeaceful manner. We have now embarked on a series of \nreforms in various sectors to bring about \ndemocratization and economic development and \nimprove the lives of our people. \n The steps taken by the Government of Myanmar \nare concrete, visible and irreversible. We will ensure \nthat the reform process is incremental, systematic and \ndynamic. Myanmar is strongly determined to continue \nimplementing the democratization process despite all \nof the current challenges. At this critical juncture, the \nencouragement, understanding and support of the \ninternational community are crucial to Myanmar\u2019s \ntransition to democracy."

        "file_text": "At the very outset, allow \nme to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his well-deserved \nelection to the office of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of my \ndelegation\u2019s full support during his tenure. Let me also \npay fitting tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, \nfor the commendable manner in which he led the work \nof the General Assembly during the sixty-fifth session.  \n Mr. Ban Ki-moon also deserves our heart \ncongratulations on his reappointment as Secretary-\nGeneral. His unanimous re-election was a true \nreflection of the confidence that all Member States \nhave in him. \n I also wish to express my profound joy at \nwitnessing the Republic of South Sudan join the ranks \nof the Members of the United Nations. We welcome \nthis new Member and extend our hand in friendship. \n This sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly \nonce again provides us with an opportunity to reflect \non the overall situation in the world. The world \ncontinues to experience numerous challenges. The \ntarget date for the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals is fast approaching, yet the world \ncontinues to be overwhelmed by unending hurdles on \nthe path towards their achievement.  \n Despite globalization, the least developed \ncountries are yet to be fully integrated into global \nmarkets. Rapid environmental degradation, \ncompounded by the effects of climate change, \ncontinues to adversely affect ecosystems, agriculture, \nwater resources and energy supplies. HIV and AIDS \nhave not relented in decimating whole nations. The \npromotion of the principles of democracy and good \ngovernance, the protection of fundamental human \nrights, and the abuse of power in international relations \ncontinue to present challenges. \n As if this were not enough, terrorism continues to \ntorment us. Along with the other challenges, this is a \nfight that we collectively must win. Terrorism is a \n  \n \n11-51360 2 \n \ntransnational problem that cannot be left to one State \nalone to confront. All Member States must cooperate in \naddressing and eliminating this menace. The biggest \nchallenge that we face in the post-Cold War era is to \nensure that terrorists do not lay their hands on weapons \nof mass destruction.  \n In this regard, we reiterate our call for the total \nelimination of all nuclear weapons. We urge the \nnuclear weapon States to remain faithful to their \ncommitments under the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We \nfurther call on those Member States that have not \njoined the NPT to do so without further delay. \nHowever, it would be illogical to ask non-nuclear \nStates to shun the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \nwhile States that possess them continue to perfect new \ngenerations of such weapons and to threaten their use \nat the slightest opportunity. \n Some States Members of this global Organization \ncontinue to experience either internal or external \nconflicts of significant proportions. The international \ncommunity has not been consistent in its approach to \nthe management of these conflicts. In some countries, \nthe international community, acting through the \nSecurity Council, has been swift and decisive in \nintervening militarily. In other countries, the same \ninternational community has preferred mediation, and \nin yet still others it has turned a blind eye, at best \nleaving the mantle to some of its members to \nunilaterally threaten the imposition of sanctions. \n It is against this background that we welcome the \ntheme of our general debate, \u201cThe role of mediation in \nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means\u201d. Indeed, \nthe relevance and appropriateness of this theme at the \npresent juncture in international relations is beyond \ndoubt. In addressing this theme, we start from the \npremise that the peaceful settlement of disputes \nthrough mediation lies at the heart of the work of the \nUnited Nations. However, the United Nations has not \nsufficiently used mediation as a tool for conflict \nresolution.  \n The United Nations is charged with the \nmaintenance of international peace and order through \nthe Security Council. Consequently, the Council is \nexpected to take a leading role in the settlement of \ndisputes through mediation. In so doing, the Council \nmust adopt the multilateral approach. Such an approach \nis the only way to guarantee transparency, impartiality \nand ownership of the process by the general \nmembership of the United Nations. Mediation must \nhave as its priority the peaceful settlement of disputes, \nthe reconciliation of the parties and the future \nsustainability of peace and stability. Peace that is \nimposed without consulting all parties to conflicts \ncannot be sustainable. Bias and abuse of military \npower to influence the outcome of mediation in \nconflicts will quickly erode the credibility of the \nUnited Nations as an honest mediator and will \nreinforce perceptions of ulterior motives. \n The Kingdom of Lesotho is a strong believer in \nthe principle of subsidiarity. It is common knowledge \nthat the primary role in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security reposes in the Security \nCouncil. However, cooperation and coordination \nbetween the Council and regional organizations, in \nterms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, is \nkey to resolving conflicts speedily. The United Nations \nmust empower and support the efforts of regional \nstructures and organizations, which in all cases have a \ncomparative advantage in mediating. \n However, the Security Council can better \ndischarge this function only if it is more representative \nof the membership of the United Nations. A more \nrepresentative Security Council will take into account \nall our aspirations, and its decisions will command \nlegitimacy. Consequently, we continue to call for the \nearly and comprehensive reform of the Security \nCouncil in order to make it more representative of the \nMember States. It is simply baffling, if not appalling, \nto see how this all-important issue of Security Council \nreform is being deliberately stymied. \n The settlement of conflicts through mediation has \nbeen put to the test, and its successes are well recorded \nin the annals of history. The peaceful settlement \nthrough mediation of the conflict in the Republic of \nKenya in 2007 is a typical example. It should be \nrecalled that, in Kenya, a group of eminent persons \nfrom Africa worked together with the United Nations \nto broker a peaceful solution to the political stalemate \nthat resulted from the disputed parliamentary and \npresidential elections of 2007. That solution resulted in \nthe formation of an all-inclusive and stable \nGovernment.  \n Secondly, a specific subregional mediation by the \nSouthern Africa Development Community yielded \nfruitful results in Zimbabwe, as did that of the African \n \n \n3 11-51360 \n \nUnion (AU) in Burundi. Furthermore, we witnessed a \nsuccessfully mediated solution bring an end to Africa\u2019s \nlongest civil war in the Sudan.  \n The world rejoiced together with the people of \nSouth Sudan in July 2011 upon their attainment of \nindependence as a sovereign nation. The remarkable \nmediation efforts of the African Union, with the \nsupport of the entire international community, helped \nin consolidating peace in South Sudan. Indeed, the \nmediation efforts are continuing in that sister country \nto ensure the maintenance of peace in the post-conflict \nperiod. \n It is our humble but considered opinion that, \nwhere mediation has been given a chance, lives have \nbeen saved. The cost in resources, be they financial or \nhuman, has been minimal, and the destruction of \ninfrastructure avoided. Above all, reconciliation \nbetween the warring factions has been realized. \n Strangely, and despite having mediation at its \ndisposal, the Security Council has at times preferred \nmilitary intervention. I may also add that, at times, \nsome members of the international community have \nunilaterally engaged in military interventions. \nWhenever military intervention has been preferred, it \nhas not enjoyed the support of the general membership \nof the United Nations. Needless to say, the impact of \nmilitary intervention in conflicts is catastrophic for \ninnocent civilians, and it destroys infrastructure and \nthe economies of countries.  \n In this regard, Libya may be used as a case study. \nThe African Union developed a comprehensive road \nmap that would have led to a peaceful settlement of the \nLibyan crisis by the Libyan people themselves. Sadly, \nwe witnessed the deliberate marginalization of the AU \nin the resolution of that crisis. Military intervention \nwas hastily adopted as an option, and the results of this \nkind of intervention are a matter of record for all to \nsee, and indeed will be with us for a long time to come. \n Nevertheless, the opportunity for all stakeholders \nto work together on consolidating peace in Libya has \nnot eluded us. The African Union road map for peace \nremains as relevant today as it was at the beginning of \nthe conflict. The United Nations and the African Union \nmust work together to bring about the consolidation of \npeace, national reconciliation and the establishment of \nan all-inclusive Government in Libya. The United \nNations, and not just a few countries with vested \ninterests, should take the lead in the reconstruction of \nthat country. This transparent and unbiased approach \nalone can ensure that there is no relapse into conflict in \nLibya. \n We must employ all assets at our disposal so as to \nfully exploit mediation as a tool for conflict prevention \nand resolution. The good offices of the Secretary-\nGeneral in conflict prevention and resolution are an \ninstrument that may be very effective in mediating \nconflicts. Those offices must be strengthened and given \nthe human and other resources necessary to undertake \nmediation early enough to prevent conflicts and to deal \neffectively with those that are ongoing. In that regard, \nwe encourage the mediation efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral towards the realization of a free and \nindependent Western Sahara. \n By the same token, we are convinced that the \nsolution to the settlement of the question of Palestine \nwill be attained through genuine mediation. The \nstalemate in the negotiations is a source of grave \nconcern to my country. We urge all the parties involved \nto resuscitate the negotiations between the State of \nPalestine and Israel without any further delay.  \n Similarly, we must explore the possibility of a \nmediated solution to the problem between the Republic \nof Cuba and the United States of America. The \ninternational community has been unanimous in its call \nfor the lifting of the economic and commercial \nembargo imposed upon Cuba, yet the problem persists. \nIndeed, Cuba, like all Member States, is entitled to \nfreedom of international trade and navigation. \n I conclude by pointing out that the crises we face \ntoday provide us with an opportunity for introspection \nand to chart the way forward. The obstacles that lie \nahead of us are not insurmountable. We must build a \nmore robust multilateral organization that is responsive \nto the modern-day needs of our peoples. A United \nNations that is able to work with its partners, including \nregional and subregional organizations, and all of its \nMember States will surely achieve much success in all \nof its endeavours. With renewed political will and \ndetermination, let us commit ourselves to the principles \nof mediation, as enshrined in the United Nations \nCharter, and to the peaceful settlement of all disputes \nand conflicts."

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to \ndeliver this address on behalf of the people and the \n \n \n19 11-51670 \n \nGovernment of Belize. It is a particular privilege to do \nso with Mr. Al-Nasser at the helm of the Assembly. I \nsay so because Belize has the distinct pleasure of \nhaving him as the Ambassador of Qatar to Belize, a \nrole in which he has distinguished himself and his \nnation, much as he is doing in his role as President of \nthe Assembly. \n Today\u2019s world is characterized by disputes \nbetween neighbouring States which have resulted and \ncontinue to result in untold damage, loss of life and \nfinancial ruin to the feuding States. Thus Mr. Al-Nasser\u2019s \nselection of the theme \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes\u201d for this year\u2019s general debate is \na timely and appropriate one. We in Belize fully \nsubscribe to the view that mediation is a much more \nsensible means of putting an end to disputes than the \nuse of force or threats of force, especially in the case of \nneighbouring States whose people have to live side by \nside and who are often dependent upon one another for \nsurvival and security. \n But today\u2019s world is also characterized by \nwidespread anxiety, insecurity, unrest, violence and \ninstability. This is manifested in our financial markets \nas well as in the streets of cities in the developed and \nthe developing world. Threats, both natural and man-\nmade, appear to be proliferating. Debt crises are now \nso globalized that they are dwarfing national fiscal and \npolicy space. Drugs, arms and human trafficking \ndominate the global stage, while Mother Nature is \nundergoing extreme changes, leaving death, destruction \nand disaster in her wake. \n Thus far, unfortunately, international responses to \nthese catastrophic occurrences have been both \nuninspiring and inadequate. \n Notwithstanding the armoury of human rights \nthat are enshrined in our own Human Rights Charter, \nfar too many people are still destitute, are still dying \nfrom hunger, are still casualties of preventable or \ncurable diseases, are still illiterate, are still jobless and \nare still marginalized and excluded from their very own \nsocieties. \n Three years after the 2008 economic and \nfinancial crisis, the global economy is once again \nbracing for another setback, as the recovery in major \nindustrialized economies stutters and risks a very real \ndanger of reversal. Terrorism remains no less of a \nglobal threat. Mortality from non-communicable \ndiseases now rivals mortality from communicable \ndiseases. And greenhouse gas emissions continue to \nfuel global warming at a perilous rate. \n Faced with the plethora of ills that now beset our \nworld, we in Belize entertain no doubt that if any \ninstitution holds the key to solving the world problems \nit is this Organization, the United Nations, and its \nvarious agencies and institutions. Belize is therefore \nlooking to the United Nations to lead the charge and to \npartner with us in combating three of the most serious \nthreats that presently confront us, namely, the threat \nposed by climate change, the threat posed by crime and \nviolence and the threat posed by chronic \nnon-communicable diseases. \n For small island and coastal States like Belize, \nglobal warming poses an existential threat. We have \nalready been overwhelmed by the nature, scale and \nfrequency of the damage that extreme weather \nconditions, triggered by global warming, have wrought \non our infrastructure and marine and terrestrial \norganisms. While we appreciate that each of us is \nprimarily responsible for our own welfare and we are \ntaking such measures as are within our competence to \ncope with our changing circumstances, climate change \nis a global problem that requires a global response \nbased on the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibility. \n The President took the Chair. \n To that end, some small island and coastal States, \nincluding Belize, are moving resolutely towards low-\ncarbon and no-carbon emission economies. Today, \n24 of our small island developing States (SIDS) have \nbecome partners in an innovative, sustainable energy \ninitiative called SIDS DOCK, aimed at transforming \nour energy sector and catalyzing our sustainable \neconomic development. However, in order to succeed \nin our initiative we will require delivery or transfer of \nthe often promised environmentally friendly \ntechnology and the new and additional funding \npromised by the international community. \n In that regard, we consider the upcoming Durban \nConference on climate change of high importance. We \nbelieve that every effort should be made at the \nConference to forge a climate change regime that will \nincentivize significant emission reductions and the \nprotection and preservation of existing forests, while \nsimultaneously creating disincentives to polluting \nactions. Additionally, clear, legally binding rules must \n  \n \n11-51670 20 \n \nbe hammered out with a view to guaranteeing the \nenvironmental integrity of our countries. \n Over the last decade, crime and violence in \nBelize and the rest of Central America have escalated \ndrastically, resulting in some 18,167 homicides. \nHowever, none of the arms used in those murders was \nproduced in Central America. Those arms are the \nproduct of the illicit trafficking in guns and drugs \nbetween South and North America. The transnational \nnature of those crimes is exacerbated by cross-border \ncollaboration among criminals. Confronting that type \nof criminal activity successfully will clearly require the \ncollaboration and cooperation of the international \ncommunity. \n We in Belize have stepped up our national efforts, \nin conjunction with our neighbours in Central America, \nthe Caribbean and the United States, to combat those \ncriminal activities. But the going is difficult and \nprogress is slow. We need more help from the \ninternational community. Ideally, we would need a \nuniversally applicable normative framework to regulate \nthe trade in arms, such as an arms trade treaty that is \nlegally binding, robust and comprehensive; one that \nestablishes the highest possible standards for the \ntransfer of conventional arms, especially small arms, \nlight weapons and ammunition. \n I now turn to some of the silent killers that are \nravaging our Latin American and Caribbean \ncommunities \u2014 the chronic non-communicable \ndiseases (NCDs), such as hyper-tension, diabetes and \nobesity. In the Caribbean today, NCDs are responsible \nfor 62 per cent of deaths, 40 per cent of which occur \nprematurely. If the current trend continues, \nnon-communicable diseases will account for three out \nof four deaths in the Caribbean by the year 2030.  \n Again, those diseases can be combated \neffectively only through collaborative efforts of the \ninternational community. In that connection, we \nwelcome the conclusion of the recently held High-level \nMeeting on non-communicable diseases (A/66/PV.3 \nand A/66/PV.4), as well as the first comprehensive \nglobal political declaration addressing chronic \nnon-communicable diseases (resolution 66/2). It should \nserve as a template for action at all levels. We will \neagerly await the development of indicators and global \ntargets aimed at achieving a 25 per cent reduction in \nnon-communicable disease-related deaths by 2025. \nThat will, no doubt, necessitate close collaboration and \ncooperation among Governments, international \norganizations, civil society and the private sector to \nfacilitate access to medicines and healthy foods. Belize \nis committed to supporting that initiative \nunconditionally. \n Belize is of the view that, given the quantum and \nscale of the problems which confront the world today \nand the unquestioned need for an ever-increasing \namount of resources, the international community \ncannot afford not to avail itself of every source of \nassistance at hand. And in that regard, we wish to urge \nthat the Republic of China, Taiwan, be allowed to \nparticipate meaningfully in the work of the United \nNations. In a similar vein, we would urge that the \nembargo against Cuba, which the Assembly has \ndenounced for many years, be brought to a speedy end. \n Finally, while Belize appreciates the limitations \nof this United Nations, we also appreciate that there \nexists no better institution than this one, which is \ndedicated to world peace, security, justice and \ndevelopment. And even as we seek its reform, we \nrecognize its primacy in international affairs and global \ngovernance. I am, therefore, pleased to assure you that \nBelize is fully committed to work within this \nOrganization, through it and with it as it carries out its \nmandates."

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to \ntake this opportunity to congratulate the President of \nthis session, who is the Permanent Representative of \nour sister State of Qatar, for his election as President of \nthe sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General \nAssembly. I am confident that his experience in \ninternational political and diplomatic affairs will \ncontribute to the success of this session\u2019s work. I wish \nhim every success. I also wish to commend his \npredecessor, His Excellency Joseph Deiss, for his \noutstanding leadership of the previous session of the \nGeneral Assembly. In addition, I would like to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon on the \nrenewed confidence in him and his reappointment as \nSecretary-General of this international Organization for \na second term. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate the Republic of South \nSudan for joining our international Organization as a \nState Member of the United Nations, along with the \npeople of Libya for their Transitional National \nCouncil\u2019s taking Libya\u2019s seat in the United Nations. \n Addressing enormous international challenges \ndepends on the extent of consolidated and collective \nwork, with the participation of all States, including the \nsmall and developing ones, in international decision-\nmaking structures, institutions and mechanisms, based \non the principles of equality, justice and transparency. \n My country has therefore undertaken extensive \npreventive diplomatic efforts in order to contain the \ntensions and disputes occurring in its surroundings and \nbeyond. The United Arab Emirates vigorously seeks to \nenhance its humanitarian and economical programmes \nto several developing countries, particularly to those \ncountries undergoing conflicts or natural disasters, in \naddition to its other effective contributions to \npeacekeeping operations, protection of civilians, and \nre-building efforts. Those contributions represent our \nsignificant partnership with several parties, and our \ndedication to achieve the noble objectives of \nmaintaining and consolidating international peace and \nsecurity. \n The solid strategic political approach adopted by \nthe United Arab Emirates is not limited to bilateral and \nregional cooperation; it is also evident in the way we \nhandle all issues. My country seeks to establish peace \nand security, eliminate tensions from the region and \nenhance confidence-building measures. We apply the \nsame approach in dealing with the occupation by the \nIslamic Republic of Iran of the three Emirate islands of \nAbu Musa, and the Greater and Lesser Tumbs. Since \nthe illegitimate occupation of those islands in 1971, my \ncountry has adopted a flexible diplomatic approach to \nresolve this issue through peaceful means, either \nthrough direct bilateral negotiations, or by referring the \n  \n \n11-51390 8 \n \nmatter to the International Court of Justice. This has \nbeen our approach throughout the last four decades. \n However, the United Arab Emirates expresses its \ndeep concern over the lack of progress in direct, \nregional and international contacts made so far with the \nIslamic Republic of Iran with a view to reaching a \npeaceful, just and permanent solution. The actions \ntaken by Iran with the aim of changing the legal, \nphysical and demographic situation of the islands are \nnull and void and have no legal effect whatsoever. \nThose Iranian actions also constitute a violation of \ninternational law, as well as of the United Nations \nCharter. Therefore, we call on the Islamic Republic of \nIran to enter into serious and direct negotiations \nbetween the two countries, or to refer the issue to the \nInternational Court of Justice in light of its continuous \nillegal occupation of the three islands, which are an \nintegral part of the territorial sovereignty of the United \nArab Emirates. \n We have been closely monitoring the major \ndevelopments and complications surrounding the \nPalestinian issue, which unfortunately resulted in \nhalting the efforts and chances of resuming peace talks. \nIt is time to resolve this issue in all its humanitarian, \nlegal and political aspects. The core of the solution for \nthis issue lies in the establishment of a full-fledged \nsovereign State within the 4 June 1967 borders, with \nEast Jerusalem as its capital. Comprehensive and just \npeace between Arab countries and Israel would greatly \nassist in reducing tensions and deprive the voices of \nextremism and violence from using this ongoing issue \nas a major justifications for their extremism and \nviolence.  \n My country has been closely monitoring the \nrecent events in the brotherly Kingdom of Bahrain, \nwhich have adversely affected its peace and stability. \nWhile we are extending every required support to the \nKingdom of Bahrain, we denounce any external \nintervention in Bahrain\u2019s internal affairs. \n We believe that the measures and good efforts \nundertaken by His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa \nAl Khalifa of Bahrain to promote national dialogue \namong all segments of Bahraini society are important \nsteps that seek to maintain peace and stability in the \nKingdom, preserve civil peace, strengthen national \nunity and pursue reforms and progress, in a manner \nthat will realize the hopes and aspirations of all the \npeople of Bahrain.  \n We emphasize that the sovereignty, security and \nterritorial integrity of the Kingdom of Bahrain are an \nintegral part of the security and stability of the Arabian \nGulf region, and also part of the responsibilities of the \nArab Gulf Cooperation Council in the region. All \nmembers of the Council are keen to consolidate good \nneighbourly relations with all States, based on the \nprinciples of international law and other international \ninstruments. \n The United Arab Emirates renews through this \ninternational platform its full commitment to the \nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and \nnational unity of Libya. We also stress our commitment \nto Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 \n(2011) with regard to the protection of civilians. Since \nthe beginning of the Libyan crisis, we have focused on \nthe humanitarian assistance aspect and the protection \nof civilians. We realized these goals within the efforts \nof the international community. We will continue to \nsupport Libya and its people in the upcoming \nreconstruction phase. We believe that the honourable \npeople of Libya and its leadership are capable of \nidentifying the characteristics of next phase in order to \nenhance Libya\u2019s stature within the international \ncommunity and strengthen its development and \nstability. To this end, my country calls on our \ninternational partners to intensify their efforts to \nrelease the remaining Libyan frozen assets.  \n My country has also made substantial direct \ncontributions for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, for \nrestoring peace and stability in the country and for \nalleviating the suffering of its people. Success in this \nregard will be a focal point in countering extremism, \nmilitancy, and international terrorism in the Arabian \nGulf region. In addition, peace and security in \nAfghanistan have a direct impact on regional security \nand on the security of the Arab Gulf region. From this \nplatform, I call on all Afghani parties to cooperate in \nachieving a process of comprehensive national \nreconciliation and extending the control of the \nGovernment over all Afghani regions. We also look \nforward to the international conference on Afghanistan \nto be held in Bonn next December.  \n Food security is one of the biggest challenges \nfacing the world today. It is estimated that in 2010 \nmore than 900 million people worldwide suffered from \nchronic hunger. The recent tragedy of famine in the \nHorn of Africa has demonstrated the urgent need for \nconcrete efforts on the part of the international \n \n \n9 11-51390 \n \ncommunity to ensure protection for the most \nvulnerable peoples in times of crisis. \n In a serious discussion of the issue of food \nsecurity, we cannot overlook the significance of water \nsecurity, especially in view of the fact that agricultural \nproduction consumes around 70 per cent of fresh water \nresources globally. My country therefore deems it \nimportant to include the issue of water scarcity and \nsecurity in future plans aimed at increasing food \nproduction worldwide. Living as we do in a region that \nsuffers from a scarcity of water, we are more aware of \nits importance, which prompts us to stress the need for \nthe international community to tackle this challenge \ndecisively and urgently. \n In December, my country will celebrate its \nfortieth anniversary. One of the major successes and \npositive indicators of human development that we have \nachieved has been the advancement and empowerment \nof Emirati women. With the support of our leadership \nand society, we have been able to arrive at the optimum \nbalance between our traditions and the demands of \ndevelopment and participation required to build our \nsociety. In this context, I would like to take the \nopportunity commend the establishment of the United \nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women (UN-Women). In support of \nthis newly established and promising entity, the United \nArab Emirates hereby announces its contribution of \n$5 million to the UN-Women fund. \n In conclusion, we hope that our deliberations at \nthis session of the Assembly will contribute to the \npromotion and development of all forms of \nunderstanding, solidarity and international cooperation \naimed at addressing the global issues on our agenda."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to \ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \nassumption of the post of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of the \nfullest cooperation of the Latvian delegation. I also \ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his re-appointment \nto his honourable post for a second term. I wish him the \ngreatest success and strength in guiding the Organization \nand the Secretariat in all their complex tasks. \n I warmly welcome the State of South Sudan as \nthe 193rd Member of the United Nations. \n Latvia has always supported strengthening the \nUnited Nations as the only truly universal international \norganization. However, the United Nations must \nchange and adapt to the new realities in order to deliver \nthe best results and sustain its influence. The \nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the reform \nof other principal organs are essential so that the \nUnited Nations can keep pace with the modern realities \nin the world and to make the whole of its work more \neffective. That will allow consistent adherence to the \nprinciples of sound budgetary discipline and a fair \ndistribution of expenses among the Member States.  \n In the context of the global economic slowdown, \nwe welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General to \ncut the United Nations budget for 2012-2013 by 3 per \ncent, and we look forward to a constructive discussion \non that matter. \n The reform of the Security Council is long \noverdue. We call on all partners to work sincerely on \nthis important issue. Latvia is ready to assume greater \ninternational responsibility and is planning to engage \n \n \n25 11-50702 \n \nmore actively in the Council\u2019s work by putting forward \nits candidature for a non-permanent seat. \n This year marks the twentieth anniversary of \nLatvia\u2019s joining the United Nations, after regaining \nindependence. In those 20 years we have undergone a \ncomplete transformation. From a Soviet-occupied \nEuropean country with no trace on the political map, \nLatvia has re-emerged as a country with stable \ndemocratic institutions and membership in the United \nNations, the European Union and NATO. From a \nclosed, regulated system we have developed an open, \nliberal market economy. From a totalitarian regime we \nhave grown into a democratic society where the rule of \nlaw and human rights are respected. Now we are able \nto share our transformation experience by helping other \ncountries in their own development. \n Important changes, often called the Arab Spring, \nhave started in North Africa and the Middle East. \nPeople have gone to the streets demanding democratic \nreforms and influence on the future development of \ntheir countries. The international community has to \nsupport those aspirations and assist in building stable \nand trusted democratic institutions and establishing the \nrule of law. \n We welcome the timely reaction of the United \nNations to the events in Libya, such as the Security \nCouncil\u2019s decision to provide humanitarian and \nsecurity assistance and to refer the case to the \nInternational Criminal Court. Latvia has recognized the \nNational Transitional Council of Libya and supported \nthe General Assembly decision to allow the Council to \nrepresent Libya at this session. Joint action is crucial, \nand we hope that the United Nations, in collaboration \nwith relevant regional actors, will continue to play a \nleading role in Libya. \n We support the Security Council presidential \nstatement regarding the events in Syria \n(S/PRST/2011/16) and the Human Rights Council \ndecision to urgently dispatch a special mission to Syria \n(A/HRC/RES/S-16/1). The message is clear: violations \nof human rights and the use of force against civilians \nare totally unacceptable and strongly condemned by \nthe international community. We look forward to an \nappropriate follow-up on this issue in the Security \nCouncil. \n Today the international community has a historic \nresponsibility to make the Middle East a safer, more \nprosperous and more democratic place to live. We must \nsupport the Middle East peace process with the goal of \ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in \npeace and security. Latvia strongly encourages both \nsides to resume dialogue without delay. Sustainable \npeace is possible only if the Israelis and the \nPalestinians reach an agreement that takes into account \nthe legitimate interests of both sides. The international \ncommunity \u2014 the United Nations, the Quartet, the \nArab League and others \u2014 should act together to help \nboth sides to return to the negotiation table. \n Turning to sustainable development, I would like \nto stress that we have a responsibility to future \ngenerations for the preservation of the natural \nenvironment in the world. That responsibility includes \nan obligation to ensure that the resources available to \nus now are used in the most appropriate ways.  \n In order to address the challenges posed by \nclimate change, joint global action is needed with \nregard to emissions reduction and global warming. \nLater this year, the next United Nations Climate \nChange Conference, in Durban, will take important \ndecisions. Any proposed agreement on climate change \naction should be a reasonable compromise that is \nacceptable for the majority of participating Parties and \ndoes not exclude any of the major economies. \n In order to achieve sustainable development, \nprotecting the environment and preserving a healthy \nsociety are most important. However, in the twenty-\nfirst century we face a new challenge: non-communicable \ndiseases. We commend the High-level Meeting on the \nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable \nDiseases and the adoption of the Political Declaration \n(resolution 66/2, annex). We hope that we will have an \neffective follow-up process. \n The economic crisis has reminded us that we live \nin an interdependent world. We are deeply worried by \nthe level of uncertainty and volatility in international \ntrade and financial markets. The primary responsibility \nfor prudent governance is at a national level. However, \nin the current situation the international community \nmust once again act together and find sustainable \nstabilization measures in order to prevent another \ndownturn in the global economy. \n My country, Latvia, was one of those hit first and \nhard by the crisis but now is among the countries that \nare steadily recovering. Our gross domestic product is \ngrowing again and unemployment is falling. The \nrecovery of the Latvian economy can teach us several \n  \n \n11-50702 26 \n \nsimple lessons. First is the importance of acting \nquickly and decisively in adopting austerity measures. \nSecondly, in order to carry out structural reforms, there \nis a strong need to communicate and to engage with \nsociety. The third and final lesson, of course, is the \nvalue of international solidarity. \n We face a large number of transnational threats, \nincluding terrorism. This year, we commemorate the \ntenth anniversary of the tragic terrorist attacks of \n11 September 2001. We express our solidarity and \nsympathy with the victims of 9/11 and others who have \nbeen affected by terrorism all over the world. \n As we combat terrorism, we must also analyse its \nroot causes. Our aim in Afghanistan is to help to \nstabilize the security situation and to build local \ndemocratic institutions. That will empower the Afghan \nGovernment to take over responsibility for security \nthroughout the country by 2014. A sustainable solution \nin Afghanistan can be found only if regional actors, \nincluding the Central Asian countries, are part of the \nprocess. Joint action is needed to unlock economic \nopportunities, to strengthen regional security \ncooperation and to develop infrastructure and transport \ncorridors in order to connect Afghanistan with the \nregion and the rest of the world. \n In addition to the role of the United Nations in \nmaintaining international peace and security, the \nimportance of regional organizations is increasing. In \nthat context, we draw attention to the protracted \nconflicts in Europe in Transdniestria, Abkhazia, South \nOssetia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Regional \norganizations \u2014 in this case, the EU and the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope \u2014 must continue working to seek peaceful \nsolutions. Good cooperation with the United Nations is \ncrucial. \n In that regard, let me emphasize the principled \nand consistent position of Latvia and the EU in \nsupporting the peaceful settlement of conflicts and \nvalues such as democracy, the rule of law and the \nprotection of human rights. Those lie at the core of the \nEU foreign policy strategy. \n This year, we carried out the review process of \nthe functioning of the main United Nations human \nrights body \u2014 the Human Rights Council. Latvia saw \nthat review process as a unique opportunity to improve \nthe performance and credibility of that important body. \nWe took note of the outcome of the review process \n(resolution 65/281, annex). However, we believe that \nmuch more could have been done to enable the Council \nto live up to the expectations of countries and people. \n Latvia believes that members of the Human \nRights Council must lead by example through full \ncommitment to the promotion and protection of human \nrights. Latvia attaches the greatest importance to that \ncommitment by putting forward its candidacy for the \nHuman Rights Council elections in the year 2014. \n Challenges to global security, development and \nhuman rights can be overcome only by our joint \nefforts. Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "The \nChadian delegation warmly congratulates the President \non his election to the presidency of the Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session and assures him of its cooperation \nand support as he carries out his noble endeavours.  \n I also express my delegation\u2019s admiration for his \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, who skilfully guided \nthe Assembly\u2019s work during the sixty-fifth session. \n Finally, Chad pays tribute the Secretary-General, \nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his work on the \ndevelopment front and towards peace in the world. We \nreiterate to him our warmest congratulations on his \nwell-deserved re-election to a second term at the helm \nof our Organization. \n My delegation welcomes the choice of the central \ntheme for our general debate, \u201cThe role of mediation in \nthe settlement of disputes\u201d. This theme is fully \nconsistent with our own political vision, our \nconvictions and our philosophy of a harmonious and \negalitarian world.  \n Chad has made its own modest contribution in \nsupporting the efforts of the State of Qatar, the United \nNations and the international community by \nparticipating at the highest level in the negotiations and \nconclusion of the Doha Framework Agreement for the \nResolution of the Conflict in Darfur between the \nSudanese Government and the armed opposition in \nDarfur. We sincerely hope that this crisis will finally be \nresolved. To that end, the Sudan should be supported \nby the entire international community, so that peace \nand security can be restored throughout the country \nand in the subregion.  \n Furthermore, we are concerned by the hotbeds of \ntension that are spreading throughout the world and \nthat sometimes stem from the profound changes taking \nplace, particularly in some countries of the Middle East \nand in the Maghreb. That process is often described as \nthe Arab Spring. \n Our Organization must be resolute in its \ncommitment to stand with the parties to conflict, as \npart of efforts to find solutions based on reconciliation \nand forgiveness. In addition to the losses of human life \n  \n \n11-50871 30 \n \nthat we have witnessed, we should also mention the \nfact that dramatic circumstances such as these also \nresult in the inevitable streams of refugees and the \ndisplaced. And when we speak of refugees and \ndisplaced persons, we are talking about misery and \nterrible suffering. We are well qualified to discuss this \nissue, given that Chad is now hosting more than \n100,000 refugees from Central Africa in the south-\nwestern part of the country and more than 290,000 \nSudanese refugees and 180,000 Chadian displaced \npersons in the east. They have been living in this \nsituation since 2003, in precarious environmental and \nsocial conditions. \n We call on the international community to show \nsolidarity and to assist us in assuming responsibility \nfor all Chadian displaced persons. In the wake of the \nfull withdrawal last March of the United Nations \nMission in the Central African Republic and Chad \n(MINURCAT), the Chadian Government assumed \nresponsibility for the protection of refugees and \ndisplaced persons, as well as of the humanitarian \norganizations that are assisting them, by setting up a \nspecial national force known as the D\u00e9tachement \nint\u00e9gr\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. It is to be hoped that our partners \nwill continue to deploy efforts alongside us and \ncomplement them with the financial and logistical \nsupport necessary to the proper functioning of that \nforce. \n In addition, like a number of other Sahel \ncountries, Chad has witnessed the return from Libya, in \nvery dangerous conditions, of almost 100,000 of its \nnationals who were forced to leave Libya in a state of \nutter destitution. I should like to take this opportunity \nto thank the International Organization for Migration \nand other institutions as well as all those countries that \nhave assisted us in repatriating and providing \nassistance to our nationals. Our deepest desire is for \npeace to return to Libya so that the killing can end and \nthe Libyans can reconcile in the framework of the \nNational Transitional Council in order to build a State \nbased on the rule of law and democracy. \n In connection with the building of a new Libya, \nwe would draw the attention of our Libyan brothers to \nthe situation of those of our citizens who, despite \nhaving contributed to the development of that country \nas immigrant workers, are sometimes referred to \nindiscriminately as mercenaries. In addition, we wish \nto express our great concern about the fate of the \n400,000 Chadians who remain trapped in Libya. We \ncall on the new Libyan authorities urgently to take \nmeasures aimed at fulfilling its commitment to protect \nimmigrants. \n Chad would also like to share with the Assembly \nour views on current issues of common concern, a \nnumber of which are being discussed in meetings \nduring this session. These are mainly problems that \naffect international solidarity. They include the \nhandling of economic and environmental crises as well \nas the security situation in our region. These issues \ndirectly affect our daily lives in that they hinder or \neven stall our development efforts, particularly in the \ncase of countries emerging from conflict, such as Chad. \nThe aftermath of those crises will certainly jeopardize \nthe implementation of our development strategies and \nour capacity to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015. \n Chad, which has lived through decades of \nexternal attacks, cannot achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals unless it receives substantial \nsupport through, inter alia, the Heavily Indebted Poor \nCountries initiative. For that reason, we have \nrepeatedly called for support from the relevant \ninternational institutions.  \n One of the consequences of climate change is that \nthis year the Sahel area saw low levels of rainfall, \nwhich could lead to an environmental and humanitarian \ncatastrophe such as the one that we have seen in recent \nmonths in the Horn of Africa. \n We commend all of the initiatives undertaken by \nthe Organization to promote international solidarity \nwith our countries through high-level meetings and \nsummits, including the United Nations Conference on \nthe Least Developed Countries, held in Istanbul, and \nupcoming conferences on combating desertification \nand on sustainable development, to be held in Korea \nand in Rio de Janeiro, respectively. \n Among the other major initiatives that we have \nundertaken, I would like to stress in particular those \nrelating to free emergency health care, maternal and \nchild health, communicable diseases such as \nHIV/AIDS and malaria, and free education at all levels. \nOur policies on gender and on the empowerment of \nyouth remain the cornerstone of our vision of a new \nChad that is moving ahead and making progress. \n Finally, of all the challenges facing us, the issue \nof sustainable development remains a priority. Indeed, \n \n \n31 11-50871 \n \nfollowing the holding in Chad in June 2010 of a \nmeeting on the Great Green Wall initiative by the \ncountries of the Sahel, our country in October 2010 \nconvened the eighth World Forum on Sustainable \nDevelopment on the theme \u201cSave Lake Chad\u201d. The \naction plans that emerged from those meetings are \nbeing publicized so as to ensure support for their \nimplementation. We call once again on the \ninternational community to assist those countries \nlocated on the banks of Lake Chad to help save the \nlake, because the world should know that the future of \nthe Congo Basin forest depends on its survival, as does \nthe combat against desertification.  \n The question of Palestine has been outstanding \nfor far too long, and its impact on regional and global \nsecurity influence is felt daily. There is therefore an \nurgent need for an international consensus on the issue \nof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. We \nbelieve that the time has come to recognize a State of \nPalestine living side by side with the State of Israel. \nWe must have the courage to move forward in this \ndirection, which is essential in order to bring about \npeace between the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples. \nFor that reason, I call on all peace- and justice-loving \ncountries to commit themselves to that end. \n Finally, we would like once again to touch on the \nissue of the reform of the United Nations, one of whose \ncharacteristics is the marginalization of a large part of \nhumankind; I refer here to the African people. African \nStates, individually and collectively, are today key \nplayers in terms of peace, security and development. \nUnfortunately, it has to be said that they have not yet \nassumed their full role within the system, because of, \ninter alia, their marginalization in the context of \ninitiatives aimed at resolving certain conflicts that pose \na threat to peace and security on our continent. \n United Nations reform is absolutely necessary, \nand we should accelerate the process, in consideration \nof the claims and legitimate hopes of Africans, whose \nmain concern is to fulfil the right of the African \ncontinent to be represented on the Security Council by \na permanent seat with veto power. That is the only way \nfor Africa to effectively contribute to conflict \nprevention and settlement and to the maintenance of \npeace in the world at large and on the African continent \nin particular."

        "file_text": "I bring warm greetings from the \npeople of Kiribati, on whose behalf I address the \nAssembly. I wish to join previous speakers in \ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsixth session.  \n We gather here every year as world leaders to \nrepresent our peoples and to discuss issues of concern \nto the global community. At this session our theme is \nthe role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means, which is appropriate in its reminder to \nus that peace and security are indeed crucial to the \ncontinued harmonious existence of mankind on this \nplanet. \n As a global community we constantly face many \nchallenges to our political, social and economic \nstability. Natural and human-induced disasters have \ncaused much suffering in different regions of the \nworld. Countries and peoples are facing all kinds of \nsecurity threats from armed conflicts, terrorism, human \ntrafficking, economic recession, climate change and its \nassociated impacts. As a result, many communities \nsuffer daily from increasing poverty, hunger and \ndislocation. \n But how can all this be happening in a \nsupposedly rational world community under the \nscrutiny of this global body? Is our existing \nOrganization in its current form equipped to deal with \nthese emerging issues, or is it time to review the \nstructure and effectiveness of our international \ngovernance system?  \n The lack of progress on climate change \nnegotiations clearly demonstrates the wide divergence \n  \n \n11-51191 30 \n \nof positions on the issue. I believe that unless we can \napproach any mediation with trust and commitment, \nwe will be caught in the vicious circle of starting with \nour differences, in our obsession to protect what we \nperceive to be our critical national interests. \n I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \nhis comments based on his experience during his recent \nvisit to Kiribati. His views are those of an independent \nobserver who came, who saw and who believed. His \ncomments are a powerful endorsement of what we, the \nmost vulnerable countries, have been saying over the \nyears, and my hope is that this will communicate the \nneed for urgent action to all who possess a sense of \nmoral responsibility. Climate change will remain the \ncurse of our planet. Most nations perceive it to be a \nfuture event, but for the very few it is already reaching \ndisastrous levels. \n Some will argue that climate change does not fall \nwithin the conventional definition of a security threat, \nbut that is simply because it may not be so for them at \nthis point in time. In Kiribati, many young people go to \nsleep each night fearing what may happen to their \nhomes overnight, especially during very high tides. \nThe accelerated and continued erosion of our shoreline \nis destroying settlements, and as I speak, some \ncommunities are relocating on the island. I was glad \nthat the Secretary-General was able to understand and \nfeel for himself the sense of threat that our people and \nthose of similarly vulnerable countries experience on a \ndaily basis. \n In the international climate-change forums there \nis ongoing dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to \nfind amicable solutions to this threat. But there is an \nongoing disagreement on how to address this global \nchallenge. The question is: how much longer must we \ncontinue to argue about this? When are we going to do \nsomething about it? Our people and our children, \nwhose lives and future are under serious threat, look to \nus for leadership. The urgency of the need for action \ncannot be overemphasized.  \n At Canc\u00fan, it was my understanding that there \nwas agreement on the need for an urgent package to \naddress the situation of the most vulnerable countries, \nwhich are now being seriously affected by the adverse \nimpacts of climate change. Next year, we will gather \nagain as world leaders to take stock of what we have \ndone since the Rio Summit in 1992. It is my fervent \nhope that, in the light of current scientific evidence and \nbased on the experiences of the most vulnerable \ncountries, we as a global community will embark on \nbold and innovative initiatives to address the climate \nchange challenge. I acknowledge with gratitude the \nadoption of resolutions 63/281 and 65/159 on the \npossible security implications of climate change and \nthe protection of our global climate for present and \nfuture generations. And I thank those who saw and \nsupported the need to classify climate change as a \nsecurity issue. \n In December, there will be another United \nNations Climate Change Conference in Durban. I \nacknowledge that climate change negotiations will take \nseveral years to conclude, but I also believe that there \nis common ground on which there is no real debate. \nThe urgent need for the flow of adaptation funds to \naddress the more urgent adaptation needs of the most \nvulnerable countries is a matter on which I believe \nthere is general consensus. But what is the point in \nconsensus if no concrete action follows? Kiribati was \none of the countries that did not sign the Copenhagen \nAccord because of what we saw as its serious \nshortcomings, but we were subsequently persuaded to \nassociate ourselves with it on the premise that doing so \nwould trigger the flow of much-needed adaptation \nfunds that had been pledged. Today, we continue to \nawait those funds. \n We all want to achieve sustainable development. \nWe are grateful to those who have continued to assist \nand partner with us on this journey, but our efforts at \nachieving sustainable growth will continue to be \nfrustrated by external factors. Ongoing uncertainty in \nthe global economic climate and rising food and fuel \nprices remain major challenges to our sustainable \ndevelopment efforts. On top of all that, our increasing \npreoccupation with the impacts of climate change will \nprogressively dominate our national agenda.  \n It is no surprise, therefore, that we continue to be \noff track in the achievement of most of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the implementation of our \nsustainable development agenda under our national \ndevelopment plan. Every step we take forward we are \nknocked back two or three due to the many challenges \nwe face. It is therefore imperative that climate change \nadaptation funds be mobilized at the earliest \nopportunity. Otherwise, we will be forced to divert \ndevelopment resources towards the most urgent \nadaptation needs. Therefore, as we move towards \nDurban, it is our hope that the Green Climate Fund can \n \n \n31 11-51191 \n \nbe operationalized as soon as possible to allow the \nmost vulnerable countries to attend to their adaptation \nneeds from new resources. \n In the same vein, we believe that all nations and \npeoples \u2014 including Taiwan \u2014 that play a role in \ninternational affairs, including contributing to climate \nchange, should also be part of the solution. During \nthese difficult times, and facing challenges to our \nexisting world order, we can ill afford to isolate any \nnation that has the capacity to assist in our struggles.  \n I believe that, as a global community, we must be \nunited in our efforts to address any security threat to \ninternational peace and security, be it within States or \nbetween States. We need to forge consensus in our \ncollective action to promote and maintain our \ncollective security. Let us work together as a global \ncommunity to address the many conflicts and disputes \nthat are posing serious security challenges to our well-\nbeing, before they consume and condemn our \ncivilization to oblivion. \n In closing, I share our traditional blessing of \nhealth, peace and prosperity."

        "file_text": "Italy has a long tradition of \nmediation that has shaped our history and our approach \nto international affairs. In the celebrations of the \n150th anniversary of Italian unification this year, we \ncommemorated the vision of the founding fathers of \nour nation and the sacrifices of so many patriots. We \nalso recalled the role of mediation in bridging the gap \nbetween the aspirations for independence and the \nreality of foreign occupation.  \n A century or so after unification, our vocation for \nmediation was fulfilled when we were among the first \ncountries to launch the process of European \npacification. We helped restore peace and prosperity to \na war-torn continent by engaging Governments in \ndialogue rather than disputes. \n Our attitude to mediation is inspired by both our \nhistory and our geography. Our territory is located \nright at the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, making us \nkeenly aware that our security is not independent of \nthat of the region surrounding us. \n For decades, Italy has emphasized the need to \nbridge the economic and social gap between the \nconditions of the northern shores of the Mediterranean \nand the expectations of our neighbours to the south. \nDespite this vision, we tended to overlook the \naspirations for civil and political rights of the peoples \nof North Africa and the Middle East, peoples so close \nto us geographically but far apart in terms of the rights \nenjoyed by our citizens.  \n  \n \n11-51378 10 \n \n On the face of it, the approach favoured by \nEuropean and the other Western countries \u2014 including \nthe United States \u2014 was to forge partnerships with \nundemocratic regimes and place a priority on security, \ncounter-terrorism cooperation and migration policy. We \nmade a mistake. \n The Arab Spring was a wake-up call, reminding \nus that no political leader can maintain power at the \nexpense of his or her own people. It confirmed the \nprinciple that there can be no mediation or compromise \nwhere fundamental rights are concerned. And it \nshowed that cooperation for the sake of security and \nstability is no alternative to promoting freedom, \neconomic and democratic growth and job creation. \n Our response to the uprisings was consistent with \nour values. We called for dialogue and deplored the use \nof force against civilians. That was not enough in \nLibya, however, where the regime had vowed to \nslaughter its own civilians. The only way to prevent a \nmassacre was for the international community to \ninvoke the principle of the responsibility to protect. \n By helping to implement that decision in military, \ndiplomatic and humanitarian terms, we shifted from a \nculture of sovereign impunity to one of responsible \nsovereignty, rooted in national and international \naccountability for the most serious violations of human \nrights. At the same time, we supported international \nsanctions against the Syrian leadership. \n The uprisings in North Africa and in the Middle \nEast send a message that the United Nations can do \nmore and do better. Let me be very clear. We do not \nwant less United Nations involvement; we want more. \nLibya can be the first test case for a more prominent \nUnited Nations role.  \n The United Nations is called upon to coordinate \nand lead the international community\u2019s assistance to \nthat country. The international community should \nmaintain cohesion and unity of purpose, avoid a \nfragmented response and resist engaging in a first-past-\nthe-post logic. There should be no competition, \nbecause there is only one winner: the Libyan people.  \n The United Nations should therefore chair the \ninternational coordination mechanisms, with the \nsupport of the relevant regional organizations, such as \nthe League of Arab States, the African Union and the \nEuropean Union (EU). At this juncture we need to \nprevent resentment and extremism from gaining \nground.  \n We are ready to build respectful new partnerships \nwithout imposing pre-packaged models. That is why \nwe have promoted the idea of a new Mediterranean \nplan for growth and development. And we have \nproposed a permanent conference on security and \ncooperation, with the goal of building an inclusive \ndialogue among equals on political, economic and \ncultural issues. If we fail to respond, and if the Arab \nSpring does not produce results soon, we will all have \na heavy price to pay. \n Never has mediation been more necessary in the \ntense stand-off between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians. Confrontation has led nowhere. The time \nhas come to defuse this long-standing and disruptive \nconflict through recourse to dialogue and the building \nof mutual trust. We continue to strongly back American \nefforts, and we welcome the Quartet\u2019s new effort to \ngather the necessary support to restart the negotiations \nbetween the parties towards the creation, very soon, of \na strong and safe Palestinian State.  \n Within the European Union, which has to speak \nwith one voice, Italy is also ready to exercise more \nleadership and political vision in relaunching the peace \nprocess.  \n In Lebanon, Italy is playing a prominent role in \nmediation. The Italian contingent in the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon was awarded the United \nNations peace medal for its contribution to maintaining \npeace and stability in the country. This prize honours \nthe achievements of our soldiers in Lebanon, but also \nthe commitment of the Italian Government to \npeacekeeping.  \n Italy is the sixth top contributor to the United \nNations peacekeeping operations budget and, since \n2006, the top EU and Western European and Others \nGroup contributor of troops to the United Nations. \n In Africa far too many people are still grappling \nwith the serious problems caused by regional conflicts. \nThose conflicts undermine stability and prosperity for \nmillions of people, spreading the poisonous seed of \nterrorism and piracy.  \n As a witness to the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement (CPA) between North and South Sudan, \nItaly welcomed the Agreement\u2019s implementation, \nwhich has led to the birth of the new State of South \n \n \n11 11-51378 \n \nSudan. This achievement should be an incentive to \nsettle the post-CPA arrangements without further delay. \n In the Horn of Africa, Italy has a traditional \ncommitment to contributing to peace, security and \ndevelopment. In the past few months, we have financed \nprojects in many sectors: health, education, nutrition, \ntraining, governance support, peace and security. But \nour assistance is not enough. In Somalia people are \nfacing starvation and humanitarian disaster. \nInternational support must be stepped up to deliver \nbasic services to the population and foster political \nreconciliation. \n The United Nations collective security system is \nadapting its structure and practices to the new \nchallenges by making good and flexible use of its \nfundamental, cost-effective tools. Mediation is one of \nthem. We are among the sponsors of the draft \nresolution on strengthening the role of mediation in the \npeaceful settlement of disputes. \n We also encourage the United Nations to play a \nmore significant role in conflict prevention, the \nsettlement of disputes and peacebuilding efforts. To \nthat end, we rely on the impartiality and authority of \nthe Secretary-General. We commend him for his \nleadership in crisis management, and encourage him in \nthis noble endeavour and in his commitment to \nbudgetary discipline. \n We also commend all the efforts to promote a \nstrong solution to the reform of the Security Council, a \nreform inspired by the United Nations core principles \nof democracy, accountability, consensus and flexibility \u2014 a \nreform that will gather the widest majority and with \nwhich each and every Member State can identify. \n Our humanistic heritage defines the human being \nas the measure of all things. The principle of placing \npeople first underpins our active support for United \nNations campaigns on fundamental issues such as the \nabolition of the death penalty, the protection of the \nfreedom of religion or belief and the ending of the \npractice of female genital mutilation. The people-first \napproach also entails mediation between the pressing \nneed for modernization and the goal of improving \nindividual quality of life.  \n We need to enhance food security by tackling the \ncrucial links between speculation, inflation of food \nprices, and instability. We can count on the new bodies \ncreated in the framework of the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations and the Rome-\nbased United Nations agencies to reduce food price \nvolatility and its very negative impact on the most \nvulnerable people. \n We also pay close attention to urban development \nand environmental sustainability, promoting important \ninternational events such as the World Urban Forum, \nwhich will be held next year in Italy, and a world \nconference on the topic of the inter-ethnic city. \n In conclusion, Italy wants to place the rights of \nhuman beings, and the environment in which we live, \nat the centre of society. True to this principle, Italy \nwants to help create and consolidate a modern \nhumanism. There could be no better defence against \nthe hatred and criminal intolerance that struck this city, \nthis country and the world 10 years ago."

I also \nwant to express our gratitude to his predecessor, \nMr. Joseph Deiss, for the competent and impartial \nmanner in which he conducted the proceedings of the \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session.  \n Allow me to also congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral on his reappointment and to assure him of my \nGovernment\u2019s support for the success of his very \ncomplex and demanding mission in the service of \npeace and cooperation among nations, a cornerstone of \nthe mandate embodied in the Charter of the \nOrganization. \n We congratulate the Republic of South Sudan on \nits admission as a Member of the United Nations. We \nwish South Sudan a future of peace and prosperity and \nwould like to say that the Government of Angola \nstands ready to cooperate with this new State\u2019s efforts \nto consolidate its independence and its socio-economic \ndevelopment. \n We also welcome the establishment of \nUN-Women. We are certain that it will give further \nimpetus to the promotion and empowerment of women \nand the achievement of their legitimate rights. \n This session of the General Assembly takes place \nat a particularly complex juncture in the international \nsituation, which is characterized by so many crises that \n \n \n11 11-51398 \n \nI believe it is not an exaggeration to say that they \nchallenge the very foundations of our international \nOrganization. If we were to list them, although not \nexhaustively, we could mention the current economic \nand financial crisis, which triggered the most serious \nsocial crisis witnessed to date by our generation; a \ndangerous environmental crisis of unpredictable \nconsequences for the future of humankind, which will \nbe irreversible unless the international community as a \nwhole applies immediate and courageous measures; \nand a general escalation of violence and outbreak of \nconflict, which, combined with the environmental \ncrisis, has caused the most serious humanitarian crisis \nthat humankind has witnessed since the end of the \nSecond World War. In brief, we are living in dangerous \ntimes, where a combination of factors is endangering \nstability, peace and security in the world. \n The analysis of the current international situation \nmade by the majority of the speakers who preceded \nme, and which we agree with, constitutes an appeal to \nour collective responsibility. \n A particularly disturbing factor is the current \neconomic and financial crisis, which has affected \nvirtually every country in the world, in particular \ndeveloping countries, with serious consequences for \npolitical stability and social cohesion. \n It is therefore urgent that we find solutions to \nthese problems. That will require strengthening \ninternational cooperation on the basis of greater justice \nand equality. Moreover, it is urgent that we take \nmeasures aimed at deepening economic reforms within \nStates that promote economic growth and social \ndevelopment. \n Angola is extensively affected by the \ninternational economic and financial crisis. We have \ntherefore adopted a set of measures to mitigate its most \nadverse effects. Without prejudice to the maintenance \nof macroeconomic balance, we have focused \nconsiderable resources on social development and \ncombating poverty. \n The theme of this session of the General \nAssembly \u2014 \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement \nof disputes through peaceful means\u201d \u2014 reflects the \ndeep concern of the international community with \nregard to the need for an integrated approach to \nresolving conflicts that affect it. That is what makes it \nnecessary to implement mediation efforts after \nconflicts have started. Conflict prevention should be \nthe key element in the management of any area of \ntension. \n Respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, the \nrule of law and good governance are key elements in \nensuring that any human society can live in peace and \nharmony. They are also the main guarantors of \neffective conflict prevention. \n There are other elements I would like to mention \nthat are also important causes of the spread of conflict. \nI am referring here to external interference, which, in \ngross violation of international law, frequently \nobstructs efforts at mediation and peaceful resolution \nand prevents the reaching of solutions to conflicts. \n Angola has paid a very high price as a result of \nsuch interference, which for too long compounded a \nfratricidal conflict that Angolans were finally able to \nsettle and wisely overcome with magnanimity, fairness \nand inclusion, thanks to the leadership of our President. \nThe role of Angola and its contribution to internal and \nregional peace should be seen in the broader context of \nconflict resolution. In that regard, the implementation \nof the landmark Security Council resolution 435 (1978) \nled to the independence of Namibia and created the \nconditions for peaceful coexistence in a region that had \nendured extreme hostility and constituted a permanent \nthreat to world peace. \n Imbued with a spirit of fraternity, the \nGovernment of Angola has spared no effort in pursuing \nits policy of effective reconciliation, which has allowed \nthe reconciliation of all its children who were \npreviously involved in the conflict. There has been \ngenuine investment in peace, which has been a decisive \nfactor in the process of post-conflict reconstruction. \nAngola has served as a reference point for the \nresolution of several conflicts on the African continent. \nMoreover, we have spared no effort in sharing our \nexperiences with other peoples and countries.  \n Also in the context of conflict resolution, it is \nimportant to strengthen the role of multilateralism \nwhile adhering to the principle of shared responsibility \nand shared benefits, recognizing the legitimate \ninterests of all parties and engaging in consultations \nand dialogue in the search for workable solutions to \ninternational peace and security issues. \n There is therefore a need to refer to the \ninstruments of cooperation between the Security \nCouncil and the African Union, as well as to the role of \n  \n \n11-51398 12 \n \nthe United Nations and regional institutions in \npreventing and resolving conflicts. It is of crucial \nimportance to strengthen the action of regional \norganizations in the management of situations that may \nconstitute threats to peace and security. In that \nconnection, the Security Council has the primary role \nin preventing and resolving conflicts and in \nmaintaining peace, in accordance with the powers \nconferred upon it by the Charter of the United Nations.  \n The central theme of our debate has drawn \nattention to the need for reform of the Security \nCouncil, including the imperative of achieving fair \nrepresentation for all regions and increasing the \nnumber of permanent members, thereby adapting the \nCouncil to contemporary reality. \n With regard to peaceful cooperation at the \nregional level, Angola is a member of the Southern \nAfrican Development Community (SADC), the \nEconomic Community of Central African States, the \nGulf of Guinea Commission and the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), which, with \nseveral partners, has acted on the basis of preventive \ndiplomacy in the search for peaceful solutions to the \nvarious crises that have arisen. \n With regard to the constitutional crisis in \nMadagascar, SADC mediated the recent signing by all \nparties involved of the road map for the \nimplementation of the reconciliation process, which is \nintended to lead to elections and the restoration of \nconstitutional order. That was an important \nbreakthrough in the process, which Angola welcomes. \n Guinea-Bissau, our brotherly country and partner \nin the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, \nhas been the subject of special attention by Angola. As \npart of the CPLP, Angola and other member States \nhave striven to establish a strategic partnership with \nthe Economic Community of West African States under \nthe coordination of the United Nations, aiming to bring \npolitical stability to the country so that it can carry out \nmajor structural reforms, in particular the reform of the \ndefence and security sectors. We welcome the positive \ndevelopments that the country is now experiencing and \nwe encourage the authorities of Guinea-Bissau to \nvigorously pursue the process of stabilization. \n The drought in the Horn of Africa is a cause of \ndeepest concern for my country and the entire \ninternational community. The consequences of drought \nin Somalia are felt even more profoundly due to the \nprevalence of armed conflict, which compounds the \nhumanitarian crisis, shocks the world\u2019s conscience and \ncalls for a redoubled effort by the international \ncommunity. Angola has joined the international \nhumanitarian assistance efforts under way, as well as \nthe search for political solutions to end the armed \nconflict and open new prospects for a better future for \nthe Somali people. \n With regard to the situation in Libya, the Angolan \nGovernment hopes that the Libyan people can find \nstability in the very near term. That can only be \nachieved through the free exercise of their democratic \nrights. In that regard, Angola urges the National \nTransitional Council to promote genuine national \nreconciliation and to form an inclusive Government, as \nthose are prerequisites for ensuring that Libya can \nregain its rightful place in the African and international \narenas. However, we must make use of lessons learned \nwith a view to achieving more effective cooperation \nbetween external partners and the African Union in \nseeking joint solutions based on international law and \nmutual respect. \n Angola remains concerned about the limited \nprogress in addressing the problem of Western Sahara, \nwhich remains an important issue on the international \nagenda. We call on the warring parties to resume \nnegotiations under the auspices of the United Nations \nand the African Union, so that the people of Western \nSahara can exercise their right to self-determination. \n The situation in the Middle East, particularly in \nthe Palestinian territories, is one of the most serious \nproblems facing the international community. Angola \nis witnessing with great concern the escalation of the \nconflict and the lack of progress towards a solution of \nthe Palestinian question. In line with the general \nposition of the international community regarding the \nconflict, my country advocates the establishment of an \nindependent Palestinian State, living side by side with \nthe State of Israel, in peace and security, within secure \ninternationally recognized borders. \n As in previous sessions, the sixty-sixth session of \nGeneral Assembly will address the embargo imposed \non Cuba, which violates the rules of international free \ntrade. In spite of the timid steps taken towards \nnormalizing the situation, Angola reiterates its position \nof principle by reaffirming the need to end the embargo \nagainst Cuba. \n \n \n13 11-51398 \n \n Angola has been making its contribution to \nfinding solutions to the most pressing problems. Within \nthe broader international community, we have sought \nto cooperate with all countries based on mutual respect \nand interests, upholding the highest ideals of peace and \ncooperation for development. We will continue on this \npath, firmly believing that the defence and promotion \nof these principles contribute to the development and \nadvancement of all peoples."

        "file_text": "At this general debate of the sixty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly, I convey to the \nAssembly a Christian, socialist greeting of solidarity \nfrom the people of Nicaragua and Comrade President \nCommander Daniel Ortega Saavedra. We trust that our \nwork will contribute to strengthening the Organization \nthrough an appropriate focus on its purposes, principles \nand possible contributions so that we can successfully \ndeal with the challenges before us as a community of \nStates, peoples and nations. \n One year ago, during our discussions at the sixty-\nfifth session of the General Assembly, we extensively \naddressed the serious and multifaceted international \ncrisis experienced by humankind. At that time we \ncalled it an apocalyptical crisis. One year later, the \nevolution of world events has confirmed our \nprofoundest fears that our civilization is now at a \ncritical stage and that peace between States and \npeoples is dangerously at risk. \n Expectations that the international economic and \nfinancial situation would improve have dissipated \nbefore the relentless reality of a profound crisis; its \ngravest effects still continue to affect deeply our \npeoples. The international financial system, which is \ncontrolled by speculators, again plunged into a tailspin. \nThe measures taken have had a temporary, non-lasting \neffect owing to the ever increasing greed of bankers. \nWe are now witnessing the effects of the United States \ninternal debt problem, which has generated great losses \nin most exchange markets. \n At present, as before, we affirm that we reject the \nlanguage of war between peoples and we reject war as \na means to resolve conflicts between States. In the light \nof the events in the brotherly Arab socialist popular \nrepublic of Libya, we reiterate our declaration of \nprinciple and express our solidarity with the brotherly \nLibyan people. \n The blunt and shameful manipulation of Security \nCouncil resolution 1973 (2011) regarding Libya \u2014 the \nillegal war being carried out by NATO members \u2014 is \nthe most recent example of the pathological need of \nparticular States to attempt to subordinate the peoples \nof the world at any cost. It is the most recent example \nof attacks against the sovereignty of a State Member of \nthe United Nations in violation of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. \n Nicaragua expresses its firmest rejection of the \nuse of the misnamed responsibility to protect in order \nto intervene in our countries, bomb civilians and \n  \n \n11-51398 4 \n \nchange free and sovereign governments. We cannot \nallow the imposition of this new model of imperialist \naggression nor the continued aggression against our \npeoples. Interference and intervention will not resolve \ncrises; only dialogue and negotiation among brothers \nand sisters will resolve political crises among peoples. \n The unacceptable policy of double standards has \nbecome a constant of those Powers, which clearly \naspire to hegemony. Where are those countries, the \nsupposed defenders of oppressed peoples, the self-\nproclaimed civilian protection apostles, when an \nattempt is being made to recognize the inalienable \nrights of the Palestinian people, their right to live in \npeace, their right to a sovereign State enjoying full \nrecognition as a State Member of the United Nations? \nThis is clearly an instance of double morals, double \nstandards. After six decades of conflict, the Palestinian \npeople are now to be denied their right to a State, while \na mere 10 days ago, with unheard of haste and, I must \nnote, a certain irony, the General Assembly recognized \na transitional council that has not yet formed a \nGovernment. \n We reject the logic of denying the very existence \nof a Palestinian State. From the moment of triumph of \nour revolution in 1979 \u2014 the Sandinista revolution \u2014 \nNicaragua has been a proud witness to the noble \nstruggle of the Palestinian people and their substantial \nconcessions aimed at achieving peace. \n Before the General Assembly, Nicaragua ratifies \nits recognition of the Palestinian State within its 1967 \nborders with East Jerusalem as its capital. We call, here \nand now, for the proclamation of Palestine as the \n194th State Member of the United Nations. \nRecognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian \npeople can only serve to promote Middle East peace \nand stability. At present, more than ever, such \nrecognition must become a reality. Clearly, Palestine\u2019s \nright is linked to the existence of the State of Israel, a \nState we recognize in juridical and political terms. May \nboth States exist, so that both peoples may live in \npeace and work for their well-being and development: \nThat is the universal appeal. \n Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly for \nmore than two decades have demanded an end to the \nUnited States of America\u2019s economic embargo against \nCuba. They must be fully implemented. Despite \nexpectations, the facts confirm that nothing has \nchanged. Sanctions against Cuba remain intact and are \nrigorously implemented. That criminal blockade \nviolates international law; it is contrary to the purposes \nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations and \nconstitutes a crime against a sovereign State\u2019s right to \npeace, development and security. In its essence and its \nobjectives, it is an act of unilateral aggression and a \npermanent threat to a country\u2019s stability. \n Despite that criminal blockade, Cuba continues \ndaily to strengthen its solidarity and fraternal relations \nwith all peoples of the world. Cuba\u2019s armies of white \ncoats and educators are ever more numerous in \ndemonstrating their country\u2019s solidarity. We also echo \nthe call for an end to the injustice against the five \nCuban heroes who have been unjustly imprisoned for \n13 years as of this past 12 September, for having \nalerted their people to the activities of terrorist \norganizations against Cuba. \n As unlikely as it may seem, the process of \ndecolonization has not ended, and there remain entire \npeoples who have been denied their right to \nindependence and self determination. We welcome and \nmaintain our solidarity with the peoples of Puerto Rico, \nthe Western Sahara and the struggle of the Frente \nPolisario and with Argentina with regard to the \noccupation of the Malvinas Islands. \n Observations made in the Assembly in 2010 \nregarding the need to achieve a balance between \nhuman beings and Mother Earth remain relevant; they \nhave even led us to conclude that, far from \ndiminishing, pressures on the planet have increased; \nthreats have escalated and real and potential dangers \nhave multiplied. \n Among those, the Fukushima disaster in Japan \nhad the virtue of bringing into view the chilling global \nrisk of radiation. The Japanese crisis has rightly been \ndescribed as a nuclear war without war. Its present and \nfuture repercussions, which have not yet been fully \nestablished, are considered by recognized scientists to \nbe more serious than those of the Chernobyl disaster. \n While expressing our solidarity with the \nGovernment and the heroic people of Japan \u2014 the \nvictims of the earthquake that levelled their territory \nand those affected by the Fukushima accident \u2014 we \nvehemently call on States with nuclear reactor \ninstallations to take all measures to avoid similar \naccidents that would gravely endanger people\u2019s health \nand would harm the environment. \n \n \n5 11-51398 \n \n The upcoming Durban Climate Change \nConference and the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment will provide renewed opportunities \u2014 \nwhich we must not allow ourselves to squander \u2014 to \ntruly break with destructive logic and redirect \nhumankind towards development that is in harmony \nwith Mother Earth and respectful of the lives of the 7 \nbillion human beings now populating the planet. \n We all know that we have been incapable of \nachieving an accord on climate change. Although the \nsixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nestablished a Green Fund and called for the \nmobilization of financing for developing countries, that \naccord is far from addressing the serious damage being \ndone to the environment and Mother Earth or the \nhistorical responsibility of the developed countries, \nwhich are bent on dealing a final blow to the Kyoto \nProtocol so as to continue their uncontrolled emissions \nof greenhouse effect gases. \n In Rio and in Durban we will be called upon to \nrenew our political will and adopt genuine, concrete \ncommitments based on previous progress and \ncommitments. The issue is of transcendental \nimportance for our planet and for human beings. \nDevelopment must not sacrifice life. We recall that the \nUniversal Declaration on the Common Well-Being of \nMother Earth and of humankind is an essential guide \nfor our debates and actions. \n Looking at other issues, Nicaragua salutes the \ninternational community\u2019s invitation to Taiwan to \nparticipate in the assemblies of United Nations \nspecialized agencies directly related to the well-being \nof the 23 million Taiwanese. We urge other \ninternational forums to adopt similar positions. \n The global economic and financial crisis has \ncompounded the already serious food crisis, primarily \nin impoverished countries. We know that this crisis \nalso has structural causes in the present capitalist \ndevelopment model \u2014 a model that discourages \ninternal production and impedes technology transfer to \nthe agricultural sector of impoverished countries, a \nmodel without available credit or technical training for \nsmall and medium producers, which results in \nproduction difficulties. \n Climate change has become an additional major \nfactor in the deepening of the food crisis. The trend \ntowards higher oil prices at the international level has \ncaused some countries with an agricultural base to \nbegin producing biofuel. That phenomenon has \nsignificantly changed food supply and demand and has \nreinforced the trend toward higher prices. \n From the ethical point of view, as well as \npolitical, economic and social, it is essential to take \nimmediate concerted action to avoid the continuing \nincrease in the number of hungry people and to \ndevelop sustainable policies for guaranteeing food \nsecurity worldwide. \n We renew our commitment to the cause of \ngeneral and complete disarmament. It is imperative \nthat we establish peace on Earth and provide the \n7 billion human beings who inhabit it, and Mother \nEarth itself, with the opportunity to survive the \ndestructive tendencies promoted by the dominant \neconomic model, so that humankind may develop in an \nenvironment conducive to manifesting our enormous \nspiritual and material capacities. No other way will \nenable us to achieve a better future. \n It is therefore unjustifiable and unacceptable that \nthe present world continues to spend more on the \ndevelopment and testing of all types of weapons and \nless on protecting the life and development of human \nbeings. While millions of persons suffer the effects of \nthe economic and financial crisis, global military \nexpenditures have skyrocketed. Over the past 10 years, \nthose expenditures have increased by 50 per cent, to \n$1.5 trillion today. More than 8 million small arms and \nlight weapons and more than 16 billion munitions are \nproduced every year, the equivalent to more than \n2.5 munitions for every single person on the planet. \nThat arms proliferation causes irreparable direct and \nindirect harm to peoples and their economies. \n We can end that proliferation if we decide to. It is \nnot true that the arms sector is vitally important to the \nworld economy. In fact, despite what the producers of \nsmall arms and light weapons would have us believe, \ntheir trade and the trade in munitions and components \nrepresent less than 0.01 per cent of the world\u2019s \nindustrial transactions. \n We are firmly convinced that because the Korean \npeninsula remains a focal point of international \ntension, any solution must take place through goodwill \nand sincere dialogue between the parties in order to \nmaintain peace and stability. \n  \n \n11-51398 6 \n \n The factors called new threats to security have \nbecome an outright scourge for most of our countries. \nDrug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal arms \ntrafficking, and the trafficking of immigrants, among \nothers, constitute ethical, political and economic \nchallenges for Central America, which is stigmatized \ntoday in some international reports as one of the most \nviolent regions on Earth. That stigmatization is \ndeliberate and carries serious consequences for our \ncountries. It transforms us into protagonists of the \nproblem rather than the victims we truly are, victims of \nthe lucrative businesses that constitute those new \nthreats. Through transnational networks they utilize our \nterritories as a bridge from South to North and from \nNorth to South, in a dance of millionaires as thousands \nof people are assassinated along illegal routes and \nporous borders. \n The International Conference of Support for the \nCentral American Security Strategy, held in Guatemala \nlast June, exposed the seriousness of a situation that \nexists not only in our region, but in all of the countries \nof the world. That is why the principle of shared but \ndifferentiated and proportional responsibility must \nguide mutual commitments. It is urgent that we move \nin the right direction before it is too late for us all. \n Nicaragua is going through a time of change \naimed at reversing the negative effects of 16 long years \nunder neoliberal Governments. We are recovering \nvalues, restoring rights, strengthening capacities and \nconstructing a new model based on replacing the \nneoliberal model of untrammeled capitalism with one \nbased on Christian, socialist and solidarity principles. \nWe are articulating popular democracy through the \nnational human development plan. Together these \nconstitute the backbone of a new phase of the \nSandinista revolution. \n These achievements are due in large part to \nNicaragua\u2019s integration into the Bolivarian Alliance for \nthe Peoples of Our Americas, an initiative stemming \nfrom the genius of Fidel Castro, the Commander in \nChief of the Cuban revolution, and of Commander-\nPresident Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas. This brotherhood, \nunique in today\u2019s world, enables solidarity, \ncomplementarity and fair trade between our peoples \nand advances the historical cultural unity of our \npeoples. \n At the same time, our national human \ndevelopment plan is aimed specifically at promoting \nthe country\u2019s economic and social health by adding \njobs and reducing poverty and inequality, on a basis of \nsovereignty, security and integration. The restoration of \nthe human and constitutional right of all Nicaraguans \nto free education is reflected in the fact that, in a \ncountry with a total population of 6.5 million, \n1,821,682 students are now enrolled in schools. This \nyear we are launching the battle for universal primary \neducation, aiming at universal sixth grade education by \n2012. The goal is to achieve universal enrolment in the \nthird year of secondary school by 2015. \n The restoration of the human and constitutional \nright of the Nicaraguan people to free health care \nmeans providing better access to, and improving the \nquality of, health services, reducing maternal and \ninfant mortality, paying more attention to the \ndevelopment of young people, expanding community \nfamily health services, and the first large-scale \nregistering of people with disabilities. Our Programa \nAmor is designed for boys and girls under six years old \nand for street children and adolescents, and those who \nwork during school terms, in order to restore to them \ntheir fundamental rights. \n In structural areas, we are making progress in \ntransforming the energy matrix so that by 2017, 90 per \ncent of energy will be from renewable sources and \n10 per cent from fossil fuels, radically inverting the \npyramid we inherited in 2006. We are enjoying \nmacroeconomic stability, with gross national product \ngrowth projected at 4 per cent or more. Our \nimprovement policies have increased direct foreign \ninvestment in our country\u2019s strategic sectors. We have \nhad outstanding successes in confronting drug \ntrafficking and transnational organized crime. \nNicaragua is now recognized as one of the safest \ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the \nsafest in Central America. We have had indisputable \nsuccesses in reducing poverty and inequality, as has \nbeen recognized by international financial institutions. \n We are fervent supporters of the integration and \nunity of Central America, Latin America and the \nCaribbean. Within the framework of the Bolivarian \nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America, we are \nsecuring our model through complementarity, \ninvestments, fair trade and solidarity.  \n With our neighbours and brothers in Honduras \nand El Salvador, we are working together for the \nsustainable development of the Gulf of Fonseca. \n \n \n7 11-51398 \n \nComrade President Daniel Ortega Saavedra has also \nmade several approaches to the Government and \npeople of our neighbour to the south, Costa Rica, \nconcerning the possibility of joint development of our \ncommon border, particularly in terms of protecting and \nrestoring the environment and working on sustainable \neconomic and social development for the benefit of \nboth our peoples. Throughout this process, young \npeople and women have been at the forefront of the \ndirect democracy model that is the essence and \ncontinuity of the Sandinista revolution. \n Nicaragua can demonstrate the profound, \nconcrete and verifiable economic, social, political, \nlegislative and cultural achievements our people are \nundergoing. In the context of the serious crises that so \nmany countries, developed and developing, are going \nthrough, our Christian, socialist, solidarity model is an \ninspiration for an ever better future.  \n We are aware of our difficulties and limitations. \nWe know that the weight of the historical structure that \nwe inherited is still a liability that we must cast off in \nour national development process. The burdens of \npoverty and underdevelopment require sound policies \nand sustained effort and political and governing \nsystems that have the necessary commitment to our \npeople\u2019s aspirations. I can assure the Assembly that \nthrough our Government of national reconciliation and \nunity we will achieve that and more. \n As we have said before, it is not easy for \ndeveloping countries such as ours to deal with an issue \nof the breadth and depth of the global economic and \nfinancial crisis. We have yet to recover from the harsh \neffects of the last wave, while the new threat of another \nand greater crisis is bearing down on us. According to \nthe International Monetary Fund, Central America\u2019s \nresponse to the previous world economic and financial \ncrisis was in large part successful. We were able to deal \nwith the situation successfully \u2014 success with costs \nthat in Nicaragua\u2019s case were not passed on to the \npoorest, because the measures we adopted were based \non the interests of our country as a whole. \n As we consider international developments, we \nmust also turn our attention to our own Organization. \nGlobal democratization must be accompanied by \ndemocratization of the United Nations without further \ndelay.  \n In his book La reinvenci\u00f3n de la ONU: una \npropuesta, our comrade and friend, the former \nPresident of the Assembly, General Father Miguel \nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann \u2014 who is with us here \u2014 states \nthat it is urgent that we give true meaning to \ndemocracy and independence in the United Nations, so \nthat the opinions of all can be heard and so that those \nopinions really count in the decision-making process, \nwith no one being excluded. \n This proposal, adopted by our national \nreconciliation and unity Government, consists of \nproposals on the United Nations charter, the statute of \nthe International Court of Justice and the statute for the \nInternational Tribunal for Climate Justice and \nEnvironmental Protection, as well as a proposal on a \ndraft universal declaration on the common good of \nmother earth and humankind. \n Reinvention and re-grounding are key concepts \nthat will pave the way for an international system \nbased on genuine multilateralism that is in harmony \nwith the changes the world has undergone during the \npast few decades. We must restore a true political \ndimension to international law and to the rights of \npeople. \n Developed societies are sinking into the despair \ncaused by unemployment, the lack of social security, \nfinancial insolvency, the implosion of established \nlabour rights and an uncertain future. Global Powers \nare waging wars of aggression with no moral or \npolitical base, causing material destruction and \nenormous human suffering. Economic and financial \nrecovery are nowhere in sight; on the contrary, \nspecialists foresee a recession even more serious than \nthe one we have recently experienced. \n Where do we find the solution we so urgently \nneed? Where do we regain hope in the possibility of a \ndifferent present and future world, in which there is \npeace between States and nations? In which \ndevelopment efforts and impressive scientific and \ntechnological advances are equitably shared? In which, \nas the Greek sophist Protagoras put it, man is the \nmeasure of all things? \n According to many prominent thinkers on the \nglobal reality, the final crisis of the capitalist \ndevelopment model has arrived. There is no time for \nreforms. As Leonardo Boff has said,  \n \u201cWe need to find another way of thinking, one \nbased on principles and values that can sustain a \nnew test of civilization. If not, we will have to \n  \n \n11-51398 8 \n \naccept a path that leads straight to the edge of the \nprecipice. Dinosaurs already took that path.\u201d  \n Nicaragua is proceeding on the belief that a better \nfuture is possible if only we are capable of steering in a \nnew direction, if we struggle for justice and peace, and \nif we commit ourselves to the development and \ndefence of the common good of the Earth and of \nhumankind."

        "file_text": "It is a distinct \nhonour and pleasure for me to address the General \nAssembly at the outset of its sixty-sixth session. This \nforum provides us with an unparalleled opportunity to \nstrengthen, through dialogue, our concerted efforts in \nthe quest for solutions to the mounting challenges that \nthe international community faces today. We, the \nleaders of the United Nations, are expected to offer \nguidance and find solutions. \n I am convinced that, given the extensive \ndiplomatic experience of the President of the \nAssembly, and under his able leadership, we will be \nable to make this session a successful one. I wish him \nevery success in his demanding duties and assure him \nof my delegation\u2019s full support and assistance. I also \nwish to express my delegation\u2019s appreciation and \ngratitude for the exquisite work of his predecessor, \nMr. Joseph Deiss, who so skilfully guided our \nproceedings during the sixty-fifth session. \n Let me also join others in paying tribute to the \nremarkable work of the newly reappointed Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. We deeply \nvalue his eminent personal and diplomatic qualities and \nlook forward to working with him during his next \ntenure. \n Slovakia warmly welcomes the Republic of South \nSudan as a new member of the United Nations family. \nWe wish South Sudan every success and, above all, \npeace, security and prosperity for its people. \n Her Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of \nthe Federative Republic of Brazil, opened her speech \nwith these words:  \n  \u201cFor the very first time in the history of the \nUnited Nations, a female voice is opening the \ngeneral debate. It is the voice of democracy and \nequality.\u201d ()  \nPresident Rousseff expressed in two words the main \nchallenge for the coming years: courage and sincerity. \nThis challenge is accurate at a time of economic and \ndebt crisis. We have to say openly that we still do not \nhave adequate solutions. We are facing common risks \nin economy, governance and politics. \n Citizens all over the world expect leadership and \na mutual synergy of economy and politics. The \nmajority of the world\u2019s population expects economic \ngrowth, prosperity and a better quality of life. Those \nliving in poverty \u2014 the millions of people without \njobs, without water and without food \u2014 expect real \nanswers, quick action and results from political \nleaders. \n What can such a small country as Slovakia do to \naddress these challenges? First, it has to do its own \nhomework in stabilizing the economy. That means \nensuring our pension system\u2019s sustainability through \ndeep reforms, and enacting a fiscal responsibility law \nthat will ensure that fiscal policy is responsible to \nfuture generations and counter-cyclical. It means \nlabour market reforms that support the creation of the \nnew jobs the country badly needs, especially for some \nof its vulnerable groups. It means lowering the \nadministrative burden and decreasing barriers to \nentrepreneurship, improving the predictability of the \nlegal environment, and ensuring a wider use of \ne-Government services. Of course, it means measures \nto tackle corruption and to increase transparency, for \nexample through a legal act ensuring that any contract \nconcerning the use of public funds is valid only if \npublished on the internet. \n  \n \n11-51360 8 \n \n The Slovak Republic is a small country, but it is a \npart of the eurozone, which is in deep economic \ntrouble. Courage and sincerity are most needed most \nthese days in Europe. The financial crisis and its \nnegative influence upon the entire European banking \nsector have clearly shown that the eurozone was not \nprepared for a crisis. The chaos in addressing these \nissues only deepened the general distrust and worsened \nthe subsequent economic recession. The majority of \nEuropean Union countries did not use the good \neconomic times to consolidate their budgets. Therefore, \nin many cases, the consequences of the recession \nshifted public debt into dangerous territory. \n We need courage in the eurozone to return to the \nold principles that established the European Union, \nwhich are necessary for successful international \ncooperation and integration. We need stricter European \nand national fiscal rules. We need to institute default \ncontrols, and we need new rules for the careful \nmanagement of the financial sector. \n We need sincerity. We have to be honest with our \ncitizens, because we have to be very careful that the \nresponse to forcing technical solutions to the debt \ncrisis is not the escalation of nationalism and populism. \nThere is a chance that we will save the eurozone \neconomically, but at the same time we must minimize \nthe risk of losing the project of European integration \npolitically and devaluing it in the eyes of our voters. \n It is not just Europe; every region in the world is \nstruggling today with serious economic difficulties. We \nlive in a global, interdependent reality in which we \ncannot afford to ignore anybody\u2019s problems. In this \nregard, we believe that, as a member of the Economic \nand Social Council, that body has the capacity to \ncontribute more significantly to our joint efforts. If it is \nto do that, we feel that it is urgent to adjust its mandate \nand enhance its ability to react more swiftly to the \neconomic and social needs of the world. \n In times of dire financial restrictions in our own \nnational budgets, we, as the United Nations, also need \nto learn to do more with fewer resources. We welcome \nevery effort that the Secretary-General is making to \nutilize the available resources with maximum \neffectiveness and efficiency. \n Peace and security are ever harder to maintain in \nthese harsh crisis times. One of Slovakia\u2019s priorities in \nthe fight against international terrorism remains the \nendeavour to move forward the negotiations on the \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \nWith regard to the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, Slovakia will continue its \nimplementation through concrete projects, as we have \nby co-organizing a special event on implementing the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in \nCentral Asia, held in Bratislava in December 2010. \nRespect for international law, human rights and the rule \nof law should be an integral part of the fight against \ninternational terrorism. \n Peacekeeping missions are among the most \nvisible and successful activities of the United Nations \nand the true expression of the commitment to \nmaintaining peace and security around the globe. The \nSlovak Republic has been an active contributor to the \nUnited Nations forces in Cyprus since 2001, and is \ninvolved in the Middle East. In recent decades, we \nhave witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions. They have \nbecome increasingly in-demand, their mandates are \nwidening and their management is becoming more \ncomplex. Slovakia therefore supports every measure \naimed at increasing their effectiveness and efficiency \ngiven our truly constrained budgets. \n Peace is not merely the absence of war. Peace \nmeans safety in all areas of people\u2019s lives, economic \nprosperity, social stability, respect for human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, access to health care and \neducation, protection of the environment, and access to \nwater and food. There is no chance of lasting peace \nwithout sustainable development. That is an area in \nwhich we must still do a great deal of work and make \nconcerted efforts. Aid from Slovakia \u2014 a small \ncountry \u2014 has since 2003 been aimed at the most \ntroubled regions of the world. Recently, Slovakia has \nbeen providing development and humanitarian aid in \nthe context of 41 projects to help starving children in \nKenya, deliver food and water in Ethiopia; provide \nhumanitarian help in South Sudan; assist Pakistan \nfollowing the terrible floods there; help refugees, from \nLibya to Tunisia; and also to provide technical \nassistance for countries in the western Balkans and in \nthe Middle East. Slovakia is also helping to secure the \ndemocratization process in Afghanistan through 13 \nnew projects. \n We need to focus on eliminating the primary \ncauses of conflicts, not just deal hastily with their \ngrave consequences, which, sadly, often occur only \nafter too many lives have been destroyed. No effort \n \n \n9 11-51360 \n \nshould be spared in exploring all political and \ndiplomatic options to stop conflicts at their roots. \nMediation has proved to yield tangible results. I want \nto stress the important role of women in these \nprocesses, as it is often underestimated.  \n Slovakia is a firm supporter of effective \nmultilateralism, with the United Nations playing a \ncentral role. Concentrated efforts help create just and \nlasting solutions. \n This will be yet another challenging session for \nall of us. It calls for a renewed, shared commitment to \nthe fundamental principles and purposes of the United \nNations Charter. We cannot afford to lose the ability to \nunderstand one another\u2019s needs because of our own \ndomestic problems. In these hard times, I wish all of us \nenough strength to find necessary, mutually \nadvantageous solutions."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, \nallow me, on behalf of the Government and people of \nPapua New Guinea, to offer our warmest \ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We \npledge support for your statement highlighting the \nsuccess of global endeavours that are founded on the \nprinciples of partnership, justice and responsibility. I \nalso thank your predecessor, Mr. Joseph Diess, for his \ninvaluable contributions to the United Nations, and I \nwish him well.  \n I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, \nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his \nreappointment for a second term, and to thank him for \nattending our recent annual Pacific Islands Leaders \nMeeting in Auckland, New Zealand. His attendance at \nour regional meeting was the first by a United Nations \nSecretary-General and is testament to the strengthening \nties between the United Nations and the Pacific region. \nWe particularly note his heartfelt comments when \ndescribing his experiences on witnessing the adverse \neffects of climate change on low-lying atolls in the \nRepublic of Kiribati and the various other development \nchallenges faced by many small island States in our \nregion. \n Allow me, like other speakers, to take this \nopportunity to welcome our newest member of the \nUnited Nations family \u2014 the Republic of South Sudan. \n Papua New Guinea continues to benefit from a \nstrong United Nations presence through its delivery of \nvarious development programmes. Papua New Guinea \nwelcomed and formalized the \u201cOne United Nations \nInitiative: delivering as one\u201d concept in 2006. That has \n  \n \n11-51372 4 \n \nunified all the efforts of the various United Nations \nagencies under one budgetary framework, monitoring \nand evaluation process. \n The concept will enable a more effective and \nefficient way for the United Nations to deliver on its \nmandate, particularly the new country programme for \nPapua New Guinea, to be rolled out at the beginning of \nJanuary 2012. It will target the areas of governance, \nsocial justice, health, education, gender, the \nenvironment, climate change and disaster management.  \n That new country programme is part of our \noverall efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). Since the inaugural MDG report was \npublished in 2004, Papua New Guinea has produced \ntwo MDG progress reports. The first, in 2009, was a \nsummary report and the second, in 2010, a \ncomprehensive report. They showed that we have been \nable to achieve some of the national MDG targets, \nespecially on poverty reduction and child mortality. \n In terms of universal primary education, Papua \nNew Guinea is progressing well, with the enrolment of \nchildren in grades one to six increasing significantly \u2014 \nby 53 per cent. That is a marked improvement and will \nincrease the literacy rate in the long term. Our \nGovernment recently announced a policy of free \neducation from the elementary level to year 10 and \nsubsidized education from grade 11 to university, \ncommencing 2012. \n We are also revamping our national health system \nto improve immunization programmes, to provide a \nclean and safer water supply, to centralize the purchase \nand supply of medical drugs, and to reduce maternal \nand child mortality and the incidence of malaria, \nHIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. The \nrecent important summit on non-communicable \ndiseases, attended by our Minister for Health, \nreiterated our equal responsibility for our own, our \nfamilies\u2019 and our communities\u2019 health and well-being. \n Our Government remains committed to achieving \nthe MDGs, and we are now scaling up progress in all \nrelevant sectors. Our new Development Strategic Plan \n2010-2030 and Medium Term Development Plan aim \nto develop and foster key enabling environments, \nwhich will raise Papua New Guinea to a middle-\nincome country and improve its Human Development \nIndex ranking. \n We call on all our development partners to \ncomplement our efforts to achieve the MDG targets in \nline with our national development plans and policies. I \nbelieve other developing countries will support our \ncall. \n We are also investing heavily in the rehabilitation \nof our major transport infrastructure, including roads, \nairports and seaports. Aside from that, we are also \nrolling out rural communication systems and rural \nelectrification. As we are all aware, improved \ninfrastructure will enable effective service delivery. \n Women play critical roles in all facets of our \ndevelopment. Our Government is conscious of the need \nto have more women participate actively in the affairs \nof state and in the economic life of our country. I am \npleased to report that we have recently passed the first \nvote on a parliamentary bill that will provide for \n22 seats reserved for women to contest in the coming \nelections in 2012. That provision does not stop them \nfrom contesting any of the existing seats. \n We also appreciate the push by multilateral \npartners like the Asian Development Bank and the \nWorld Bank for gender equality. In the same breath, \nhowever, we urge them to support our financial \ninstitutions by specifically allocating funds without \nrisk to be lent to women entrepreneurs to develop \nbusiness opportunities. \n We note the recently adopted San Francisco \nDeclaration by the countries member of the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) last week, \nunder the leadership of the United States of America. \nThat is a major step forward in supporting women in \nbusiness and is a powerful tool for women of the APEC \nmember countries. We will encourage our women in \nPapua New Guinea to take advantage of the \nopportunities created by that Declaration. \n There remain many other global challenges that \ncontinue to affect the development aspirations of many \nof our countries. One is nuclear non-proliferation. The \nPacific remains a nuclear-weapons-free zone. We call \nupon other Member States who are not yet signatories \nto sign and ratify the Rarotonga Treaty. \n The illegal use, abuse and the dangerous \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons continue \nto hamper the development aspirations of many \ndeveloping countries. We therefore call upon the \ninternational community to deal seriously with \n \n \n5 11-51372 \n \noutstanding issues such as the illegal supply of and \ntrade in small arms. Our Government will do all it can \nto accelerate the implementation of the \nrecommendations in our own Gun Summit Report. \n On transnational crime, Papua New Guinea \nremains committed to working closely with other \nGovernments and relevant international law \nenforcement agencies to curb drug trafficking, human \ntrafficking and money-laundering. \n As one of the top five remaining rainforest \nnations, we are committed to addressing the many \nchallenges of climate change, biodiversity and \nsustainable development of our forests. We continue to \nmaintain dialogue with all stakeholders, being mindful \nthat issues confronting many nations on climate change \nare very complex. \n In the matter of United Nations reform, we \nsupport and encourage the reform of the United \nNations, its agencies and its Secretariat, to make them \nmore responsive to and active in responding to global, \nregional and national challenges. We reiterate our call \nfor an expansion of membership in the permanent and \nnon-permanent categories of the Security Council, \nwhich must take into account the geopolitical realities \nof today\u2019s world. \n In terms of our contribution to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, I am pleased to \nannounce the deployment of our uniformed personnel \nas military observers. That is history in the making for \nour country, and we thank the United Nations for \ngiving us the opportunity for our security personnel to \nparticipate in international peacekeeping duties. \n On regional issues, tuna is an important source of \nfood and is, along with tourism, an economic resource \nfor the Pacific island States. Papua New Guinea and \ncountries that are parties to the Nauru Agreement are \ndetermined to process tuna onshore to add value and \ncreate employment for our people. We encourage \ninvestors to invest in onshore activities. \n At the Pacific regional level, we are conscious of \nour obligation to conserve fisheries through sustainable \nfishing. The parties to the Nauru Agreement have \nintroduced the Vessel Day Scheme to limit the total \ncatch for conservation purposes. In addition, Papua \nNew Guinea continues to make funds available to the \nSouth Pacific community to tag tuna species so that we \nare can quantify and assess the tuna stocks for the \nfuture. \n Over the past nine years, Papua New Guinea has \ncontinued to experience unprecedented economic \ngrowth levels of 6 to 8 per cent per annum. That has \nbeen largely attributable to significant increases in \nforeign investments in our mineral and hydrocarbon \nsectors and to the high prices of our agricultural \ncommodities. Those economic growth levels have \npositioned Papua New Guinea to become a significant \ndevelopment partner within our region. \n Papua New Guinea greatly values the objectives \nand principles of the United Nations Charter. We \nreaffirm our support for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, the development of \nfriendly relations among nations and working together \ntowards the achievement of the aspirations of all of our \npeoples."

        "file_text": "I bring warm greetings \nto all from the Government and people of Fiji. May I \ntake this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on \nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-sixth session and pay tribute to his \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss. \n This year, it was my honour to open new missions \nin Indonesia and South Africa. The Fiji High \nCommission in Pretoria is our first diplomatic mission \non the continent of Africa, and we see it as a gateway \nto that great continent. Our new embassy in Jakarta is \nintended to strengthen our warm, fraternal relations \nwith Indonesia. In the same spirit, I journey next week \nto Brazil to open Fiji\u2019s first embassy on the South \nAmerican continent.  \n In May this year Fiji had the privilege of being \nadmitted to membership of the Non-Aligned \nMovement. We have pledged to play our full part in the \nMovement\u2019s activities, particularly in the area of \nSouth-South cooperation and sustainable development. \nThese positive developments complement the Fijian \nGovernment\u2019s Look North Policy and our intention to \nexpand relations with non-traditional partners. We \nbelieve that such an expansion of outlook is essential \nto our national development and our full exercise of \nFiji\u2019s global rights and responsibilities. Here at the \nUnited Nations, we are active members of the Asia-\nPacific Group and, along with our fellow Pacific small \nisland developing States, we greatly appreciate the \nsupport given to us by members of that regional group. \n Fiji\u2019s guiding document, the People\u2019s Charter for \nChange, Peace and Progress, has given our nation the \ntask of enhancing Fiji\u2019s international relations, both \nbilaterally and multilaterally. In pursuit of this task, \nsince the beginning of last year Fiji has formalized \ndiplomatic relations with 37 countries, bringing to a \ntotal of 114 the number of countries with which Fiji \nhas formal diplomatic relations. Fiji is firmly on the \n  \n \n11-51197 2 \n \npath of formalizing our diplomatic relations with all \nStates Members of the United Nations. \n Fiji remains steadfastly committed to the work of \nthe United Nations in safeguarding world peace, \nincluding all international counter-terrorism efforts. In \n2006, Fiji voted in favour of the preparation of a robust \narms trade treaty (resolution 61/89), and we commend \nall those who have shown commitment to preparing \nthat treaty for signature in 2012.  \n Fiji\u2019s commitment to the Charter of the United \nNations remains steadfast. Our tradition of service in \nthe Blue Helmets of United Nations peacekeeping \nbegan in 1978 in Lebanon with the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon, in which the Fijian battalion \nserved for 24 years. In 1982 when the multinational \nforce and observers were deployed as peacekeepers in \nSinai, a Fijian battalion was among them and has \nremained there to this day. In Iraq, the guard unit of the \nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) \nhas been manned by Fijians since 2004. With the \nplanned withdrawal of the United States forces from \nIraq this year, the United Nations has seen fit to \nincrease the size of its UNAMI guard unit and, after \ndue process, Fiji was selected to provide the extra \npersonnel. We thank the United Nations for the \nconfidence it has shown in our servicemen and \nservicewomen.  \n In addition, Fijian servicemen and servicewomen \nare currently stationed in peacekeeping missions in \nSouth Sudan, Abyei, Darfur, Liberia and Timor-Leste. I \npause here to profess my country\u2019s recognition and \nrespect for the selfless service given by United Nations \npeacekeepers in the troubled regions of our world, and \nto pay tribute to those of them who made the ultimate \nsacrifice. \n Fiji is currently the Chair of the Melanesian \nSpearhead Group (MSG), whose membership includes \nFiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and \nthe Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front of \nNew Caledonia. This year, the MSG was pleased to \nadmit Indonesia and Timor-Leste to observer status. \nFiji wishes to commend the work of our brother MSG \nmissions at the United Nations in bringing Melanesian \nconcerns to the attention of the United Nations Special \nPolitical and Decolonization Committee. Through its \nmembership of the Decolonization Committee, Fiji will \ncontinue to call for the Committee to conduct effective \nmonitoring and assessment of the progress of New \nCaledonia\u2019s Noum\u00e9a Accord. In this regard, we would \nwelcome the establishment of arrangements for closer \ncooperation and information-sharing between the \nUnited Nations Secretariat and the MSG secretariat. \nWe also express our gratitude to the Government of \nFrance for its cooperation and assistance to this end. \n The United Nations Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) continue to inspire our economic \ndevelopment efforts. In Fiji, we have concentrated our \nfocus on national infrastructure development under our \nroad map for democracy and sustainable socio-economic \ndevelopment. Under the road map, priority has been \ngiven to rural electrification expansion, access to clean \nwater and to national road development. This focus is \nwith a view to creating the bedrock required for \nsustainable economic growth.  \n Since the reform of Fiji\u2019s laws to bring them into \nline with the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination against Women and the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child, further progress \nhas been achieved. We are experiencing increased \nparticipation by women in local decision-making \nbodies, thereby empowering rural women, increasing \nthe enrolment of women and girls in tertiary education, \ngender mainstreaming within the Government system \nand increasing the provision of welfare assistance to \nthe marginalized, including single mothers.  \n The Domestic Violence Decree, which came into \neffect last year, is now being effectively implemented \nby the law enforcement agencies in conjunction with \ncivil society groups. Its regime of restraining orders is \nintended to deter perpetrators of family violence from \ninflicting further violence, while allowing families to \nremain together in peace. The Decree recognizes the \ndifficulty experienced by women and children in \ngaining access to the justice system because of family, \ncommunity, cultural and attitudinal barriers.  \n In order to address the MDG HIV/AIDS target, \nthe Fijian Government enacted a new law this year \nthat, among other things, safeguards the privacy and \nrights of persons infected or affected by HIV. The \nHIV/AIDS Decree is based on the United Nations \ninternational guidelines on HIV/AIDS and on the \nDeclaration of Commitment to a human rights-based \napproach to dealing with the epidemic. The Decree has \nbeen acknowledged as one of the most progressive HIV \nlaws in the world. Fiji participated in and was \nrepresented by our Head of State, His Excellency Ratu \n \n \n3 11-51197 \n \nEpeli Nailatikau, at the HIV/AIDS High-level Meeting \nthat was held in this Hall in August.  \n In addition to the HIV/AIDS Decree, Fiji this \nyear passed the Mental Health Decree, based on World \nHealth Organization guidelines on best practice for \nmental patients, and the Child Welfare Decree, which \ncreates a system that requires the mandatory reporting \nof child abuse by doctors, police officers and lawyers \nto the Ministry of Social Welfare. \n Fiji is determined to provide to all Fijians \nenlightened and progressive laws on health care, access \nto health services and justice. A large percentage of \nFiji\u2019s population is at risk of contracting a \nnon-communicable disease (NCDs), or lifestyle \ndisease, including cardiovascular or cancerous \ndiseases. We welcome the high-level commitment of \nthe international community to address this crisis and \nthe successful completion of the High-level Meeting on \nNCDs this week. The Fijian Government has taken key \nactions to address NCD issues, including being the first \ncountry to sign and ratify the Framework Convention \non Tobacco Control. It is also one of the first countries \nto pilot a salt-reduction programme. \n The economic reforms undertaken by the Fijian \nGovernment have produced positive mid-term results. \nLast month, we were heartened to learn that Fiji\u2019s \neconomic standing was assessed at a higher level by \nthe credit-rating agency Standard and Poor\u2019s. This \nimproved rating is also attributable to the strong \nsupport of all development partners, including the \nprivate sector, which have worked closely with the \nFijian Government. I wish to take this opportunity to \nthank them for their cooperation, assistance and \ncollaboration. \n As a small island developing State (SIDS) \nvulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, \nFiji has a strong desire to see positive and concrete \noutcomes achieved at the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in \nDurban later this year. We hold firm to the hope of a \nsuccessful outcome from the UNFCCC negotiations. \nHowever, the urgency of the situation for many small \nisland and low-lying coastal States, and the real threat \nposed by sea-level rise, prompted the Pacific SIDS to \ndraw the attention of the Security Council to the \nsecurity implications of climate change. Fiji hopes that \nthe presidential statement adopted by the Council in \nJuly (S/PRST/2011/15*) at the end of the open debate \non the security implications of climate change will \nenable the Council to look further into the plight of \nthose countries that are most at risk of losing their \nterritory to climate change. \n As the first signatory to the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea, Fiji has kept its \noceanic obligations at the core of its foreign policy. \nWith the increasing interest in seabed mining, and in \norder to avoid a race to the bottom by countries \nwishing to exploit the untapped mineral resources on \nthe ocean floor, it is imperative that the International \nSeabed Authority remain vigilant in safeguarding the \nenvironmental integrity of the world\u2019s seabeds. Fiji has \ninvested much time and many resources in the \nresponsible consideration of seabed mining, and thus \nwelcomes the Advisory Opinion of the Seabed \nDisputes Chamber on the responsibilities and \nobligations of States parties with regard to seabed \nmining. We also welcome the decision by the Council \nof the International Seabed Authority to approve the \napplication by Tonga and Nauru for the exploration of \npolymetallic nodules in the mid-east Pacific Ocean.  \n We see the Pacific small island developing States \nas legitimate participants in this oceanic resource. The \nPacific Ocean is the mainstay of our country\u2019s \nlivelihood, our food security and our economy. Fiji \nviews the blue economy as an essential element of the \ngreen economy. In this regard, we consider the 2012 \nRio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development to be critical to protecting \nthat economy. \n Since I last addressed the General Assembly (see \nA/65/PV.19), Fijians have benefited from the nation\u2019s \nStrategic Framework for Change. The Framework set \nin place the road map that will take Fiji to the holding \nof national elections by September 2014. Under the \nprovisions of the road map, from September next year \nuntil 2013 our nation must turn its attention to the \ndevelopment of a new constitution premised along the \nlaudable principles set out in the People\u2019s Charter for \nChange, Peace and Progress. The road map clearly \nstates that in the process the new Fijian constitution \nmust do away with racial categorization and \ndiscrimination so that for the first time in Fiji\u2019s history, \nFijians will go to elections in 2014 on the basis of \ncommon and equal suffrage. That will be real progress. \nIt will undo decades of undemocratic laws and policies \ninherited from our colonial past and entrenched in past \nConstitutions that have impeded our nation\u2019s progress. \n  \n \n11-51197 4 \n \nThis is a determined move to create a society based on \nsubstantive equality and justice and respect for the \ndignity of all Fijians.  \n As we enter this formative two-year period in \nFiji\u2019s history, we recognize that inclusiveness will be \nan essential part of the process in the formulation of \nthe new constitution. We also recognize our national \nresponsibility at all times to ensure that the nation\u2019s \noverall peace, well-being and sustainable economic \ndevelopment prevail over divisive factional interests. \nThe Fijian nation will prevail, and we have every \nconfidence that our beloved country has the \nhomegrown ability to pull itself up by its own \nbootstraps. In this respect, I am happy to inform this \ngathering that electronic registration of voters for the \nnational elections is scheduled to commence in January \nnext year. \n We trust that our trading and development \npartners, friends old and new, will give us the \nunderstanding, the space and the assistance we need to \nensure that true and sustainable democracy can take \nroot in Fiji. In this regard, we have taken great heart \nfrom recent assurances of support from many of our \nbilateral and multilateral friends, not least of which is \nthe United Nations. \n Once again, I offer my congratulations to the \nPresident on his election and my best wishes for a \nproductive sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on \nyour well-deserved election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. My delegation has \nfull confidence in you, and we assure you of our full \nsupport and cooperation. I also thank and congratulate \nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for \nvery ably steering the affairs of the sixty-fifth session. \nA lot has been achieved, which, I have no doubt, you \nwill consolidate and advance. \n Allow me also to take this opportunity to extend \nmy heartfelt congratulations to our illustrious Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, on his well-\ndeserved second mandate. His reappointment reaffirms \nthe trust that we have in him and in his leadership skills. \nIt is also recognition of his dedicated service to the \nUnited Nations and humankind as a whole. \n Once again, I congratulate and welcome the \nnewest member of the United Nations family, the \nRepublic of South Sudan, and assure them of \nTanzania\u2019s continued friendship and cooperation. \n This year the United Republic of Tanzania, which \nis a union between two sovereign States \u2014 the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Zanzibar and the Republic of \nTanganyika \u2014 will celebrate 50 years of the \nindependence of Tanganyika. We will also celebrate 50 \nyears of our membership in the United Nations. I stand \nbefore the Assembly today, 50 years later, to reiterate \nthat same faith in, and that same commitment to, the \nUnited Nations as expressed by the founders of our \ndear nation. I am proud that Tanzania has remained \nfaithful to the ideals of the United Nations, and is a \nproactive Member of this body. We promise to stay the \ncourse for the next 50 years and beyond. \n The people of Tanzania are happy to have had the \nopportunity to contribute to maintaining peace and \nsecurity in Africa and other parts of the world. We have \nalways believed that mediation, conflict prevention and \npacific settlement of disputes are the best means of \nresolving conflicts. As a result, Tanzania has been in \nthe forefront of mediation efforts to resolve conflicts in \nthe countries around us, in our region and elsewhere on \nthe continent. \n Our country also has been contributing troops, \npolice, corrections officers and civilian personnel to \nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions and through \nregional and sub-regional arrangements. We promise to \ncontinue to do so wherever and whenever asked. More \nimportant, we are humbled to have had the rare \nopportunity to pioneer the efforts, together with \nDenmark, that lead to the creation of the Peacebuilding \nCommission in 2006. \n We are also proud to have had, in the 50 years of \nour membership in the United Nations, the opportunity \nto contribute to the decolonization of Africa and other \nparts of the world. At independence, the founding \nfather of our nation, the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, \nsaid that the independence of our country was \nincomplete until all countries of Africa were free.  \n That guided Tanzania to strongly oppose all \nforms of colonialism, apartheid and racial \ndiscrimination on the African continent and elsewhere. \nIt also informed our resolve to help our brothers and \nsisters who were fighting for their independence and \nfreedom in Africa. We had the honour of hosting the \nheadquarters of the African Liberation Committee in \nDar-es-Salaam until colonialism, apartheid and \nminority rule had been dismantled.  \n \n \n5 11-50865 \n \n We gave sanctuary as well as moral and material \nsupport to almost all the liberation movements of \nSouthern Africa. Here at the United Nations, Tanzania \nwas afforded the rare honour of chairing the United \nNations Special Committee on Decolonization from \n1972 to 1980. That was the critical phase in the \ndecolonization of Africa and in the struggle against \napartheid and minority rule. It is heart-warming indeed \nto see our efforts, sacrifices and contributions being \nrewarded so handsomely with the independence of all \nAfrican countries and with apartheid having been \ndismantled in South Africa.  \n Only Western Sahara remains outstanding. I hope \nthe United Nations will expedite the process so that the \nSaharawi people can determine their future peacefully. \n We believed at independence, as we believe now \nand always will believe, that all human beings are born \nequal and deserve equal protection of their civil, \npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights, as \noutlined in what has come to be known as the \nInternational Bill of Rights. This guides what we are \ndoing at home, with regard to promoting democracy, \nthe rule of law, human rights, including personal \nfreedoms, among them the freedom of expression. \n It is in this spirit also that I wish to reaffirm our \nsolidarity with the Palestinian people in their rightful \nquest for an independent homeland. Our plea is for the \nfulfilment of the vision of two States: the State of \nIsrael and a sovereign, independent, democratic and \nviable State of Palestine, living side by side in peace \nand harmony. That is why we also remain in full \nsolidarity with the people of Cuba in demanding the \nend to the embargo. It is perhaps the longest-lasting \nembargo in history. The people in these three \ncountries \u2014 Israel, Palestine and Cuba \u2014 have \nsuffered for far too long. It is time their burdens are \neased. \n Our other goal was and still is the attainment of \nAfrican unity. We believe in the strength of unity for us \nto be able to effectively face up to and overcome the \ndaunting political, security and development \nchallenges facing our continent. It was in pursuit of \nthis ideal that on 26 April 1964, Zanzibar and \nTanganyika merged to form the United Republic of \nTanzania. We will never tire in our efforts towards the \nrealization of the dream of the founding fathers of a \nUnited States of Africa. However, we are mindful of \nthe fact that this will be a gradual process and regional \neconomic integration and regional groupings will be its \nfoundation and the building blocks. \n After 50 years of independence and 50 years of \nour membership of the United Nations, Tanzania \nremains a firm believer in the indispensability of \nmultilateralism. It is through multilateralism that we \ncan bring all nations and therefore all peoples together \nto shape their common present and future and that of \nthe world they live in. It is through multilateralism that \npeace and development will be guaranteed for all \nnations, through the pursuit of common values. It is for \nthese reasons that I believe the United Nations is \nrelevant today, as it was 66 years ago. It is for the same \nreasons that the world needs the other multilateral \ninstitutions for global economic, social and political \ngovernance. \n Despite acknowledging the importance of various \nmultilateral institutions, Tanzania is of the view that \nthey need to undergo serious reforms to overcome the \nserious governance deficits within them. We need \nreforms that will make them more representative \u2014 in \nparticular, reforms that will increase the voices of the \ndeveloping countries. The original structures have \nignored us. We should not allow this to continue. It is \nfor this reason that Tanzania supported the calls for \nreforms of the Bretton Woods institutions, the United \nNations, the World Trade Organization and the other \nmultilateral institutions.  \n With regard to the United Nations, we should \nexpedite the process of reforming the Security Council, \nin both categories, and in doing so include developing \ncountries, particularly those from Africa, Asia and \nLatin America. It is sad to see that no serious progress \nhas been made for close to two decades. Now is the \ntime for us to start serious negotiations, negotiate in \nearnest and conclude at the earliest possible time. \n Promoting development, particularly shared \ngrowth, has been one of the core functions of the \nUnited Nations. It is pleasing to note that the United \nNations has remained steadfast in its discharge of this \nfunction through its agencies and through a number of \ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations \nHeadquarters itself. United Nations leadership has \nalways been noticeable in all the major socio-economic \nchallenges facing the world: sustainable development, \nhealth care, maternal and child health, poverty, food \nsecurity, education, and so on. This involvement and \nleadership underscores the relevance of the United \n  \n \n11-50865 6 \n \nNations today and the United Nations tomorrow and \nthe day after tomorrow. \n However, the good intentions of the United \nNations have not been fully realized. Some of the \ndeveloped countries have not met their commitments of \nallocating 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product \nto official development assistance. Let me use this \nopportunity to join all those who have spoken before \nme in repeating our appeal to developed countries to \nhonour their commitments.  \n I believe that if this had been done, we would \nhave been on target with the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals and many other \nimportant global matters. I would also like to use this \nopportunity to thank and commend those few \ndeveloped countries that have kept their promise. May \nthe examples of these countries inform and encourage \nthe others to do the same. \n We meet at a time of great uncertainties over the \nglobal economy. Economies are still weak, \ncharacterized by low growth in many major economies, \nhigh levels of inflation, unemployment, increasing \nfood and fuel prices and nervous financial markets. In \na globalized world, ripples of economic and financial \ncrises in the developed economies affect all of us in the \nworld. And for us from poor developing countries, \nmatter get even more complicated.  \n As we all call for concerted global action to \nmaintain economic stability and ensure that we do not \nhead into another global recession, I appeal to the \nUnited Nations to remain seized of the situation and \nexercise its traditional leadership over global issues.  \n This is a matter of great concern to us in Africa, a \ncontinent that has experienced extremely challenging \neconomic, social and political situations, but a \ncontinent that is now poised to go to the next level: \nfrom despair to hope and from lost decades to decades \nfull of opportunities.  \n Democracy is steadily on the march in Africa and \nthe Arab Spring has capped it all. Peace is reigning \nalmost all over the continent. There are no serious \nconflict situations except for Somalia, where the \nserious involvement of the United Nations, the African \nUnion and the world community is still needed. All \nthat Africa needs now is continued support to build the \ninstitutions of democracy and governance, to build our \neconomies and to overcome social challenges.  \n Among the challenges demanding the serious \nattention of this body and the international community \nat large is the continued drought in the Horn of Africa \nand some countries of East Africa. The problem has not \nabated and its consequences are momentous, as \nexemplified by the ongoing famine in Somalia. It is \nhigh time for more attention to be given to the situation \nin this part of Africa, for there is every indication and \nevery reason to believe that the problem is escalating \nand involving more countries. Tanzania is already \nfeeling the pressure of the crisis. \n Piracy is the second problem in our part of the \ncontinent that I would like to mention here today. The \nproblem of piracy still lingers on and it is, in fact, \nexpanding. We are now witnessing more and more \nattacks taking place further to the south of Somalia. \nThey used to take place in the Gulf of Aden, but now \nthe attacks are moving southward, as far as Tanzania, \nMozambique, the Comoros and Madagascar. Since last \nyear, when piracy activity moved to our territorial \nwaters, 13 ships have been attacked and five of them \nwere successfully hijacked. These attacks have caused \nan increase in the cost of shipping to our ports. If we \ndo not succeed in stopping them, they may disrupt \nshipping services and impact negatively on our \neconomy. We need the support of the international \ncommunity to help us build capacity to fight piracy. We \nwelcome the Assembly\u2019s readiness to assist us to \nimprove our courts and prisons to try and punish the \npirates. But if a similar gesture were extended to us to \nbuild capacity to prevent attacks, there would be fewer \npirates to bother us. \n Controversies continue to prevent progress on the \ndraft comprehensive convention on international \nterrorism. The more we delay, the more sophisticated \ninternational terrorism becomes in its strategies and \ntactics. We recently witnessed events in Abuja in which \nthe United Nations was attacked. Tanzania condemns \nthese cruel acts in the strongest terms possible and \nexpresses solidarity with the people of Nigeria and the \nUnited Nations. It is clear that the struggle against \nterrorism must remain a high priority for the United \nNations. \n I would be remiss if I concluded my statement \nwithout acknowledging and thanking the Secretary-\nGeneral for the honour he accorded me and my \ncountry, Tanzania, last year when he formed a \nCommission on Information and Accountability for \nWomen\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health. He appointed me and \n \n \n7 11-50865 \n \nPrime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada to co-chair \nthe Commission. It was an honour to serve on the \nCommission, and I hope that the recommendations we \nmade will help to advance the cause of the noble work \nthat we are all doing to save the lives of millions of \ninnocent women and children who are dying from \ncauses that can be prevented.  \n I end as I began, by reaffirming our faith in the \nUnited Nations, a true embodiment of humanity. We \ndedicate ourselves to respect the values and principles \nenshrined in our Charter and we shall continue to \nplay \u2014 as we have always have done during our first \n50 years as an independent State \u2014 a full, honest and \nconstructive part in the work of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "Let me start by \ncongratulating both the President and the Secretary-\nGeneral on their elections.  \n We live in an era of integration and \ninterconnection. No country can solve all the \nchallenges it faces on its own. Every country should be \npart of the solution. Common responses are needed \nmore than ever. Accordingly, the importance of the \nUnited Nations has grown.  \n The United Nations, or as I like to call it \u2014 the \nG-193 \u2014 has been a success story. The guiding \nprinciples of the United Nations Charter \u2014 peace and \nsecurity, human rights and development \u2014 have served \nus well for decades.  \n The Millennium Development Goals are more \nrecent examples of the global reach of the United \nNations. These Goals have inspired Governments to \nintroduce measures that are saving lives every single \nday.  \n The United Nations has also been at the forefront \nof support for the empowerment of women. The United \nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women gives women and girls an \neven stronger and more unified voice. I have truly \nenjoyed hearing so many speakers today underlining \nthat important trend.  \n Globalization has contributed to substantial \neconomic growth. However, fruits of that growth have \nnot been equally distributed between and within \nnations. That is wrong, and it is not sustainable. It is \nour duty to provide a sustainable future for our planet \nand its people. Sustainability, in brief, is about a \nresilient planet that supports the needs of all people \nworldwide.  \n We, the world community, have accomplished a \nlot since we adopted the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2) and the Millennium Development \nGoals 11 years ago. Both of them have proved to be \neffective tools in the eradication of extreme poverty.  \n But the work must continue with enhanced \ndetermination. We must respect the interdependence of \nthe three dimensions of sustainable development \u2014 the \nsocial, economic and ecological. If even one of these \ndimensions is neglected, development cannot be \nsustainable.  \n Recent events in Northern Africa and the Middle \nEast have once again emphasized that development, \nhuman rights and peace and security are interlinked. \nEveryone must be able to enjoy civil and political as \nwell as economic, social and cultural rights. \n I am pleased to chair the High-level Panel on \nGlobal Sustainability together with President Zuma of \nSouth Africa. We will deliver our recommendations \ntowards the end of this year. The goal of the Panel is to \neradicate poverty and reduce inequality, make growth \ninclusive, and production and consumption more \nsustainable, while combating climate change and \nrespecting the range of other planetary boundaries. We \nare fully convinced that the eradication of poverty and \nsustainable development are interlinked and can be \nreached together. It is really one fight. \n The Panel is building bridges between economy, \necology and social justice. The empowerment of \nwomen and youth is vital for our goal. It is necessary \nto put into use all human resources for the development \nof our societies. \n We have not only discussed setting the goals but \nalso how to reach them. I believe that expanding \n  \n \n11-50692 40 \n \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) into \nsustainable development goals around the year 2015 \ncould help the world community to continue its fight \nagainst poverty and enhance sustainable development. \n In today\u2019s world, there are far too many conflicts. \nAs they often take place within countries, they are \nespecially dangerous for civilians. These asymmetrical \nconflicts usually arise from injustice, violations of \nhuman rights and discrimination against minorities.  \n The President has chosen a very important theme \nfor the general debate, namely mediation. The peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \nmediation are at the very heart of the United Nations. \nMediation has to be used at every stage of conflict. We \nneed to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations \nin this field. Training and guidance are pivotal. \nWomen\u2019s participation and grass-roots activities and \nthe work of non-governmental organizations are also \nvital for our efforts if we want to win. \n On the initiative of Finland and Turkey, the \nGeneral Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution \non mediation in June of this year (resolution 65/283). \nAs has been mentioned today, this is the very first \nresolution on this theme in the history of the United \nNations. The resolution aims at strengthening the role \nof the United Nations in mediation. I would like to \nthank the Member States for their excellent support to \nthis process. Let us continue our common efforts also \nduring the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \nWe are ready for that. \n Peace processes need to be more inclusive. I wish \nto stress the importance of the full and effective \nparticipation of women in all stages of peace processes. \nThe record is far from impressive at the moment, as the \nnumber of women around the negotiation tables \ncontinues to be strikingly low. I welcome the efforts by \nUN-Women to change the situation, and I call upon us \nall to make a commitment to involve more women in \nthis work. \n Finland, my own country, is a strong supporter of \nthe United Nations, in word and deed. We contribute \nmore than our share to peacekeeping, to development \naid and to the promotion of human rights around the \nworld. Finland wishes to continue to carry its \nresponsibilities, with the Assembly\u2019s support, in the \nSecurity Council for the term 2013-2014. Our \ncommitment, our capacity to serve on the Council and \nour record speak for us. \n Finland warmly welcomes the Republic of South \nSudan as the 193rd Member State of the United \nNations. The implementation of the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement has been a testimony to the \nimportance of mediation and regional leadership. I \ncommend the efforts of President Mbeki and his Panel \nto find solutions to outstanding issues between the \nSudan and South Sudan. \n The dramatic and rapidly evolving situation in the \nArab world has been at the centre of the attention of \nthe international community. Women and men have \nmarched together for a better future. It is important that \nthey continue to participate side by side in also \nbuilding a democratic society. Democracy cannot be \nachieved without full participation of women too. \n As we welcome the new Libya into the world \ncommunity, Finland commends the National \nTransitional Council for underlining the need to \ncontinue building a sense of national unity, \nreconciliation and an inclusive political system with \nrespect for equal civil rights and freedom of \nexpression. Finland gives its full support to the \ntransition, reflecting the aspirations of Libyan people. \nWe are ready to support the building of democratic \nsociety based on the rule of law and respect for human \nrights, including the fulfilment of the human rights of \nwomen. The United Nations should play a central role \nin coordinating the international community\u2019s \ncontribution. We very much welcome the United \nNations Support Mission in Libya. \n Reaching a solution to the Middle East conflict is \nmore pressing than ever. The Palestinians have a right \nto their own State, Palestine. The international \ncommunity gathered here in the General Assembly \nmust show that it is united in its message to the parties. \nWe need the urgent resumption of negotiations that will \nlead, within an agreed on time frame, to a two-State \nsolution, with the State of Israel and an independent, \ndemocratic, contiguous and viable State of Palestine \nliving side by side in peace and security. There is no \ntime to waste. \n I have had an opportunity to lead Finland\u2019s \ndelegation to the General Assembly since 1995. We \nhave witnessed a remarkable widening of our common \nglobal agenda. Today\u2019s decisions will affect not only us \nbut also future generations. Change is necessary for the \nsurvival of humankind. I am confident that the United \n \n \n41 11-50692 \n \nNations is the sole universal forum to respond to the \nchallenges that the world is facing. \n I wish those gathered here all the best for the \nfuture."

        "file_text": "As this is the first time I \nhave stood at this rostrum as Prime Minister of Tuvalu \nand participated in the general debate of the General \nAssembly, I am delighted to convey the warmest \ngreetings and best wishes of my people and my \nGovernment, and I am honoured to speak today on \ntheir behalf. Let me first extend my special thanks and \nsincere appreciation to the Government of the United \nStates of America, as the host country, for the warm \nhospitality and special protocols accorded to my \ndelegation since our arrival. \n Ten years ago, Tuvalu established and opened its \nPermanent Mission to the United Nations here in New \nYork, with a mandate to engage more closely with \nnations of the global family. Despite our limited \nresources as one of the smallest Member States, our \npresence is a simple testimony of our hope and trust in \ncollaboration with Member States in the pursuit of our \ndestiny. This further reflects our continued \ncommitment to uphold the maintenance of international \npeace and security, development and human rights as \nfundamental pillars of the United Nations, as enshrined \nin its Charter. \n Tuvalu warmly welcomes and fully supports the \nfour main areas of focus of Mr. Al-Nasser\u2019s presidency, \nincluding the peaceful settlement of disputes, United \nNations reform and revitalization, improving disaster \nprevention and response, and sustainable development \nand global prosperity, which he clearly identified \nduring the opening of the session. In particular, the \ntheme that he proposed for the general debate \u2014 \u201cThe \nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means\u201d \u2014 is timely, considering what is \nhappening around the world today. \n In this context, I wish to express our belated \ntribute and respect to the people and the Government \nof the United States in commemoration of the recent \ntenth anniversary of the events of 11 September 2001. \nTuvalu strongly condemns such terrorist acts and all \nsimilar incidents worldwide, and our prayers are with \nthose who have lost their loved ones. Tuvalu further \nsalutes those who have lost their lives for the cause of \njustice and peace. \n As a peace-loving nation, Tuvalu fully supports \nthe role of the United Nations in the maintenance of \npeace and security across the globe. However, at the \nsame time, the integrity and sovereignty of countries \nshould be respected at all costs. Tuvalu firmly believes \nthat military and violent action should not be used as a \nmeans for the settlement of disputes. Instead, the \nparties concerned should be encouraged to discuss and \nunderstand the root causes of their differences and try \nto listen to each other in a more peaceful manner. \n Today the world is undergoing profound changes \nwithout any boundaries through the unprecedented \nimpacts of globalization and other related global \nevents, which have critical implications for Tuvalu. \nThis has been further exacerbated by the continued \nsevere impact of the global financial and economic \ncrisis, which has had an enormous and critical negative \neffect on Tuvalu\u2019s economy. In particular, the Tuvalu \nTrust Fund, which is the main source of revenue to \nstabilize our recurrent budget, has been severely \naffected. As a consequence, my Government has no \nother option apart from streamlining and containing its \nnational recurrent budget to a sustainable level so as to \n \n \n15 11-51360 \n \nenable the provision of basic services to its people \nduring these difficult times. \n In this regard, I humbly call upon the \ninternational community and development partners to \nurgently fulfil their commitments to assist the least \ndeveloped countries (LDCs), including Tuvalu, through \nthe implementation of the Istanbul Programme of \nAction, adopted at the fourth United Nations \nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in \nTurkey earlier this year. The Istanbul Programme of \nAction is a living document that needs to be \nimplemented vigorously and collectively by LDCs and \nthe international community during the next 10 years. \nIn that regard, I am pleased to confirm that the main \nthrusts of that Programme of Action will be integrated \nand mainstreamed in the Tuvalu National Sustainable \nDevelopment Strategy, during the Fourth United \nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \nscheduled for next month. \n Furthermore, as a least developed country, Tuvalu \nis most vulnerable to global economic shocks, the \nimpacts of climate change and outbreaks of disease, \nincluding non-communicable diseases. Tuvalu \ncontinues to call on and appeal to the United Nations to \ntake those vulnerabilities seriously into consideration \nwhen addressing the question of the graduation of \nLDCs. Despite the ambitious target of the Istanbul \nProgramme of Action for 50 per cent of LDCs to be \ngraduated within the next decade, Tuvalu firmly \nbelieves that its economic and environmental \nvulnerability, coupled with its continuous dependence \non official development assistance, cannot be totally \nignored. In that context, the graduation criteria need to \nbe reviewed to reflect and recognize our vulnerability. \n Last month, Tuvalu published its second \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) Progress \nReport covering the period from 2010 to 2011, which \nhighlights the progress we have made to date towards \nachieving those goals. Despite the ongoing impact of \nrecent global crises, which Tuvalu continues to face, it \nis encouraging to note that five of the MDGs are likely \nto be achieved and three will have mixed results by \n2015. As alluded to earlier, while we have made \nprogress in achieving the MDGs, such progress can be \nreversed overnight because of our particular economic \nand environmental vulnerability. \n The ongoing process and inter-governmental \nnegotiations at the United Nations to revitalize and \nreform the General Assembly and the Security Council \nrespectively are fully supported. However, while we \nrecognize the importance of the reforms being \nundertaken by those United Nations bodies in order to \nupdate their mandates, we are concerned that the time \ntaken to conclude such undertakings is far too long. In \nthat regard, we look forward to a more realistic \ntimetable to complete those negotiations in the near \nfuture, once and for all. \n Our collective efforts to strengthen and maintain \npeace across the globe will be meaningless, if the \nUnited Nations continues to turn blind eyes and deaf \nears to Taiwan\u2019s contribution and efforts toward those \ncommon goals. Furthermore, Taiwan\u2019s continued \ncontribution to the international community as one of \nthe committed development partners cannot be \noveremphasized. In that regard, Tuvalu strongly urges \nthe United Nations to recognize those contributions \nwithout any reservations. In particular, Tuvalu calls \nupon the United Nations subsidiary bodies, especially \nthe World Health Organization and the International \nCivil Aviation Organization, to allow Taiwan to \nparticipate fully and meaningfully in their meetings \nand activities, including in United Nations meetings on \nclimate change. \n Climate change is a priority global issue of the \ntwenty-first century and beyond and therefore requires \na global solution. Climate change impacts countries \nunequally and not all countries possess the same \ncapacity and resilience to adapt and respond to such \nimpacts. For a small island developing State like \nTuvalu, climate change is without a doubt a security \nissue that threatens our survival. At the end of this year \nparties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change will be meeting in Durban to \nadvance our work on climate change. It will be a \ncritical meeting, as time is fast running out for highly \nvulnerable countries like Tuvalu. My country believes \nthe meeting in Durban must deliver key outcomes. \n First, we must adopt amendments to the Kyoto \nProtocol, so as to allow for a second commitment \nperiod. It will be necessary to adopt a decision that \nincludes provisional entry into force of those \namendments to avoid any gap between the first and \nsecond commitment periods. That is necessary in order \nto ensure that the clean development mechanism \ncontinues without any complications and that the \nmechanism continues to provide financing for the \nAdaptation Fund. \n  \n \n11-51360 16 \n \n Secondly, we must make rapid progress in \ndeveloping an international mechanism to address loss \nand damage. For highly vulnerable countries like \nTuvalu, that is vitally important. We need an \ninternational mechanism to spread the burden of \nrebuilding after major weather catastrophes. Thirdly, \nwe must re-focus our work on reducing emissions from \ndeforestation and forest degradation. To properly \nreduce global deforestation we must put in place \nappropriate measures that effectively address its \ncauses. We must look at this from the demand side and \nexplore all means of regulating the trade in products \nthat is driving deforestation. \n Finally, we believe that all major emitting \ncountries must take more decisive action to reduce \ntheir emissions. The current pledging system found in \nthe Canc\u00fan Agreements is inadequate. We will be \nseeking a mandate in Durban to commence \nnegotiations on a new, legally binding agreement for \nthose major emitting countries that have not taken \ncommitments under the Kyoto Protocol. That \nagreement should complement the Kyoto Protocol, but \nnot replace it.  \n As we make progress towards the Rio+20 \nConference next year, we must ensure that there is a \nfocused section dealing with the needs of small island \ndeveloping States. In considering the theme of the \ngreen economy, we must explore carefully how we can \nredirect the current international trading system to \nproperly reflect the needs of small island economies. \nWe need accessible and affordable technologies that \ntake advantage of renewable energy and energy \nefficiency, we need help to protect our blue economies \nand our oceans, and we need to explore new \npreferential trade arrangements to overcome our size \ndisadvantage. \n In conclusion, let me reiterate the severe impact \nof the recent financial and economic crisis and other \nongoing global crises, which continue to affect my \ncountry\u2019s economy and its overall social and economic \ndevelopment. As a small island developing State and a \nleast developed country, vulnerable to such crises and \ndependent on overseas development assistance, Tuvalu \nappeals to the international community to urgently \nhonour and fulfil their commitments and obligations \noutlined in the Istanbul Programme of Action and other \ninternational platforms. We firmly believe that with our \ncontinued cooperation and strong partnerships at all \nlevels, we can successfully overcome those problems \nfor the sake of our people and humankind."

        "file_text": "I \nwould like, on behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan \nand on my own behalf, to congratulate Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to his high and \nresponsible office. I should also like to congratulate the \nAmbassador of Qatar, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, \non his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. The Republic of \nKazakhstan also congratulates the newest Member of \nthe community of nations, the Republic of South \nSudan, on gaining its independence. \n This year, our country celebrates the twentieth \nanniversary of its independence. During this entire \ntime, Kazakhstan has faithfully complied with the \nletter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. First, we \nclosed the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, the largest in \nthe world, thereby becoming one of the world\u2019s first \nnew non-nuclear States. This represents an enormous \ncontribution on the part of my country to global peace \nand stability. \n Secondly, we succeeded in convening the \nConference on Interaction and Confidence-Building \nMeasures in Asia (CICA), which I proposed 19 years \nago in this forum. Today it includes participants from \n29 countries, representing nearly half the world\u2019s \npopulation. Last year, Kazakhstan became the first \ncountry from the Commonwealth of Independent States \nto chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe (OSCE), injecting new energy into every \narea of its work. We also succeeded in holding an \nOSCE summit in our capital, Astana, the first in \n11 years. The adoption of the Astana Declaration has \nhelped to strengthen the OSCE and its efforts to create \na cooperative and indivisible security community \nacross the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions. \nKazakhstan has also called for the establishment of a \nsingle platform for cooperative Eurasian security by \ncombining the capabilities of the OSCE and CICA over \nthe long term. \n This year, Kazakhstan assumed an important \nduty, the chairmanship of the Organization of Islamic \nCooperation (OIC). We have focused our chairmanship\u2019s \nefforts on strengthening international and regional \nsecurity; continuing dialogue between the Islamic \nworld and the West; combating Islamophobia; and \nenhancing programmes promoting the non-proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. The most recent test \nfor the OIC was the humanitarian crisis in Somalia. In \nthat regard, we succeeded in raising $350 million for \nprogrammes designed to deliver food, medical supplies \nand economic restoration to Somalia. \n Thirdly, 140 ethnic groups and 40 religious \ndenominations live in our society in peace and \nharmony. Astana regularly hosts congresses of leaders \nof world and traditional religions. We have offered to \nhold such forums under the auspices of the United \nNations, and they have stabilized the region. That \nrepresents our contribution to the global dialogue on \nconfidence-building in the world. \n Fourthly, our country has demonstrated a \ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals. \nFollowing the break-up of the Soviet Union, we have \nbeen able to move to the forefront in terms of the pace \nof reform and economic growth. In the past two \ndecades, we have posted a 14-fold increase in per \ncapita gross domestic product, from about $700 to \nabout $10,000. \n Fifthly, Kazakhstan has called for the adoption of \na global energy and environment strategy and has put \nforward an ambitious \u201cgreen bridge\u201d environmental \ninitiative. We plan to bring these ideas to the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, to be \nheld in Rio de Janeiro next year. \n The world is entering one of the most critical \nperiods in its history. Humanity has harnessed powerful \nsources of energy but is powerless against the forces of \nnature. Enclaves of poverty and destitution are \nemerging, even in the wealthiest and better-off \ncountries. It is becoming harder and harder to contain \noutbreaks involving ethnic and religious intolerance, \neven in societies with well-established traditions of \ntolerance. \n \n \n21 11-50692 \n \n In today\u2019s inclusive information age, there are no \nreliable means of protection against electronic \nextremism. Ten years ago, the whole world came \ntogether in the face of the terrible tragedy of 9/11. Yet \nno conclusive lessons have been learned from it, and \nthe resurgence of international terrorism is evident in \nvarious parts of the world. These are the main \nchallenges of the new century. \n In that context, I would like to draw the attention \nof participants in this political discussion to the \nfollowing. \n First, we have to address issues related to global \nnuclear safety and security. We call for the start of the \ndrafting of a universal declaration on a nuclear-\nweapon-free world. We have high hopes for the \nNuclear Security Summit, scheduled to be held in \nSeoul in 2012. It is necessary to expand the legal \nframework for, and increase international control by \nthe United Nations and the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, compliance by all countries with their \nobligations in the area of non-proliferation. \n We welcome the Treaty between the United States \nof America and the Russian Federation on Measures \nfor the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic \nOffensive Arms. We consider it important that all \nStates that make up the Nuclear Club join that process. \n Today the world faces a paradoxical situation: \nsome are allowed to possess and upgrade nuclear \nweapons, while others are strictly forbidden to be \nengaged even in research and development. This is \nunjust, disproportionate and unfair. The relevant \nprovisions of international law must thus be reviewed. \nThe idea is to strengthen the responsibility of all \nStates, especially nuclear-weapon States, to reduce \nnuclear weapons and gradually destroy their stockpiles. \n Today there are no clear legal assurances to \nnon-nuclear States by nuclear-weapon Powers. In this \nimportant dimension, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons does not work. At this stage, \nnuclear weapons are not a deterrent but a catalyst of an \narms race. \n In the twenty-first century, general curbs on the \narms race can be effectively provided only by a \ncollegial body with broad powers such as the Security \nCouncil. I also propose that we issue a collective \nappeal on the part of the international community to de \nfacto nuclear-weapon States to renounce their \nambitions and to accede to comprehensive treaties. \n Secondly, the increasing globalization of \neconomic processes requires a paradigm shift in the \neconomic component of the work of the United \nNations. The raison d\u2019\u00eatre of global mechanisms for \ncurrency, trade and economic regulation should be the \nforecasting of global crises and the elimination of their \ncauses. \n It is generally agreed today that the current global \ncrisis was caused by deficiencies in the global financial \nsystem. However, to date no significant steps to \naddress its flaws have been taken. Procrastination in \ntackling this issue will result in new and violent \nmanifestations of the crisis and a surge of regional and \nglobal instability. \n It is important to establish an effective global \neconomic governance mechanism, with clear powers \nand lines of accountability involving all institutions \nand actors, an effective global reserve currency and \ntight control over speculative capital. In this context, a \npact on global regulation would seem quite relevant. \n The prevention of global hunger and the growing \nscarcity of water are other important issues. \n Thirdly, information space is a sphere that is as \nimportant to the future of humanity as mineral \nresources, air, the aquatic world and outer space. Yet \ntoday not a single international convention or \nmultilateral treaty governs information processes. Is \nthat not the reason why, in practical terms, most hacker \nattacks on banks, businesses, Government institutions, \nthe military and even nuclear facilities have been able \nto be carried out with impunity? \n I consider it important to establish an \ninternational legal framework for global information \nspace. The resolution on nine elements of a global \nculture of cybersecurity (resolution 57/239), adopted \nby the General Assembly in 2002, could serve as a \nbasis for such efforts. \n Fourthly, the new world order is taking shape \nagainst the backdrop of increasing conflicts. It is quite \nsignificant that today the world\u2019s total military \nspending is growing twice as fast as it did during the \ncold war \u2014 by 6 per cent a year, reaching $1.5 trillion. \nIn this regard, my initiative to establish a United \nNations peacekeeping fund, which I put forward for the \nfirst time 19 years ago, has become even more \n  \n \n11-50692 22 \n \nrelevant. This would involve each State Member of the \nUnited Nations allotting 1 per cent of its military \nbudget for that purpose. I urge the international \ncommunity to consider this idea once again and take \nthe required action. \n Sixty-six years ago, the United Nations was \nfounded as an organization based on the principle of \nthe sovereign equality of all its Members. However, \none cannot but notice how today the principle of \nnational sovereignty and territorial integrity is being \neroded. That could undermine trust between nations. \nToday it is essential to upgrade the norms of \ninternational law concerning the national sovereignty \nof States and, taking into account new realities, clearly \ndefine the bounds beyond which the involvement of the \ninternational community in the settlement of internal \nconflicts is warranted. \n Global peace will be enhanced only if the United \nNations works more closely with regional security \narrangements. With respect to the Eurasian region, \nthese are the Conference on Interaction and \nConfidence-building Measures in Asia, the Shanghai \nCooperation Organization and the Collective Security \nTreaty Organization. It is important to ensure that the \ncomposition and the work of the Security Council \nadequately reflect the structure of the modern world. At \nthe same time, the veto mechanism will guarantee that \nthe decisions that are adopted are balanced and \neffective. \n Kazakhstan has announced its candidacy for a \nnon-permanent seat in the Security Council for 2017-\n2018. We count on the support of the international \ncommunity in this respect. \n The complex question of Palestine has been \nactively discussed these days. Kazakhstan supports the \ncreation of a Palestinian State. A difficult issue, \nhowever, has been placed on the scales of history; \nPresident Obama spoke about this. For the long-\nsuffering Palestinian people, like the Israeli people, the \nnegotiating process has been ongoing for more than \n50 years. Without independence and their own State, \nthe Palestinians will not be able to achieve sustainable \npeace in the Middle East. \n Each new era in the history of humanity gives \nrise to formidable challenges. Today, the most \nimportant task is to successfully navigate the complex \nglobal transformations of the twenty-first century. \nTrust and unity among all nations will be a pillar of an \nequitable new world order.

        "file_text": "We praise Almighty \nGod for making another gathering of world leaders \npossible. Allow me to warmly congratulate \nMr. Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His proven \nleadership and competence will certainly be in great \ndemand as we collectively confront some of the \ndaunting challenges of our time. My delegation also \nviews his election as a demonstration of the strong \ncommitment of the brotherly State of Qatar to the \nfashioning of a stable and just world order. He will \nhave our full support in the discharge of his mandate. \n His predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland, \nalso deserves our praise for the sterling work he did as \nPresident of the General Assembly. We wish him well \nin his future pursuits. We also congratulate Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment and wish \nhim a fruitful second term. My delegation will render \nhim all the support he will need as he helps to tackle \nthe issues that are dear to us, especially the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) and the resolution of conflicts in Africa, \namong others. \n The United Nations was founded as a world body \nprimarily to maintain international peace and security. \nFor this reason, the theme chosen for this General \nAssembly \u2014 \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement \nof disputes by peaceful means\u201d \u2014 is particularly apt. \nMy delegation is a strong believer in the role of \nmediation as a conflict resolution mechanism at both \nthe national and international levels. We can all agree \nthat mediation produces results. That is what our \nexperience in West Africa, my own part of the world, \ntells us. At the national level, for example, in the \nGambia we have instituted the alternative dispute \nresolution mechanism, among other mechanisms we \nhave in place, with a view to settling disputes between \nand among our peoples and institutions. \n For us in Africa, the mediation of conflicts, \nparticularly with a view to amicably resolving them, \nhas always been part and parcel of our rich cultural \nheritage and customary law. We must revive those \ntime-honoured dispute-resolution traditions of our \nforebears. Experience has also shown that with strong \nregional and subregional leadership many of the \nintractable civil, political and electoral conflicts that \nbeset and plague Africa could certainly be resolved \nthrough mediation.  \n Regional ownership of mediation processes is \nalso essential. For example, recent conflicts in Guinea \nand Guinea-Bissau were all resolved through a \ncombination of interventions by the Economic \nCommunity of West African States, the African Union \n(AU) and the United Nations. We must therefore \nalways give mediation a chance before resorting to the \nuse or threat of the use of force. The international \ncommunity must give priority to mediation in any \nconflict before it threatens military invasion or outright \nmilitary intervention without giving mediation a \nchance. It costs less to mediate \u2014 we all agree \u2014 than \nto launch a full-scale military intervention, only to \nhave to come back again and rebuild and reconstruct. \n Over the past decade, the leadership of West \nAfrica, in close collaboration with the international \ncommunity, has invested great material and human \nresources to bring the conflicts that affected that region \nto peaceful ends. Today, the region enjoys relative \npeace, but that does not mean that spoilers have given \nup attempts to derail the peace. We must be vigilant at \nall times. For example, the evils of drug trafficking, \npiracy, and the trafficking of illicit goods and arms \nhave reared their ugly heads across our subregion of \nWest Africa. The nature and extent of those crimes call \nfor swift international action to nip them in the bud \nbefore it is too late.  \n All these crimes feed on each other and sow the \nseeds of terror, economic sabotage and indeed the \ncollapse of social order. We must therefore pool our \nresources in the areas of detection, surveillance, law \nenforcement and prosecution in order to deny the \nculprits safe havens. In order to do that, we must come \ntogether and agree on a framework for cooperation, of \n \n \n15 11-51384 \n \ncourse with the support of the international community. \nWe look forward to greater United Nations engagement \nwith regional and subregional leaders and \norganizations in stamping out those menaces. \n The Gambia will always be an agent of peace \nthrough mediation and shuttle diplomacy in West \nAfrica and beyond. As we have done in the past, we \nwill support all efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution \nof conflicts and disputes within our subregion. We will \nalso continue to contribute to United Nations \npeacekeeping missions around the world, as we have \nalready done. \n With strong African leadership, we continue to \nwitness the amicable resolution of many civil conflicts \nthat plague the continent. The key lesson in most of \nthose situations is early intervention by leaders who \nmediate between stakeholders. Regional leaders should \nalways be put at the forefront of mediation efforts.  \n For that reason, we salute the untiring leadership \nof the African Union in bringing about peace in the \nSudan. We equally salute the leadership of the Sudan \nfor its magnanimity in implementing the \nComprehensive Peace Accord, which led to the \nindependence of South Sudan. My delegation \nencourages both sides to invest in their shared future \nthrough a negotiated settlement of the pending issues.  \n Let me also take this opportunity to encourage \nour brothers in Guinea and Niger, after successful \ndemocratic transitions, to bury the hatchet and move \nforward as united peoples. National reconciliation \nefforts should be diligently pursued by all stakeholders. \nWe therefore call on the international community to \nrender them all the support they need as they try to \nbring peace and development to their countries. \n As a developing country, like all others we have \nour eyes set on the countdown to 2015, a landmark \nyear for all of us. The Gambia and the entire \ninternational community have only a few more years \nbefore we can tell how many of the MDGs we have \nmet. What is evident from all the reviews, however, is \nthat we are surely on track to meet some of the MDGs \nbut still struggling to meet others. We know for certain, \nfor example, that the critical element for achieving all \nMDGs on the target date will remain international \ndonor support and collaboration. We have just \nembarked upon our new programme for accelerated \ngrowth and employment, which is our blueprint for \ndevelopment in the Gambia for 2012-2015, which we \nearnestly believe will be generously supported by all \nour development partners and friends. \n It is no secret that the ongoing financial and \neconomic crisis, worsened by market volatility, is \ntaking a huge toll on the meagre economic gains of our \nfragile economies. In view of our situation as least \ndeveloped countries and of the vulnerabilities that we \ncontinue to encounter, it is urgent that we all support \nthe implementation of the Istanbul Programme of \nAction. We must not allow it to suffer the fate of its \npredecessor, which suffered from weak \nimplementation.  \n It is our hope that our partners from the North \nwill do all in their power to support the enhancement \nof our productive capacities. We also call on the \nemerging economies of the South to enhance their \ncooperation with us in ways that will render true \nmeaning to South-South cooperation. My delegation is \nready at all times to forge meaningful partnerships \nacross the North and South in order to bring food \nsecurity to our people, tackle youth unemployment \nthrough education and skill development, and enhance \nthe quality and coverage of our health-care delivery \nsystems.  \n In addition, we have to revisit the various \nprogrammes and strategies adopted by the Food and \nAgricultural Organization of the United Nations and \nother global forums in order to comprehensively \naddress the food security needs of developing \ncountries. The small-scale farmer \u2014 including the \nfemale farmer \u2014 must be placed at the centre of the \nnew Green Revolution. \n The impact of climate change continues to pose a \nformidable challenge to all of us. The solutions to \nreversing the negative impacts of climate change \nthrough adaptation and mitigation initiatives are well \nknown. Our problem today is the refusal of the biggest \npolluters to assume their responsibilities in reversing \nthe negative trends of climate change occasioned by \nhuman activity. We cannot afford to be in denial for \nlong. The science is solid and there for all to see, and \nthe solutions are very clear, so let us embrace them by \nfulfilling our international obligations.  \n The 2012 United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development (Rio+20) should be about the \nimplementation of commitments and not about \nreneging on them. It should also be about the \nannouncement of workable initiatives and not about the \n  \n \n11-51384 16 \n \nrepackaging of previous unfulfilled commitments. \nRio+20 should ultimately be about binding \ncommitments. Let us bequeath to our children, and \ntheir children an Earth that is resilient and a better \nworld for them. \n My delegation would like to congratulate the \ndelegation of Libya, especially the leadership of the \nNational Transitional Council, on being steadfast in \ntheir drive to rescue Libya from the brink of the abyss. \nWe have faith in that leadership and are convinced that \nit will institute the necessary reforms that the Libyan \npeople have so valiantly fought for. As Libya embarks \non the crucial task of reconciliation, reconstruction and \nnation building, we \u2014 as the first African country to \nhave officially announced its recognition of and \nsupport for the National Transitional Council \u2014 would \nlike to assure the Libyan leadership of our full \ncollaboration and solidarity at all times. \n The conflicts in the Middle East, both recent and \nlong-standing, require fresh and honest mediation \nefforts with a view to stabilizing the region once and \nfor all. The disorderly change that is sweeping across \nthe region is a cause for concern as livelihoods are \nshattered and industries like tourism are destroyed, \nthereby creating more unemployment and entrenching \nendemic poverty. With regard to the Arab Spring, my \ndelegation fully supports and hereby salutes the \nleadership role of the League of Arab States, the \nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation and the Gulf \nCooperation Council in finding peaceful resolution to \nthose conflicts through mediation, diplomacy and \nbrotherhood.  \n In the same vein, we salute the role the AU has \nbeen playing in bringing to an end some of the most \nviolent conflicts in human history on the African \ncontinent through mediation and in some cases through \nmilitary intervention as a last resort. We have used \nformer Heads of State as mediators in Africa and in \ncouncils of the wise, and some of those efforts have \nproven to be very successful. \n One of the most intractable conflicts of our time \nis the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The sad reality is that \nnumerous United Nations resolutions continue to be \nflouted. The daily killing, collective punishment and \nhumiliation of Palestinians are going on unabated. \nDenial of humanitarian assistance, essential medical \nsupplies and construction materials to Palestinians has \nbecome the norm. For that reason, my delegation not \nonly supports but recognizes an independent and \nsovereign Palestinian State within the confines of the \n1967 borders. An independent Palestinian State with \nfull rights and privileges like any other is long \noverdue. That is the only guarantor of lasting peace in \nthat region. \n The Islamic religion, which is synonymous with \npeace, is misunderstood and misrepresented in some \nquarters. We condemn those who turn themselves into \nsuicide bombers to kill innocent people or conduct \ninhuman behaviour in the name of Islam, as such acts \nare contrary to Islamic values and teachings. Muslims, \nChristians, Jews and peoples of other faiths must all \njoin hands, for once, in fighting terrorism of all shades. \nWe must also be tolerant and indeed respectful of each \nother, no matter our beliefs, and live side by side in \npeace and harmony as one human race and one human \nfamily. \n In the case of Syria, we call on the international \ncommunity to encourage and support the Syrian \nGovernment and people to resolve their internal \nproblems through diplomacy and peaceful means. \nPoverty should not be a pretext for violent and \ndisorderly change of Government in developing \ncountries. \n The need for constructive dialogue in finding \nlasting and timely solutions to transboundary problems, \nwherever they exist, is more urgent today than ever \nbefore. Let us avoid postponing the search for a \npermanent solution to the decades-old conflict in the \nNagorno Karabakh region. It is the responsibility of the \ninternational community to work with a greater sense \nof urgency to address the Nagorno Karabakh conflict \nwithout further delay. \n The developments in Cuba continue to \ndemonstrate to the world the inhumanity of \nmaintaining the decades-old embargo imposed on that \nfriendly country. The embargo is a manifestation of \nintolerance of other people\u2019s right to a political system \nof their choice. There is universal agreement that the \nembargo needs to come to an end without precondition \nand be replaced with good-neighbourliness, tolerance \nand respect for the legitimate right of Cubans to have a \npolitical system of their choice. We therefore once \nagain call on the United States of America to lift the \nsanctions and embargo on Cuba now. \n The case of Taiwan deserves better scrutiny by \nthe international community. Taiwan, with a population \n \n \n17 11-51384 \n \nof 23 million people, continues to play an active and \npositive role on the international stage. In a highly \nintegrated and interconnected world, almost all issues \ndemand the full participation of and cooperation \namong all nations. Taiwan\u2019s efforts in promoting peace, \nparticularly in the Asia-Pacific region, deserve \ncommendation and further encouragement by the \nGeneral Assembly.  \n For example, over the past three years, Taiwan \nhas engaged mainland China in dialogue on a wide \nrange of issues ranging from agriculture and health to \nintellectual property rights and economic and \ncommercial cooperation, among others. Furthermore, \nsince 2009 Taiwan has been invited by the World \nHealth Organization to attend the World Health \nAssembly (WHA) as an observer. That practice and the \nrelated arrangements have established what has been \ntermed the WHA model, which sets a useful precedent \nfor Taiwan\u2019s greater participation in the United Nations \nsystem generally. \n Given that Taiwan is today one of the leading \ntechnological and economic powerhouses of the world, \nits participation in global affairs is quite relevant, \nbearing in mind the numerous issues that we \ncollectively confront. We must give it the prominence \nthat it deserves. Issues such as natural disasters, \nterrorism, climate change, epidemics, financial \nmeltdowns and many others require the engagement of \nevery member of the international community, \nincluding Taiwan. We therefore urge the United \nNations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan\u2019s \nmeaningful participation in the specialized agencies \nand mechanisms of the United Nations system, \nincluding the International Civil Aviation Organization \nand the United Nations Climate Change Conferences \nimmediately. \n Reform should be a permanent feature on the \nagenda of all international organizations. Cosmetic \nreforms or the deliberate stalling of overdue reforms \nseriously undermine the effective responsiveness of \norganizations. In 2005, as we all remember, a draft of \nreform measures was introduced by the General \nAssembly, which led to reforms in management of the \nSecretariat, human resources administration, the \ncreation of the Human Rights Council, the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the elaboration of new \nnorms. \n The then Secretary-General remarked that no \nreform of the United Nations is complete without \nreform of the Security Council. Let us not delude \nourselves. The Security Council urgently needs \ncomprehensive reforms. A major element in the reform \nof the Council is the glaring underrepresentation of \nAfrica, for example, in all its categories of \nmembership. Africa certainly needs to be adequately \nand properly represented, and we will not give up on \nwhat is a legitimate demand. What is even more \nappalling is that negotiations are progressing at a \nsnail\u2019s pace. Although we are mindful of other \npositions, we are convinced that negotiations must lead \nto a just outcome. Security Council reform is long \noverdue, and the lack of it is undermining the \ncredibility of our Organization and the legitimacy of \nthe Council\u2019s decisions. \n In conclusion, my delegation would like to repeat \nwhat we said before. Reform of the United Nations \nmust recognize the geopolitical realities of the African \ncontinent and its peoples. Africa is no longer the \ncolony of any country and must be respected and \ntreated as such. The system of veto power and flawed \nrepresentation in the Security Council is not \nacceptable, can no longer be tolerated and in fact runs \ncounter to the spirit and letter of the basic principles of \nequality and fair play as enshrined in the United \nNations Charter."

        "file_text": "\nThis new session of the Assembly of the United \nNations brings us together at what is no doubt an \nhistoric time of great importance, as has been said in \none way or another by the various leaders who have \npreceded me at this rostrum. These are certainly critical \ntimes that should lead us to adopt an attitude that goes \nbeyond addressing the specific questions of the \nmoment, because this is a moment of change in the \nhistory of humankind. On the economic, social and \ngeopolitical levels there are many signs indeed that \nshow us that the world is changing and that the \ntransition towards something new, even if still \nundefined, is already under way and will follow its \ncourse, whether we are able to understand it or not.  \n That is why our peoples desire political \nleadership that is able to respond to this time of \nuncertainty. Our societies demand of us that we be \nable, first of all, to understand and explain to them \nwhat is really going on. They also demand of us that \nwe listen to their needs and satisfy those needs and, \nabove all, that we reach a new international consensus \nin order to make that necessary qualitative global leap \nin order to achieve a planet of greater justice, stability \nand safety.  \n This is, therefore, an opportunity to reconsider \nour policies, to review and change paradigms that seem \nto be frozen, to renew the international debate and to \nbe ambitious in our aspirations as a global society. \nMembers know that nothing undermines the morale \nand spirit of our peoples more than fear, uncertainty \nand distrust. It is those evils that are affecting our \nplanet currently. We are suffering from fear in its \nvarious guises. Millions of demoralized, unemployed \npeople live in daily uncertainty, not knowing whether \nthere is a future for them and their children. Entire \ncountries have seen their economies stumble because \nof that lack of confidence. Hundreds of thousands of \nfamilies every day face the fear that takes the form of \npolitical instability, natural disasters, the lack of urban \n  \n \n11-51185 12 \n \nsafety, and poverty. All those people demand that their \nleaders give them the inspiration to overcome that fear, \nto regain a sense of collective self-esteem and to \nbelieve in a different and better future. That is the great \nhistorical challenge that we must shoulder with \nresponsibility and courage. \n We must forge a new international agreement that \nwill allow us to overcome such fears and lack of \nconfidence in order once again to stride forward. \nTherefore we must not allow that fear to be translated \ninto timid or cowardly political and economic \ndecisions that would deprive us of an opportunity to \nundertake the changes that our people are calling for. \nWe must not betray their historic will for \ntransformation and development. It would be \nunpardonable, unforgivable, if we were to allow \nourselves to be lulled by old political and economic \ndogma and continue repeating once again the same \nmistakes, while overwhelming majorities in every city, \nin every State, on every continent, have clearly \nexpressed their desire for a new, audacious and creative \npolicy. \n Over the past 30 years, while the economy has \ngrown exponentially, so has the root cause of many of \nour misfortunes, and here I am referring to injustice. \nDaily injustice has a most significant effect on our \npeoples. It affects their options for health, education \nand social development in very tangible ways. That \ninequality has disastrous consequences, which has been \ntried, tested and understood by some of the wealthiest \nentrepreneurs, who are in favour of paying more taxes, \nas they are aware that adopting any other position \nwould sentence us to a harsh future, even for those \nliving at ease.  \n The fight against poverty and inequality, as was \nrecalled at the inaugural meeting of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly by the President of Brazil, Dilma \nRousseff, has proven to be the strongest economic \npolicy in these difficult times. Therefore, it is time that \nwe no longer see our future in terms of macroeconomic \ndata but that we start to focus our political debate on \nour peoples\u2019 needs and on social justice, which is what \nthe debate should always have focused on. Any other \ndebate would be sterile and would only lead us away \nfrom the common objective that should govern all our \npolicies, namely, the objective of the common good. \n The unstable reality that we have experienced \nalso takes the form of conflicts which, increasingly, \ncall upon the indistinct arbiter, who goes by the name \nof the \u201cinternational community\u201d and which is \nrepresented here in the General Assembly better than \nanywhere else. In that regard I welcome the fact that \none of the central themes of this session is the search \nfor the peaceful settlement of conflicts and prevention \nstrategies to cope with situations of instability. This \nshows us that the arbiter is growing stronger, as are the \npossibilities to prevent injustice and human rights \nabuses wherever they occur. The United Nations arose \nout of the global desire to avoid a new major conflict, \nand that spirit of peace and harmony must continue to \nguide us in our actions, even when the conflicts that we \nface currently are very different from the conflicts of \nthe twentieth century. Indeed, we are living in a most \ndiverse and complex world where there are no magical \nformulas or quick fixes but common responsibility, \nwhich is committed to finding new avenues for \npeacemaking and justice extending beyond our national \nborders.  \n That resolve must also translate into our quest for \nsolutions to what is one of the oldest conflicts on this \nplanet, and I am referring here to the Arab-Israeli \nconflict. As members know, my country recently \ndecided to recognize the Palestinian State. This in no \nway seeks to undermine our good diplomatic relations \nwith Israel. We are of the view that both peoples have \nthe right and duty to coexist. Recognizing Palestine as \na new State within the United Nations is, in my \nopinion, the right way to contribute to resolving the \nconflict. With this firm belief we support all diplomatic \nefforts that are aimed at achieving a peaceful \nsettlement of this long-standing conflict. We firmly \nbelieve that dialogue is the only possible solution, and \nour actions have always been guided by that principle. \n Now I should like to refer to the main enemy, not \nonly of my country and Central America but of a large \nportion of the American continent. I am referring here, \nof course, to organized crime and drugs trafficking. As \nwas rightly stated by President Calder\u00f3n of Mexico \nfollowing the terrible attack that occurred in a casino in \nMonterrey, we are facing a veritable phenomenon of \nterrorism that threatens the viability of our countries, \nhas taken more lives than many wars, and which \nendangers the present and future of our peoples. Many \nLatin American countries represented here have \nbecome, against their will, true corridors for illegal \ntrafficking, thus becoming nations increasingly \naffected by violence, with institutions that are \n \n \n13 11-51185 \n \nsusceptible to corruption. Because of their poor \neconomies of scale, their lack of development and the \nweakness of their productive machinery owing to \nwidespread poverty and high levels of inequality, poor \nStates are threatened by this new form of terrorism that \nhas forged a strong economic network. All of the \ncartels that are operating in the Mesoamerican \nregion \u2014 Mexico and Central America \u2014 possess \nmore money and influence than our countries do. \n It is true to say that we are the true victims of \norganized crime. It is our territories and peoples that \nsuffer from this violence and who weep for their dead. \nThese are not mere empty statements. Studies have \nshown that violence and crime are 100 per cent more \nlikely in regions that facilitate illegal trafficking than \nanywhere else on the planet. Our countries are \nsuffering as a result of this. El Salvador and all of \nCentral America are undertaking significant efforts to \ndeal with this fact but the figures are not on our side. \nWe are speaking of a drug-trafficking route that moves \n$100 billion a year and which leads to the largest \nmarket in the world, as well as the largest consumer of \nthese substances, the United States. Consider this: \n$100 billion across our territories along with a \nveritable arsenal of weapons to protect this amount. \nThat means $100 billion dollars that can corrupt public \nand private officials, destroy our social fabric and \nleave behind them a daily wake of chaos and death.  \n How therefore can countries such as El Salvador \nwith a gross domestic product of about $22 billion, or a \ncountry such as Honduras with roughly $15 billion, or \nGuatemala which barely reaches $40 billion, deal with \nthis enemy? Not even a large country such as Mexico \ncan successfully wage this battle on its own in dealing \nwith this terrorist strength. It is not scepticism that \nleads me to speak this way but rather a sense of realism \nin keeping with the reality experienced by Central \nAmerican peoples on a daily basis. \n I wish to draw attention to this. The international \ncommunity must understand that it is also affected by \nthis problem. No nation on this planet is spared this \nproblem. There are drug users in every nation in the \nworld, who get their drugs from the criminal drug-\ntrafficking networks. That means that the fight against \norganized crime is a common struggle and, in that \nregard, I wish to make a special and hopeful call upon \nthe people and Government of the United States \nresolutely to lead us in this the good fight against drug-\ntrafficking and organized crime. I believe that the \nGovernment of the United States must lead us in the \nstruggle with great resolve. It must make the \ncommitment and apply all its economic, human, \ntechnological and political resources in waging the \nstruggle, which is indeed the harshest war to affect our \ncontinent. \n The violence that is fuelled by drugs trafficking \nand by its machinery of death has taken more lives in \nMesoamerica than conflicts that occur elsewhere on \nthis planet. That is why I wish to draw attention to and \ninvite all Members to focus on this shocking fact. We \nrequire the firm resolve of our great North American \nneighbour in order to strike the necessary blows to \nweaken and end this criminal phenomenon. Naturally, \nthat does not mean that our countries will in any way \nshirk their share of the responsibility. We shall \ncontinue to strengthen our institutions, to reform our \nsecurity forces, to strengthen our presence on the \nground in order to protect our young people from \ncriminal gangs. At the regional level we are working \ntogether and have undertaken significant steps in a \ncommon undertaking by sharing strategies and tasks \nwith Mexico, Colombia and the United States. \n Of course, these are truly difficult challenges that \nlie ahead. Many of these challenges were referred to by \nthe President of Mexico \u2014 the fight against money-\nlaundering, disarmament, crime prevention, an \neffective judiciary \u2014 and will require the reform of our \njudicial organs. Inevitably, organized crime has \ninfiltrated the organs of the State, in particular the \njudiciary and the police forces. That is why we must \nwage a strong fight in order to clean up those \ninstitutions. \n But the consumer countries, in this case chiefly \nthe United States, are morally responsible in this \nstruggle that must be seen not only as a criminal \nproblem but also as a matter of public health. While \ndrugs consumption and narcotics use grow, the \nbusiness of drugs trafficking will remain powerful. In \nshort, we call once again for North American \nleadership in this common struggle that we are waging \nalongside Mexico, Colombia and all of Central \nAmerica.  \n Struggles such as these, which are being waged \nacross the American continent, once again show how \nimportant it is to have a strong and united America. \nUnity is a necessary prerequisite in order to meet our \ncommon goals. Given this need, I now wish to refer to \n  \n \n11-51185 14 \n \nthe blockade against the Republic of Cuba. We believe \nthat this blockade is an anachronism from a past page \nof history that we wish to turn once and for all. \nEssentially a blockade against Cuba is a step towards \ndisunity. It is a stumbling block on the road of history \nthat weakens us as a continent. \n At the start of my statement I spoke of the \nleadership that our peoples expect from us in these \ndifficult times, of the courage that we need in order to \nface the challenges that extend beyond our borders and \nalso of this great opportunity before us now. Let us \nshow that leadership, from the smallest country, such \nas my own, to the great Powers. Let us show an \nunequivocal will to achieve peace, social justice and \nthe well-being of the men and women who place their \nfaith in us, in particular in times such as these when \ncrisis once again threatens our peoples. Let us not fail \nthem once more. We should not favour those in power \nwho triggered the crisis but rather the weakest, who are \naffected by it."

        "file_text": "It is of course a great \nhonour and a profound responsibility to address the \nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly on behalf \nof my people. \n The United Nations is the international \ncommunity\u2019s great legacy of the past century, an \ninstitution resulting both from history\u2019s most \noutrageous crimes and from humankind\u2019s capacity to \nconfront, reckon with and overcome the consequences \nof such crimes. Such human contradictions \u2014 \u201cthe \nhighest heaven and the deepest abyss\u201d, to quote \nFriedrich Schelling \u2014 are symbolized by the two \nremarkable anniversaries we commemorate this year. I \nam surprised that no one in the Hall has mentioned that \nthis year marks the twentieth anniversary of the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union, which freed captive \nnations and emancipated oppressed peoples, unleashed \nthe dreams of millions, put an end to decades of cold \nwar and an apocalyptic nuclear race and heralded a \nnew era of international relations. It was clearly not, as \none nostalgic leader put it, the biggest geopolitical \ncatastrophe of the twentieth century. Nor was it, as \nsome analysts and diplomats dreamed, the end of \nhistory.  \n Ten years later, in this very city, another major \nevent took place, this time a real catastrophe. It \nreminded us in the most horrific way that history was \nnot over and that it remained tragic. On that terrible \nday, even those who had failed to pay heed to a decade \nof grim wars in the Balkans and the Caucasus, in \nAfrica and in Afghanistan, had to abandon their \nillusions that a new world order free of conflicts had \nemerged for good. \n The attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., \nwere not aimed at a single country, but instead targeted \na set of values and a way of life \u2014 freedom and \ndemocracy. That day, 11 September 2001, reminded us \nthat the world remained a true battlefield \u2014 a \nbattlefield not among religions, as many people claim, \nor of nations, but a battlefield within every religion, \nevery nation and every culture; a battlefield between \nthose who try to build and those who seek to destroy, \nbetween those who choose freedom and those who \npledge to eradicate it; a battlefield between nihilism \nand the very idea of civilization.  \n Ten years later, the remarkable upheavals in the \nArab world have offered us yet more proof that there is \nno end to history, nor is there a clash of civilizations. \nInstead, a universal call to freedom is rising even in \nplaces where some doubted it could ever rise. It is \nbeing met by a monstrous effort to quell it. As we \nspeak, the highest heaven and the deepest abyss are \nonce again in conflict. It is our duty as leaders to weigh \nin and speak out, to decide and to act. \n The first anniversary I evoked earlier \u2014 the fall \nof Soviet tyranny \u2014 continues to reverberate today in \nimportant ways. When the moment came 20 years ago \nfor us, the former subjects of the Soviet bureaucracy \u2014 \nstudents, artists, dissidents, workers, men and women, \nold and young \u2014 it was hardly the end of history; on \nthe contrary, it was a new beginning of history. \nCommunism had frozen our will in a cold and closed \nmuseum. When it collapsed, the doors of history swung \nopen again. We found ourselves confronted at once by \nboth the best and the worst. The best transpired for \nthose nations quickly integrated into the European \nUnion and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The \nothers \u2014 like the people of my country, Georgia \u2014 \n \n \n7 11-50871 \n \nwere left to the mercy of failed States, civil unrest, \nwars, ethnic cleansing and foreign occupation. \n Two years ago, from this very podium, I \nsuggested that there were two ways to leave \ncommunism behind and to re-enter history \u2014 the way \nof Vaclav Havel and the way of Slobodan Milo\u0161evic, \nthe way of liberal democracy and tolerance, on one \nside, and the way of authoritarianism and ethnic \nnationalism, on the other. There are, in other words, \nmen who embrace freedom and men who erect mental \nand physical walls against it. \n To the latter, who still see the extension of the \nEuropean Union and NATO as a threat, I would like to \nsay that the Cold War ended in December 1991 and \nthat they should not be afraid of having democratic \nneighbours who wish to join wider democratic clubs. \nThere is no hidden agenda or secret plot in any of those \ncapitals to undermine the sovereignty of big nations. \nThe Cold War ended 20 years ago and, slowly \u2014 too \nslowly \u2014 new rules are emerging. And even those \nrules are still too rarely applied. \n Little by little, tyrants are beginning to fear that \nthey could one day be held accountable for their \ncrimes. I am convinced that there will be less and less \ntolerance for the ethnic cleansing and other war crimes \nthat have stained my country and so many others. That \nis the very reason for the existence as the United \nNations, is it not? The United Nations exists to make \nthe world a little better, to finally enforce the rules, \ncharters, laws and principles upon which we have all \ncome to agree. \n It is time to understand that the world has \nchanged and that an army, as powerful as it might \nseem, cannot ultimately deny the will of the people; \nthat a Government, as strong as it might look, cannot \nunilaterally and freely dismember sovereign nations; \nand that we are not in 1938 or in 1968, but in 2011. \n As I speak, the Russian Federation militarily \noccupies 20 per cent of sovereign Georgian territory, in \nviolation of international law and the 12 August 2008 \nceasefire agreement. As I speak, almost 500,000 \ninternally displaced persons and refugees in a country \nof less than 5 million people continue to suffer because \nthey are denied their right, a right reaffirmed over a \ndozen times by this very body, to return to their homes \nand villages. They cannot go back because, in Moscow, \na foreign leader has decided that their home is no \nlonger their home. \n To such cynicism and brutality we respond with \ncalls for justice and commitments to peace. Last year, \non 23 November, I addressed the European Parliament \nand solemnly pledged that Georgia would never use \nforce to liberate those of its regions currently occupied \nby the Russian Federation. Even though the United \nNations Charter gives us the authority to do so, as we \nwell know, we definitively renounced military means \nto restore our territorial integrity. The commitment I \nmade before the European Parliament is legally \nbinding; I have sent relevant letters to the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations and to other \ninternational organizations. \n It will soon be one year since Georgia renounced \nthe use of force. One year has passed, and we are still \nwaiting for Russia\u2019s leadership to reciprocate this \ngesture of peace. Unfortunately, instead of dialogue, \nthe response we have received has come in the form of \na dozen terrorist acts targeting Georgia, attacks directly \norganized and supervised by confirmed officers of the \nRussian secret services, which has been authenticated \nby different international actors. \n The Cold War is over, but some leaders have yet \nto realize that fact and stop reasoning in terms of \nspheres of influence, near-abroad domination and zero-\nsum games. The Cold War is over, but embargoes, \nblackmail and brutal diktats are still used against \nUkraine, Moldova and Belarus. The Cold War is over, \nbut even the Baltic States have to deal with \nmanipulation of their democratic political landscape \nand neo-colonial games with their minorities. The Cold \nWar is over, but the old Soviet habit of playing on \nethnic and religious hatreds is still alive. That is \nespecially true in the black hole that the North \nCaucasus has become, with brutal violence, \ndisplacement and the killing of hundreds of thousands \nof inhabitants. \n Georgia is responding to these brutal and \ndangerous policies by opening its borders, inviting \npeople to come to engage in exchange, debate and \ndialogue, by trying to overcome the information \nblockades, by trying to rebuild bridges between \nnations \u2014 those essential bridges that others are \nsystematically trying to destroy. Georgia is responding \nto military build-up with programmes to lift children \nout of poverty through access to modern technologies \u2014 \ncomputers, the Internet \u2014 and with new hotels and \nnew boulevards and cycling paths. Georgia is \nresponding to methods of the past by embracing the \n  \n \n11-50871 8 \n \npromises of the future, and many others as well \u2014 new \nhealth-care systems, hundreds of new hospitals, \nadvanced programmes to deal with communicable and \nnon-communicable diseases, and insurance for all. \n The end of the Cold War launched an era of \nopportunity and turbulence, liberating local dynamics \nin ways both tragic and exultant, and leading to a \nconstant flux in the world order. It has unleashed \nhatred, ethnic conflict, mass terror, genocide and many \nother human calamities. But it has also generated \nfantastic emancipations. \n Think of the \u201ccoloured\u201d revolutions in Eastern \nEurope, the dazzling development of Asia, the progress \nof democracy in Africa or, more recently, the Arab \nSpring; none would have been possible if the Soviet \nUnion still existed as a global player and a global \nthreat to all the continents, including Africa, Asia and \nEurope alike. Since 1991, history has become more and \nmore unpredictable, swinging violently between the \nhighest heaven and the deepest abyss that Schelling \nreferred to. Indeed, who could have anticipated the \nglobal consequences of a desperate act by a 26-year-\nold Tunisian, Mohamed Bouazizi, in the remote town \nof Sidi Bouzid? \n One poor man, in an unknown place, was denied \nhis rights by an imperious police and, like a distant \necho of the Czech Jan Palach in front of the Russian \ntanks in 1968, he immolated himself. This breathtaking \nact of despair has literally turned the world upside \ndown. \n Some dictators are jailed or on the run; regimes \nconsidered untouchable have collapsed; new \nconstitutions and orders are being born. An entire \nregion and culture derogatorily labelled as unfit for \ndemocracy by some people in more developed \ncountries has given the whole world, including the \ndeveloped world, a lesson in freedom. \n Such historical eruptions always come as a \nsurprise. They require from us all the radical \nastonishment that Aristotle considered as the very \nbeginning of philosophy, the first step towards true \nwisdom and a radical emancipation from our prejudices \nand dogmas. \n Very few predicted the revolutions that swept \nacross Eastern and Central Europe in 1989, or the \n\u201ccoloured\u201d revolutions that followed 15 years later. \nEven fewer predicted Tunis, Cairo, Benghazi and \nTripoli. The popular call for freedom that has shaken \nthe world in 2011 is the best and most definitive \nanswer to the hatred that motivated the attacks against \nthis very city 10 years ago. \n When aspiring populations are free to live their \nlives, practice their trades, raise their children, voice \ntheir ideas and press their grievances, the space for \nterrorists to recruit or demagogues to sow ethnic hatred \nstarts to evaporate.  \n International police, military and intelligence \ncooperation in the war against Al-Qaida over the past \ndecade have been, and still are, essential in protecting \nour freedoms. I am proud that Georgia has borne more \nthan its share in the international effort in Afghanistan. \nI am proud of our thousands of soldiers who risk \neverything in order to defeat the international \nmovement of hatred \u2014 and I want to pay tribute to \nthose who have died on the battlefield. I am proud of \nour police who are engaged in the struggle against \nnuclear trafficking. I am proud that Georgia has \nbecome a provider, not just a consumer, of \ninternational security. \n I am proud of all of this, but I am also very aware \nthat extremism will not be defeated and terrorism will \nnot be eradicated by military and police means alone. \nTerrorism and extremism can be defeated only if \nfreedom, democracy and prosperity extend their reach \nin the world. \n This is why we welcomed so genuinely the \nefforts of President Obama and President Rousseff in \nlaunching the Open Government Partnership. The \nworld has to respond to the universal call for freedom \nand justice, and only a coordinated response to this call \ncan guarantee our common long-term security. \n Georgia is ready and willing once again to take \non more than its share in this international effort. Our \nexperience of radical post-revolutionary transformation \nover the past eight years could very well be useful for \nthe newly liberated lands.  \n We were not always free. We were a totally failed \nState, a dying economy, a country destroyed by \ncorruption and authoritarian structures. In 2003, a \npeaceful, popular revolution brought to power a young \nteam of reformists. From one day to the next, we were \nin charge of a fragile country in a hostile geopolitical \nenvironment. We discovered quickly that the slogans, \nroses, flags and other tools we used as opposition and \n \n \n9 11-50871 \n \ncivil society leaders would no longer suffice. We \ndiscovered, in fact, that revolutions are not only, and \nnot even mainly, about the crowds gathered in the \nstreets, but that they consist essentially of the long and \ndifficult process of reform that follows the uprising. \n This is the main challenge that Tunisia, Egypt and \nLibya now face. The uplifting images of people \ncelebrating liberation in Tahrir Square, or Libyan \ncitizens dancing in Muammar Al-Qadhafi\u2019s palaces, are \nalready in the past. The success of those revolutions \nwill depend on what happens after the legions of \nreporters from CNN, the BBC and Al-Jazeera have left. \n This is precisely the moment when our Georgian \nexperience \u2014 both successes and shortcomings \u2014 \ncould prove useful. Of course we hardly succeeded in \neverything, and we made many mistakes. But we have \nalso had astonishing results. \n In the aftermath of the Rose Revolution, we fired \n100 per cent of our entire police force. Georgia lived \nfor three months without a single policeman. \nAmazingly, during that period, crime rates went down \ndramatically. Why? Not only because the police were \nresponsible for a large part of our crime rate, but also \nbecause there was a shared feeling that our citizens \nfinally had a stake in their country and that they were \nliving actors in a very specific moment of our nation\u2019s \nhistory \u2014 a moment when everything seemed possible, \nwhen values became the basis of politics and when one \nhad the feeling of inventing one\u2019s own future. This \nfeeling is the true engine of history and our best ally \nagainst extremists. But it is a fragile feeling that has to \nbe nurtured and sustained. \n In Georgia, we have managed to keep this feeling \nalive until now by a permanent process of reform with \nclear benchmarks. Thanks to radical changes in our \npolice force, customs, tax service and bureaucratic \nstructures, and thanks to the widespread feeling among \npeople that they own these transformations, we have \nmade greater progress on Transparency International\u2019s \nCorruption Perceptions Index since 2003 than any \nother State in the world. We are the second or third \nleast corrupt State in Europe, according to the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD) survey. \n We have built a highly favourable investment \nclimate based on efficiency, transparency and the rule \nof law. As a result, we are now ranked as one of the \neasiest places in the world to do business. The World \nBank ranked Georgia, based on five years of records, \nas the world\u2019s number one economic reformer. No \nother country has progressed in that five-year period as \nwe did. We are ranked first in Eastern and Central \nEurope in terms of business, as I said, as one of the \neasiest places in the world. \n The 2011 EBRD survey on countries in transition \nsingles out Georgia as the most successful country in \nour region in terms of institution-building, on par with \ndeveloped European countries.  \n There is still a lot to be done, obviously. We are \nmore committed than ever to pursuing our path of \nreforms and to continuing to build our democracy, even \nas the barrels of hostile tanks point at us just \n40 kilometres away from our capital. \n Of course, the path to efficient democratic \nGovernment is difficult, but it is the only path. Of \ncourse, people will be impatient and disappointed, but \nthere is no alternative to the success of this call for \nfreedom. This is why it is so important to support this \ncall and to deter those who want to suppress it. \n This is why we supported the NATO-led \nintervention in Libya at the initiative of the United \nKingdom, France and the United States. The very fact \nthat the National Transitional Council is now sitting \nhere, in the Hall, and that Al-Qadhafi can no longer \nspeak from this rostrum should give hope for the future \nto all of us. The very fact that this effort was approved \nby the Security Council has shown that that institution \ncan actually be the essential framework for the defence \nof human rights. \n The two anniversaries we are marking \u2014 the \nanniversary of the fall of the Soviet empire and the \nanniversary of 9/11 \u2014 continue to confront us with this \ncentral question: how can we ensure that the new \nspaces that have opened in our world in the past \n20 years thanks to the fall of dictators and thanks to the \nspread of new technologies are filled by peace rather \nthan violence, by tolerance rather than extremism and \nby freedom rather than new forms of enslavement? \n History will judge our generation by how actively \nwe help to answer this question, particularly in a series \nof pivotal arenas, in what people call abusively frozen \nconflicts in and near my own region, in the many \ncountries in the international community that remain \nunder tyranny\u2019s yoke and in the places like those Arab \n  \n \n11-50871 10 \n \nStates that have achieved a new spring of freedom and \nare starting the difficult work of reforms.  \n Wael Ghonim, the young Egyptian Google \nexecutive who helped connect and mobilize so many of \nhis country\u2019s people to stand up for freedom, recently \nsaid that the new revolutions, like the one his country \nexperienced, are a little like Wikipedia: they are grand, \nopen projects to which everyone can contribute. \n The need for participation applies to us as well. \nAs national leaders and as key decision-makers, we can \ncontribute and we must contribute. Let us rise to that \nhistorical imperative. Let us all make our contribution, \nso that, together, we may avoid the deepest abyss and \nstrive instead for the highest heaven."

        "file_text": "I wish at the outset to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-Moon \non his recent reappointment as Secretary-General, and \n  \n \n11-50865 12 \n \nyou, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the \nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly.  \n In this meeting of the United Nations, a \nmultiplicity of countries and ethnicities, cultures and \nlanguages, religions and creeds converges. All are \nincreasingly connected in this globalized world, \nbecause over and above our legitimate differences, we \nall live on the same planet, all breathe the same air and \nare all warmed by the same sun. As inhabitants of \nplanet Earth, we share the same future. We share \nsimilar challenges and opportunities. All of us have the \nsame desire for peace, freedom, justice and prosperity \nfor our peoples and nations. \n I come before the Assembly to express, with \nhumble conviction, what my country has to say to the \ninternational community. But I have also come to \nlisten, carefully and respectfully, to what other \ncountries have to say to our country. Chile is, and will \nalways be, proud to defend and promote dialogue as \nthe best mechanism for dealing with and settling \ndisputes. Chile profoundly believes that all nations, \ncultures, traditions and creeds have something to teach \nus. But we also believe that we all have something to \nlearn from others. \n There is no doubt that we are facing a new \nworld \u2014 very different from the one we, or our \nparents, have known and which emerged forcefully \nduring the past decades: a new world born of the \nrevolutions of knowledge, technology and information \nthat has created, and will continue to create, enormous \nopportunities for material and spiritual progress for \nbillions of people throughout the world \u2014 \nopportunities the world has never known.  \n It is also certain that this new world presents us \nwith new risks, challenges, threats and opportunities \nthat exceed any Government\u2019s individual potential and \ncan only be addressed successfully through joint \naction. For example, financial crises, in addition to \nbecoming more frequent each day, have increasing \nregional and global implications that cannot be \nignored. The evils of modern society, such as terrorism, \ndrug trafficking and organized crime, have for a long \ntime ceased to heed borders, territories or jurisdictions. \nAny attempt to deal effectively with global warming, \nenvironmental protection, natural disasters, health \nemergencies, hunger and extreme poverty will most \ncertainly require greater concerted and effective action \nfrom the community of nations and international \nbodies if we truly want to begin to change the course of \nhistory.  \n Consequently, today it is urgent that we \nreposition ourselves and reshape each international \norganization, many of which emerged in a very \ndifferent world, during the post-war period. Today, as \nwe all know, they lack the ability to provide the \nnecessary effective responses to the realities, \nchallenges and opportunities of the present, as well as \nthose of the future that are beginning to emerge. There \nis no doubt that we have achieved significant progress, \nbut we understand that it has been too slow and \ninsufficient. We cannot pretend to lead this new world \nwith old institutions. One day our children will ask us \nhow to face these challenges. In the end, these are our \nchallenges and we must deal with them now. If we do \nnot, then who will? If not now, then when? \n While it is true that this revolution of knowledge, \ntechnology and information is not the first revolution \nthe world has faced, all of us know that it is the most \nfar-reaching in magnitude and breadth, both in terms \nchallenges and the opportunities it has provided. But \nlike the revolutions of the past \u2014 of metals, agriculture \nor the industrial revolution \u2014 this twenty-first century \nrevolution will be very generous vis-\u00e0-vis the countries \nwith the desire to embrace it enthusiastically. But the \nrevolution will continue to be indifferent, and even \ncruel, to those countries that decide simply to ignore it \nor let it pass by. It will therefore depend on us whether \nit will become a factor for freedom, unity and progress \nand a bridge to span the gap between developed \ncountries and emerging nations or, on the contrary, a \nnew factor of division and a new wall further \nseparating those countries in the world of opportunity \nfrom those in the world of frustrations. \n Certainly, the primary responsibility for rising up \nto greet this revolution that is already knocking at our \ndoors lies with each country. But it is also a \nresponsibility for the international community. In the \ncase of the emerging countries, which include all those \nin Latin America, including my country, Chile, this \nsignifies, in addition to a huge responsibility, a unique \nopportunity to re-identify with our past. Most \nimportant, it is an opportunity to meet up with our \nfuture. It is clear that Latin America \u2014 now \ncelebrating 200 years of independence \u2014 has \neverything it needs to overcome poverty and \nunderdevelopment. We have a large and fertile \nterritory, abundant natural resources, two closely \n \n \n13 11-50865 \n \nrelated languages and, most important, peoples who \nhave demonstrated, with solidarity and vigour, their \nability to overcome any obstacle placed in our way by \nnature or by Providence. We have not had wars such as \nthose experienced by Europe in the past century, or \nethnic or religious conflicts such as those affecting \nother regions of the world.  \n Nevertheless, because we did not know how to \njoin the industrial revolution in time, our continent \nremains underdeveloped, with more than one third of \nits population living in conditions of poverty. However, \nLatin America has learned the lesson and is today \nbecoming integrated with enormous conviction into \nthis new revolution of modern society, science, \ntechnology, knowledge and information. This \nintegration will be successful only if we are able to \npromote and expand what has been, and continues to \nbe, the inexhaustible source of progress for \nhumankind \u2014 freedom. \n Freedom is an integral concept that cannot be \ndivided or compartmentalized. Freedom must be \nexpressed in all spheres of human life. In the political \nsphere, it requires us to revitalize and deepen \ndemocracy and the defence of human rights to the \nfarthest corner of the planet and at any moment in time. \nIn the economic sphere, this means fostering creativity, \nentrepreneurship and innovation among human beings, \nwho are the only truly inexhaustible and renewable \nresource we possess. We must demolish all of the \nobstacles that are preventing many emerging nations \nfrom fully integrating themselves into the newly \nemerging world. In the social sphere, freedom means \npromoting peace and helping States to become ever \nmore efficient and effective in the fight against poverty \nand in the creation of real societies that provide equal \nopportunities for all. \n Chile has undoubtedly made, and will continue to \nmake, important contributions to each of those areas. \nAs well as strongly supporting the cause of democracy \nand defending human rights in all countries of the \ncontinent and of the world, where necessary, Chile has, \nat the regional level, been a tireless and steadfast \nadvocate of improving the Inter-American Democratic \nCharter and of finalizing a protocol on the preventive \nprotection of democracy within the Union of South \nAmerican Nations. \n In addition, we continue to actively participate in \nthe negotiations on the reform of the Security Council \nto increase its permanent and non-permanent members \nin order to make it more representative of the realities \nof the new world order. We have also supported the \nreform of the Human Rights Council, to which Chile \nwas recently re-elected. \n With regard to economic issues, Chile is a \ncountry that has integrated into the world and has \nconcluded free trade agreements with more than 58 \ncountries on all continents, representing more than \n80 per cent of the world\u2019s population. However, our \ncommitment to free trade does not stop there. We have \nbeen strong supporters of the Doha Round of the World \nTrade Organization so as to make progress, once and \nfor all after decades of stagnation, towards the \nliberalization of world trade, because protectionism is a \npoor response and is even worse when we face the \nthreatening crisis conditions that we are experiencing \ntoday.  \n Moreover, with regard to the promotion of world \npeace, Chile has recognized the Palestinian State, a \ncountry that we hope to welcome to the Organization \nvery soon. We have resolutely supported all \ninternational efforts to achieve a just, legitimate and \nlasting settlement in the Middle East. Chile is firmly \nconvinced that the Palestinian people have the right to \na free, sovereign and democratic State and that the \nState of Israel has the right to have recognized, secure \nand respected borders. Only thus will Palestinians and \nIsraelis be able to coexist and move forward in peace \nand harmony.  \n With regard to social development and the fight \nagainst poverty, hunger and pandemics, we are \nstrengthening South-South cooperation. Such \ncooperation is certainly triangular, but it neither \nreplaces nor substitutes the need for North-South \ncooperation. We have set up and are implementing a \nChilean fund to combat hunger and poverty in Africa. \nWe have also made significant contributions to the \nUnited Nations International Drug Purchase Facility in \norder to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, \nwhich still wreak havoc in many parts of the world. \nBut we wish to go even further, and we are \nimplementing mechanisms that will enable us to \nunilaterally reduce duties in order to promote our \nimports from relatively less developed African \ncountries. \n We were also very proud to strongly support \nUN-Women, an entity headed by our compatriot \n  \n \n11-50865 14 \n \nMichelle Bachelet, whose principal goal is as strong \nand as far-reaching as to ultimately ensure that, as \nwomen and men, we have the same rights and the same \nopportunities in this world, which belongs to us all. \n However, in this new century and this new \nknowledge and information society, as well as relying \non robust democracies, with open, competitive and \nintegrated economies, and effective States to combat \npoverty and for greater equality of opportunity, we \nmust recognize that those are merely old pillars that are \nnecessary but completely inadequate today. As \nemerging countries, we must commit to building new \ndevelopment pillars. Those are investment in science \nand technology; the promotion of innovation and \nentrepreneurship; the building of more flexible \nsocieties that can adapt to a world in which change is \nthe only constant; and, above all, making a huge effort \nto improve our human capital, the education of our \nyoung people and the training of our workers, as that is \nsurely the major source of wealth and primary resource \nfor leaving behind underdevelopment.  \n There is no doubt that we must win the race for \ndevelopment and the battle for the future in the \nclassroom by giving each and every one of our children \nquality education. We have said it many times: \neducation is the true mother of all battles. \nUnfortunately, it is also the Achilles heel of many \nemerging economies. In my country in recent weeks, \nthousands of young people have taken to the streets to \ndemonstrate for a noble, great and fine cause, namely, \ngiving all children and young people quality education \nthat enables them all to be actors in, and not mere \nspectators of, their own destiny and participation in \nthis knowledge and information society. \n Our Government has shared, and consistently \nshares, that goal. It is ready for the greatest reforms \nand has committed the largest economic, human, \nprofessional and technical resources in order to bring \nabout fundamental change in our education system that \nseeks to substantially improve the quality of education \nand to increase coverage, in particular in the education \nof children from minorities and the most vulnerable so \nthat they participate in education soon, not when the \nyears have made it irreversible. We must also \nsubstantially increase funding and access at all levels \nof education in order to ensure something as simple as \nquality education for all, free education for all those \nwho need it and adequate funding for all others in \norder to realize the dream that no bright child or young \nperson remains excluded from higher education owing \nto the socio-economic situation of their family or to \nscarce resources.  \n We want to appeal to all Latin American \ncountries, in the context of the Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States, to establish a true \nstrategic partnership that will engage the heart and soul \nof our Governments in that extensive reform of our \neducational systems, which will be our greatest \npossible contribution to the overall development of \npeople to enable them to utilize their talents to the full, \nand to the growth of our economies, while enhancing \npeace and strengthening our democracies.  \n That is why I would also like to mention what the \nPresident of Bolivia said yesterday when he referred to \nhis country\u2019s claim to obtain sovereign access to the \nPacific Ocean through Chilean territory (see \n). In that regard, I wish to reiterate that \nthere are no territorial issues pending between Chile \nand Bolivia. They were settled once and for all by the \nTreaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904, that is to say, \nconcluded more than 100 years ago now. That Treaty \nwas lawfully negotiated more than 20 years after the \nend of the conflict between the two countries. \nMoreover, the parties agreed to it; their Parliaments \nratified it; and, as Bolivia itself acknowledged, the \nTreaty was the outcome of free and consensus-based \nnegotiation. Therefore, in accordance with \ninternational law, both Chile and Bolivia are obliged to \nrespect and implement it in good faith.  \n Chile has fully implemented in a timely way each \nand every clause of that 1904 Treaty of Peace and \nFriendship. Furthermore, the facilities that Chile \ngranted exceeded the Treaty provisions, including \ngoing far beyond those that the United Nations itself \nestablished in the Convention on Transit Trade of \nLand-Locked States. Our country has been, and always \nwill be, willing to engage in dialogue with Bolivia on \nthe basis of full respect for the treaties and \ninternational law. We are sure that, through such \ndialogue, we will have the best possibility of agreeing \nwith Bolivia concrete, feasible and useful solutions for \nboth countries.  \n All of us here have not only the right but the duty \nto speak and act in defence of the interests of our \nrespective countries and peoples. However, we cannot \nfail to note that, for that to be fruitful, requires that we \nwork on the many things that unite us rather than on \n \n \n15 11-50865 \n \nwhat legitimately divides us. When all is said and \ndone, whether we like it or not, responding to the risks \nand the storm clouds that we see looming on the \nhorizon \u2014 but also the challenges and the \nopportunities that we are getting ready to confront, and \nthe responses and the solutions that together we shall \nhave to implement, will only be fruitful and efficient if \nwe do so with unity and goodwill. Some might believe \nthat, acting alone, they will be able to move forward \nfaster, but history will never cease to remind us that it \nis only when we act with unity and goodwill that we \nwill be able to build on solid bedrock and not sand; \nonly that will allow each country \u2014 and the world as a \nwhole \u2014 to go far in fulfilling our tasks, achieving our \ngoals and overcoming our challenges."

        "file_text": "Like others who have \nspoken before me, allow me to add my warm \ncongratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly for our current \nsession. My delegation and I assure him, as always, of \nour support and cooperation. I also wish to thank \nMr. Joseph Diess of Switzerland for a successful term \nas President at the sixty-fifth session. We also \nremember another former President of the Assembly, \nMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, who passed away earlier \nthis year but who left a lasting impact on the good \nwork of the General Assembly and the United Nations. \n As for the ongoing leadership of the \nOrganization, I wish to extend my congratulations to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to \na deserved second term. He and the Secretariat \ncontinue to show the firm resolve needed during these \nchallenging times of global crisis. We pay tribute also \nto the memory of those members of the Secretariat who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of \ninternational duty. \n A further example of the critical role played by \nthe Secretary-General during these difficult times was the \nconvening earlier this week of the High-level Meeting on \nthe prevention and control of non-communicable diseases \n(NCDs). The dangerous potential of NCDs, unchecked \nin small States like mine, threatens not just livelihoods \nand lifestyle but whatever gains may have been \nachieved as they relate to Millennium Development \nGoal (MDG) 6 and the other MDGs. \n At our annual meeting of Pacific Island Forum \nleaders in Auckland earlier this month, we adopted a \nstatement on NCDs in which, among other things, we \ncommitted our Governments to implementing five key \ninterventions in areas known to reduce NCDs: \nControlling tobacco, improving diets, increasing \nphysical activity, reducing alcohol intake and \nfacilitating access to essential drugs and technologies. \n \n \n17 11-51372 \n \n In that respect, Tonga was pleased to join other \nMember States in adopting the Political Declaration \n(resolution 66/2, annex) of the High-level Meeting on \nthe prevention and control of NCDS. I sincerely \nbelieve that the Meeting was a good step in the right \ndirection for setting a healthier and enjoyable future \nfor us all. \n We were pleased that the Secretary-General was \nable to visit a number of countries in our region on his \nway to his historic attendance at the Pacific Islands \nForum. He was able to assess for himself the dominant \nimpact of climate change on countries in the Pacific \nand to validate the activities of Pacific small island \ndeveloping States like Tonga in international forums. \nWe must use the positive foundations laid down \ncollectively in Copenhagen and Canc\u00fan to embrace the \npromise that might lie in Durban at the seventeenth \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change in \nDecember. \n We are pleased that, in July, under the able \npresidency of Germany, the Security Council took solid \nsteps to seize the moral imperative by holding an open \ndebate and producing a presidential statement on the \nMaintenance of international peace and security and \nthe impact of climate change (S/PRST/2011/15*). The \nCouncil and its membership, now and in the future, \nmust not turn from their vigilant duty to keep \nthemselves in a position of leadership over this issue \nand its implications for Member States like Tonga and \nothers in the Pacific. \n While last year\u2019s High-level Meeting on MDGs \noffered small island developing States like Tonga an \nopportunity to take stock of their progress towards \nachieving those Goals in 2015, we consider that we \nhave a similar chance to do so as we all prepare for the \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \nnext year. We stress the critical importance of the \nsustainable development, management and conservation of \nour ocean and marine resources \u2014 living and \nnon-living \u2014 as a proper source of livelihood and \nincome for our communities and Governments. \nEnsuring that States like ours enjoy a greater share of \nthe benefits derived from such resources is key. What \nwe within the Pacific small island developing States \nhave come to refer to as the \u201cblue economy\u201d will be \nour challenge to the Rio Conference to meet the \nexpectations and development aspirations of our \npeoples. \n As such, Tonga continues to observe its \nobligations under the United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea and notes the decision taken by \nconsensus by the States parties this year relating to the \nworkload of the Commission on the Limits of the \nContinental Shelf, whose work is much valued by \ncoastal States such as mine. Tonga, together with \nanother sister State from the region, again actively \nparticipated in the work of the International Seabed \nAuthority this year and noted the decision by the \nAuthority to grant exploration licenses to entities \nsponsored by our respective Governments. This \nrepresents a creative path for States like mine, within \nthe spirit of the Convention, towards solid partnership \nand development. The common heritage of mankind, if \nit is to have any true meaning, ought to be common to \nall and not just to some or the few with the capacity in \nthat area. \n Tonga reiterates its call for the creation and \ndefinition of a formal small island developing States \ncategory within the United Nations system. We are in \nneed of a definition that is not based upon a one-size-\nfits-all approach. Like others, we must have a \ndefinition that separates and addresses those States\u2019 \ndiversity of size, population, remoteness, isolation and \ndifferent levels of socio-economic development. Such a \ndefinition would not only improve linkages within the \nUnited Nations system but also, we believe, set a good \nbenchmark for the international community that is both \ncoherent and practical. It would strengthen the position \nof the United Nations and the international system in \naddressing small island developing States and the \nspecial and unique challenges they face. \n Like others, we, too, welcome the Republic of \nSouth Sudan as our newest State Member of the United \nNations. Tonga has long been supportive of the efforts \nto find a comprehensive, just and enduring peace in the \nMiddle East. The shifting sands of change known as \nthe Arab Spring throughout the surrounding region \nearlier this year has made such a peace and genuine \nsecurity all the more challenging, but not impossible. \nThis is indeed a moment of truth for those with \ngenuine hope, not just for a secure Israel and a viable \nPalestine, but for those who for so long have had such \nhopes for an ambitious peace. \n Tonga\u2019s interest in developing renewable energy \nsources, within the context of our Tonga energy road \nmap, continued to evolve with our election to the \nCouncil of the International Renewable Energy Agency \n  \n \n11-51372 18 \n \n(IRENA) at the first session of the Agency\u2019s Assembly, \nin April 2011. We will work in earnest to ensure that \nthe voices of developing States such as Tonga and \nothers on the new Council are heard, given the key \nleading role it will play in the Agency\u2019s decision-\nmaking and future direction. To take on such a role, \nIRENA must be prepared to be innovative. The \nAgency\u2019s work will take on greater significance in the \ncoming International Year of Sustainable Energy for \nAll and its related activities. I would also like to \nrecognize the strong support of the Government of the \nUnited Arab Emirates as host State for IRENA. \n I am pleased to have addressed the Assembly as \nthe first democratically elected Prime Minister of \nTonga. In the wake of the elections held in November \nof last year, I took office the following month, in \nDecember, after an evolving process of principal \nreforms that, within the context of our 1875 \nConstitution, included the peaceful transfer of \nexecutive power from His Majesty in Privy Council to \nthe Government of the day; a Parliament in which the \nmajority of members are elected by universal suffrage; \na Prime Minister elected by a majority of the elected \nMembers of Parliament; a Cabinet nominated by the \nPrime Minister and chosen largely from those elected \nMembers of Parliament; a constitutional monarchy; \nand a strong and independent judiciary free of political \ninfluence. \n Notwithstanding this peaceful evolution, the \nfundamental freedoms and values guaranteed under the \nConstitution continue to afford legal protection and \ncomforting reassurance to all Tongans. \n To address the uncertain future of the current \nglobal economic and financial climate, my Government \nhas approved the Tonga strategic development \nframework, which provides an overall framework to \nguide the Government\u2019s activities for the next four \nyears. It involves nine priority areas, from building \nstrong, inclusive communities to improving health and \neducation standards for a safe, secure and stable \nTongan society. Earlier this month, my Government \nsigned separate agreements with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank to improve \ninformation and communications technology services \nfor Tonga so as to make them affordable and \naccessible. Improving such services will enable Tonga \nto enhance its related education, health and \nGovernment services as well. My Government \nsincerely believes that this framework will put Tonga \non a firm path to improving its ability to meaningfully \nachieve the United Nations Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015. \n As such, in closing my Government happily \nreaffirms its commitment to the principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations, and we pledge to \nsupport the ongoing work and reform of the \nOrganization."

        "file_text": "It is a great \npleasure for me to be back at the United Nations \nHeadquarters. Last February I had the honour of taking \npart in a Security Council meeting, where I took the \nopportunity to thank the permanent members and all \n  \n \n11-51197 12 \n \nother nations that have been part of the Council for the \ngenerosity and care that have always been present in \nthe resolutions on Timor-Leste. Today, on behalf of the \npeople of Timor-Leste, I want to take this opportunity \nto thank all Members of this forum for the support they \nhave given to Timor-Leste in the promotion of peace \nand security and in the building of our national \ninstitutions. I am pleased to inform the General \nAssembly that we have come a long way as a people \nand as a State, replacing intolerance with constructive \ndialogue and the right to protest with the duty to \nprotest responsibly. We have taken firm steps to put the \ndifficult circumstances of the past behind us, and we \nhave renewed the confidence of the Timorese people in \nthe institutions of the State. As such we have already \nendorsed the Joint Transition Plan for the withdrawal \nof the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-\nLeste by the end of 2012. \n We are in the last year of the five-year mandate \nof the Coalition Government that I have the honour of \nleading \u2014 the Parliamentary Majority Alliance (AMP), \nwhich includes five different political parties. Under \nthe Constitution of Timor-Leste the Government is \ndetermined either by the party with the most elected \nrepresentatives or by an alliance of parties with a \nparliamentary majority, as it is our National Parliament \nthat is elected directly by the people and not the \nGovernment itself. A government can be constituted \nonly if it is supported by a parliamentary majority. \nFollowing the 2007 elections the party with the most \nparliamentary representatives did not have a majority \nin its own right, so the President of the Republic, after \nformally meeting with all parties, endorsed a coalition \ngovernment in order to provide the best opportunity for \nstable government. This constitutional option served \nthe best interests of the nation, as we were living in a \nperiod of great fragility at that time as demonstrated by \nthe instability and violence that were the consequences \nof the 2006 crisis. \n Having inherited an unstable national situation, \nthe AMP Government focused on restoring peace and \nstability and resolving the many social and political \nproblems that stemmed from the 2006 crisis and \ncontinued into 2008. We were determined to put an end \nto the violent outbreaks that began in 2000 and were \nrepeated every two years, as though Timor-Leste was \ntrapped in a vicious cycle of violence. The key to \nbreaking the cycle was to acknowledge and admit that \nwe had failed. We had to address the root causes of our \nproblems and learn to deal with the frailty of our State \ninstitutions. Fortunately we were successful in \nconveying a strong political message about the need \nfor stability. The AMP Government committed itself to \na reform agenda and by governing through dialogue \nwas able to: initiate vital reforms in the defence and \nsecurity sectors, including capacity-building and \nprofessionalizing the police and defence forces; \nimplement structural reforms in the State \nAdministration\u2019s management; create systems and \nstructures to ensure good governance, while continuing \nto support capacity-building in the justice sector; \nintroduce fairer social policies to reduce the imbalance \nthat existed in the society, taking into account the \nphysical, moral and psychological damage of a 24-year-\nlong war, and here I am speaking about veterans and \nthe elderly, who sacrificed themselves for our \nindependence and who, directly or indirectly, have \nsuffered the consequences of a devastating war; \nencourage structured policies on education, health and \nagriculture; and promote a coherent economic policy \nthroughout Timor-Leste to encourage the fledgling \nprivate sector. \n In 2009, on the tenth anniversary of the \nreferendum, the Government launched a new motto: \n\u201cGoodbye conflict, welcome development\u201d. The people \nof Timor-Leste embraced this motto wholeheartedly. In \nlooking forward to the period 2011-2020 we are \nconfident that we are now truly becoming a more \nstable and tolerant society that is peaceful by nature. \nWe also have the necessary optimism to initiate a \nbolder period of development. \n Over the past four years we have been \nstrengthening the institutional capacity of our public \nadministration to defend the best interests of the State, \nimprove public-service delivery, and promote good \ngovernance. \n We have introduced reforms in the area of public \nfinance management and we have created a Civil Service \nCommission. We have also created an Anti-Corruption \nCommission and begun to establish a Chamber of \nAccounts to promote transparency and accountability \nin our public accounts. Earlier this year we launched an \non-line transparency portal and procurement portal \nproviding access to data that is updated daily and that \ndeals with the process of the Timor-Leste State general \nbudget and its execution. These portals also allow \npublic consultation on advertised public projects. \n \n \n13 11-51197 \n \n We have also begun to develop the capacity of \nour private sector by promoting competence, \nprofessional honesty and technical skills. Our aim is to \ntransform the private sector into a strong partner with \nGovernment at this crucial period when we are \nbuilding our country. Across the country we have \ninvested in agriculture to increase the productivity of \nthe sector, as well as local and decentralized \ndevelopment programmes focused on minor \ninfrastructure projects to promote employment for \nyoung people in rural areas. Such measures have \ncontributed to our economic growth and helped create \njobs in the capital, Dili, and in rural areas, and they \nhave encouraged confidence in our State institutions \nand led to a spirit of optimism that has contributed to a \nchange in mindset. \n Timor-Leste is a country blessed with great \nnatural wealth, which means that we have the financial \ncapacity to improve the living conditions of our people. \nHowever, we know that countries rich in natural \nresources often perform below their economic potential \nand are more vulnerable to conflict and more \nsusceptible to bad governance. As such, transparency \nand good governance, which are essential in any \ncountry, become even more imperative for countries \nthat are rich in natural resources. Currently, the \nPetroleum Fund of Timor-Leste has a balance of \n$8.9 billion. We are the first country in Asia and the \nthird in the world to be compliant with the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative. As a result of our \ngood governance and prudent use of revenue, Timor-\nLeste has had double-digit growth in the past few \nyears. We believe that we are on the path to maintain \nthis growth, and we are confident that the institutions \nwe have established to support the Fund will become \nstronger, ensuring responsiveness and greater quality \nof work and execution. We will diversify the \ninvestment of our Petroleum Fund equally in bonds and \nequities to guarantee long-term sustainability, so that \nfuture generations will benefit in the same way as the \ncurrent post-war generation.  \n Having achieved our goal of stability we were in \na position to prepare a 20-year strategic development \nplan, which would replace the annual plan for each \nfiscal year. The plan covers three vital areas \u2014 social \ncapital, infrastructure and economic development. In \nterms of economic development we are focused on \nthree strategic industry sectors \u2014 the hydrocarbon \nindustry, the agriculture sector and tourism. We want to \nshift from an oil-dependent economy to a non-oil-\ndependent economy. All the strategies and actions set \nout in the plan aim to transform Timor-Leste from a \nlow-income country to an upper middle-income \ncountry with a healthy, well-educated and safe \npopulation that is prosperous and self-sufficient in \nterms of food. This new paradigm requires public \ninvestment in infrastructure and services and a \ndynamic private sector. Many emerging economies, \nparticularly in the Asian region, have been growing \ndespite the serious international financial crisis. \n Next year will be very important for us to \nconsolidate our process of State-building and to affirm \nourselves as a sovereign, tolerant and democratic \nnation. In 2012 we will hold presidential and \nlegislative elections, the third democratic elections in \nTimor-Leste, which I am confident will be conducted \npeacefully. Next year we will also celebrate vital \nhistoric dates that connect us to the more recent past, \nnamely, the struggle for independence, and to older \nroots that make us unique within the region and the \nworld. \n In addition to celebrating the tenth anniversary of \nthe restoration of independence, in 2012 we will also \ncelebrate the centenary of the Manufahi Revolt and the \n500-year anniversary of the arrival of the first \nPortuguese navigators in Timor-Leste. I should like to \ntake this opportunity to invite all to take part in these \ncelebrations, in the same spirit of thanks and solidarity \nas the invitation that we extended to our independence \ncelebrations in 2002. We were not alone on that \nimportant date, and we continue to benefit from the \ngenerosity and support of nations throughout the \nworld. We are pleased to continue to strengthen and to \nexpand our ties of solidarity with friendly countries \nfrom various continents with different stories, different \nbeliefs and different ethnicities.  \n We are trying to be more active in our region and \nin the world, showing that it is possible to leave \nbehind, or to close, a period of conflict, even a long \nperiod, and to focus our energy on humanist ideals of \npolitical and social tolerance for the dignity and \ndevelopment of all. That is why we are intent on \njoining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \nTimor-Leste desires peace and shares the spirit of \ncooperation that led to the creation of that regional \norganization. We are also continuing to build upon our \nrelationships with our friends in Asia and the Pacific, \n  \n \n11-51197 14 \n \nincluding China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and \nNew Zealand, among others.  \n Timor-Leste is strongly committed as well to its \nmembership in the Community of Portuguese-speaking \nCountries which consists of nations and peoples from \nthe four corners of the world. We are observers in the \nPacific Islands Forum and we have a good relationship \nwith the European Union, which provides significant \nsupport and assistance. Next week I will make an \nofficial visit to Portugal, which shares ties with Timor-\nLeste that go back hundreds of years. Despite being in \none of the worst economic and financial crises in its \nhistory, exacerbated by the global and European \nfinancial crisis, Portugal remains a steadfast partner of \nTimor-Leste and has strengthened its bilateral \ncooperation in several areas. The first Timorese \nmilitary personnel are being trained in Portugal and \nwill be integrated into the Portuguese contingent that \nwill participate in the peacekeeping mission in \nLebanon under the United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon. \n Timor-Leste is one of the 50 States classified as a \nleast developed country (LDC). We are also called a \nfragile State. That classification stems from \ninstitutional, political, economic, social and other \nfactors. In April last year we had the honour to host an \ninternational dialogue in Dili on the subject of \u201cPeace-\nbuilding and State-building\u201d with the participation of \nLDCs from the group we call the Group of Seven Plus \n(g7+), which is at present chaired by Timor-Leste. This \ngroup is a forum that allows fragile and post-conflict \ncountries to come together and talk about themselves, \nlearn from each other\u2019s experiences and create new \npossibilities for facing the future with determination \nand optimism. The g7+ consists of 17 member \ncountries covering around 350 million people from \nAfrica, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The g7+ \nalso aims to improve the transparency and efficiency of \ninternational aid. The group is a mechanism for \ndialogue with each other and with the international \ncommunity about aid programmes and aid \neffectiveness. It should also be noted that fragile States \nrequire a period of transition with greater flexibility in \ndonor funding, instead of a policy of one size fits all, \nwhich can only interfere with the individual processes \nof each country. \n A high-level forum on development assistance is \nscheduled to take place next November in Pusan, South \nKorea. In that forum we will evaluate progress made in \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and will \nalso set new action frameworks. Under-developed \ncountries focus on meeting Millennium Development \nGoals every day, although it will be very difficult to \nmeet them by 2015. These countries face daily \nchallenges and difficulties in pursuing objectives to \ncombat poor administration and reduce poverty. \nDemocracy is a process and not an end in itself. Most \nof these countries are young democracies and have the \narduous task of changing the mindset of their people \nscarred by conflict. They must also deal with internal \nand external pressures that prevent them from paying \ntoo much attention to a series of universal criteria that \nare too idealized or standardized and not adjusted to \nthe actual situation of those countries. Understanding \nthe specific circumstances of each developing country \nand motivating the people to cultivate a spirit of hope \nand belonging will surely yield more results than \nforcing situations where receiving countries cannot \nimmediately meet the conditions imposed on them, \nthereby being put in a situation of moral, \npsychological, political and financial dependency, \nwhich does little to help them move towards \ndevelopment.  \n It is in that context of balanced and sustained \ndevelopment that I raise the issue of aid effectiveness. \nPoor countries also need a message of confidence, \nsince all they hear about is transparency and \naccountability. Still, the international economic \nrecession proves that the lessons taught by those with \nall the power, the knowledge and the money may not \nalways be the best. Therefore, I believe that we must \nall \u2014 poor countries and donor countries \u2014 change \nour attitudes. The United Nations has a vital role to \nplay here in terms of correcting and adjusting aid to \nactual and local realities.  \n We remain divided into North and South, into \nrich and poor, into Westerners and Arabs, into Asians \nand Africans, into Muslims and non-Muslims, and into \nChristians and non-Christians. Even today many of the \npeople who hold or influence power still have a Cold \nWar mentality. We need a new world order that is also \npolitical and economic, where conflicts and discord are \nreplaced by dialogue, where democracy is used to give \nvoice to the weak and vulnerable and where aid and \nsolidarity are used appropriately to mitigate the \nsuffering of the people. We have to give voice to the \npeoples of the world and listen to their aspirations. \nOnly through dialogue can we fight violence, which \n \n \n15 11-51197 \n \ncauses all kinds of misery. Only through peaceful \nsolutions can we prevent the massive destruction \ncaused by war.  \n The people of Timor-Leste, who have \nexperienced the pain caused by destruction and \nviolence, hope that their brothers and sisters \nthroughout the world who are suffering today because \nof conflicts may find peace. However, as everyone \nsays, peace is not only the absence of war, true peace \ncomes from within, the peace of spirit. Therefore, I \nappeal to the United States of America to demonstrate \ngreatness of spirit and humanism and eliminate the \nCuban embargo that has existed for more than \n25 years. \n Lastly, in 1991 I was still in the mountains \nleading the resistance when the Western Sahara \nreferendum was first proposed. I was in prison in 1995 \nwhen Yasser Arafat, Shimon Perez and Yitzak Rabin \nreceived the Nobel Peace Prize. Two Timor-Leste \ncitizens also received the Nobel Peace Prize, and \nIndonesia accepted the referendum result, just as North \nSudan did. \n We hope that the people of Western Sahara and \nPalestine can find more viable, fair and realistic ways \nthrough mechanisms that will lead them effectively to \nthe resolution of their conflicts, which, sadly, are \nbecoming the oldest conflicts in the world. We all need \nto reform our mindsets, attitudes and institutions. We \nall must start these reforms within our own nations, but \nI should like to suggest a common challenge here, that \nthese reforms begin right here in this building at the \nheadquarters of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "\nDuring the past year we have witnessed events and \npopular uprisings that are changing the face of the \nplanet, both politically and economically. As President \nof a country that firmly believes in multilateralism, I \ncome to the General Assembly today to emphasize how \nimportant it is for the United Nations to assume the \nfundamental role that belongs to it in the face of such \ncrises. Crises in and of themselves are neither good nor \nbad; their results depend on how we manage them. \nThey can often become genuine opportunities.  \n The political transformations we are seeing in \nNorth Africa and in the Middle East, for example, if \nthey lead to a strengthening of democracy and the rule \nof law in the affected countries, can be a factor in \nglobal stability. What the peoples request, what the \npeoples seek, is freedom, respect for their rights, the \nability to choose their leaders and democracy. The duty \nof the international community is to support them. If \nwe do not, if we turn our back on them, we may see a \nprotracted period of civil wars and conflict, which we \nshould avoid at all cost. \n Therefore, we must commit ourselves to \nstrengthening and applying the methods of peaceful \nconflict resolution described in Chapter VI of the \nUnited Nations Charter. The more efficient we are in \nthe use of preventive diplomacy, the less need there \nwill be for intervention.  \n We should advocate effective mediation with \nconviction, mediation that does not seek the leading \nrole but one that is given the time and tools required to \nestablish trust and to reach solutions that are \nadvantageous to all parties. \n I am pleased to be able to affirm today that \nColombia does not just believe in mediation and \npeaceful solutions; we have successfully put them into \npractice. My Government succeeded in normalizing \nrelations with two countries: Venezuela and Ecuador. \nWe did this on the basis of conciliation and respectful, \ndirect dialogue. \n The former President of Argentina, Mr. N\u00e9stor \nKirchner, then Secretary General of the Union of South \nAmerican Nations, lent his good offices to the \nrapprochement between Venezuela and Colombia. His \nmanagement was extremely effective, a great legacy he \nleft to our region. \n In Latin America we have learned that \nGovernments and States may have differing, even at \ntimes opposing, political concepts, but that this does \nnot mean they cannot live together and cooperate in \npeace. We have also made important contributions to \nthe search for dialogue, negotiation and mediation in \nour region. Honduras is an example of that effort. \nVenezuela and Colombia joined forces to support the \nHonduran parties in their reconciliation through \ndialogue and rebuilding trust. This succeeded in \nbringing Honduras back into the Union of South \nAmerican Nations. \n What I have said so far can also be applied to \nlong-standing conflicts, such as that between Israel and \nPalestine. Advances can be achieved if, and only if, \ndirect dialogue and effective mediation are employed. \nAlong with the rest of the international community, we \nare concerned by the suspension of peace negotiations, \nand we urge \u2014 in fact, we implore \u2014 both parties to \nreturn to the negotiating table as soon as possible. That \nis the only \u2014 I repeat, the only \u2014 path that leads to \nwhat we all wish to see: two States living in peace and \nsecurity. \n  \n \n11-50692 42 \n \n On a positive note, we can offer as an example of \nappropriate cooperation and negotiation the efforts that \nled to the creation of the Republic of South Sudan, the \nmost recent Member of the United Nations, to which \nwe give the most effusive welcome. \n As a current member of the Security Council, \nColombia has brought to the agenda the situation of \nHaiti, a country struck by natural phenomena and \naffected by unacceptable poverty. The solution there \nmust remain a priority for all of us. Peace in Haiti will \nbe the fruit not just of peacekeeping operations, but of \nthe empowerment of Haitians themselves in handling \ntheir own problems and solutions, with sufficient \ninternational support for their economic and social \ndevelopment. \n By virtue of its place as the country with the \ngreatest biodiversity per square kilometre in the world, \nwhich makes it highly vulnerable, Colombia is \ncommitted to measures that mitigate the effects of \nclimate change and enable us to adapt to them. \n We are participating in the preparations for the \nupcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, Rio+20, which will take place in July \n2012, with a proposal we have been developing in \nconsultation with other countries. We believe that one \nof the main results of Rio+20 should be the \nestablishment of a set of sustainable development goals \nbased on the agenda that was approved in the first \nconference and echoing the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n The guiding principles were established in Rio in \n1992, and an implementation plan was agreed on in \nJohannesburg in 2002. Today, 20 years later, we need \nto define a set of goals that allow us to measure \nachievements, identify shortcomings and determine the \nopportunities for advancement. The planet and its \nfuture demand that we work with goals, with specific \nindicators of results that ensure the efficacy of our \nefforts. \n A year ago I said that thanks to advances in \neconomic and social security, Colombia was at the \nthreshold of a new dawn. Today I can state with \nrealism and well-founded optimism that the first rays \nof that new dawn are beginning to warm us and light \nour way. \n My Government is one of national unity, in which \nthe main political parties have converged around the \nfundamental objectives of the nation. This unity has \nafforded us a significant measure of governability and \nhas enabled us to have historic laws and reforms \napproved in our Congress that will help us to have a \nmore prosperous and safer nation, one that is more \nequitable and more egalitarian. \n Among the initiatives that have been approved, I \nwish to point to a law concerning victims and the \nreturn of land that guarantees that the State and society \nwork to make reparations and to return stolen lands to \nhundreds of thousands of farmers affected by the \nviolence of the past several decades. We are paying a \nmoral debt to the victims. This is the first time in the \nhistory of the world that this is happening before the \nend of an internal armed conflict. We have decided that \njustice, truth and reparations must not have to wait.  \n It is worth pointing out that Secretary-General \nBan-Ki Moon joined us in Bogot\u00e1 the day that law was \npassed. He emphasized the advance it represented and \noffered the assistance of the United Nations in ensuring \nits proper application.  \n Also thanks to the governability guaranteed by \nour new national unity, we were able to establish a \nmore equitable distribution of resources originating \nfrom oil and mining to ensure that they reach our \nneediest population and regions. \n In addition, at this time of global financial and \neconomic volatility, we have introduced into our \nConstitution the element of fiscal sustainability, and \nhave enacted a law to ensure that the State maintains \ndiscipline in its management of public finances. Such \nresponsible initiatives have increased investor \nconfidence, had a positive impact on our country\u2019s risk \nrating and will lead to a more stable economic future in \nwhich we believe we will be able to focus on reducing \nunemployment and poverty, my Government\u2019s two \nmain priorities. \n Colombia, to a degree unlike any other country in \nthe world, has had to deal with the global drug \nproblem. We have had much success, but a great many \nchallenges remain. We know how terrorists benefit \nfrom drug-trafficking, and there can be no doubt that \ndrugs and terrorism threaten democracies and the rule \nof law. Colombia will continue to combat these \nscourges, because for us they represent a national \nsecurity problem. We are actively cooperating in the \nregion, and will continue to do so, to combat \ntransnational crime. We can only succeed if we \n \n \n43 11-50692 \n \ncooperate and work together in this struggle, which \naffects every country equally. \n A year ago, from this rostrum (see A/65/PV.15), I \nsaid that we should call the decade that was then just \nbeginning the decade of Latin America and the \nCaribbean. I reaffirm that prediction now. Our region is \nan area of political and economic stability that is firmly \ndetermined to move forward with social policy. We \nhave both the capability and the willingness to provide \nthe world with solutions in the areas of the \nenvironment, water, energy, food and labour. But our \nregion cannot grow or progress in isolation. We want to \nadvance hand in hand with the world, sharing the \nprinciples of respect and tolerance. We welcome \nprogress in prosperity wherever it occurs in the world. \n That is why I would like to conclude by calling \non the nations of the world and on the Organization \nthat brings us together here to continue to work \ntogether to make use of the peaceful means at our \ndisposal, with a new goal: to turn the crises we are \nexperiencing today into opportunities for a better \ntomorrow. The future, as has always been the case, \ndepends on us. With determination and positive \nleadership, we can convert these storms into winds \nfavourable to the whole of humankind."

        "file_text": "Seldom has \npeople\u2019s yearning for freedom, dignity and self-\ndetermination played such a dominant role as it has this \nyear. Until now, we have experienced globalization \n \n \n49 11-51384 \n \nfirst and foremost through the ever-greater integration \nof the world economy. Today, we see that globalization \nmeans so much more; that it has also brought about a \nglobalization of values. Those are the values enshrined \nin the United Nations Charter, the inalienable rights \ncontained in the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. \n In North Africa and in the Arab world, millions of \npeople have shaken off the shackles of decades of \noppression. They want freedom, democracy and human \nrights, as well as better lives for themselves and their \nfamilies. That road is anything but easy. A new \npolitical system must mature in order to become stable. \nThat takes time and patience. However, even the \nlongest road begins with the very first step. This is a \nyear of momentous steps. \n We have not forgotten the moving images of \npeople who won dignity and self-respect by their own \nefforts, the proud faces on Bourguiba Boulevard in \nTunis and in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Those people want \nto shape their own future, and their yearning is by no \nmeans limited to the Arab world. In Belarus, too, \npeople long for an end to repression and tyranny and \nfor the opportunity to fully develop their individual \npersonalities. \n With the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification \nmore than 20 years ago, Germany experienced for \nitself the joy of a peaceful revolution. Today we have a \nfundamental interest in the success of the political \nawakening in the southern Mediterranean region. We \nGermans offer our support for the reforms in Morocco \nand Jordan, the political awakening in Egypt and \nTunisia, and the fresh start in Libya following the \noverthrow of the dictator. \n Every country and every society will find its own \nway into the modern world, either through revolution \nor through reform. We want to provide advice and \nsupport. We want to help create an independent \njudiciary, a pluralistic media landscape, and a vibrant \ncivil society. We want to help people come to terms \nwith their past and we want to support the \nconstitutional process. Above all, however, we want to \nassist in the crucial process of building a new social \nand economic order, for we all know that the success of \nsocial change largely hinges on economic success. \nPeople who take to the streets for freedom and self-\ndetermination must see first-hand that they, too, can \nsucceed with the help of their ideas, their creativity and \ntheir commitment. \n Germany is therefore working not only for close \npartnerships but for increased market access. We want \nto foster change through increased trade. We are \noffering investments, especially in the small and \nmedium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of an \nopen and successful society. Most important of all, \nhowever, will be to offer young people education and \ntraining so that they can make the most of their \nopportunities. That is of key importance to successful \ntransitions and fresh starts in those countries. \n The courageous men and women of Syria deserve \na clear sign of our solidarity. The Syrian Government \nhas responded to the legitimate demands of the Syrian \npeople with brutal force. Germany will continue to \npress for a Security Council resolution. This is not only \nabout showing solidarity with the Syrian people; it is \nalso about the credibility of the international \ncommunity. If the repression continues, we Europeans \nwill further tighten sanctions against the regime. The \nSyrian people should be free to shape their own future. \n This week has been dominated by the unresolved \nconflict in the Middle East. On Friday here in New \nYork, President Abbas expressed the Palestinians\u2019 \nexpectations and understandable frustration with the \nlack of progress made (see ). On the same \nday, Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel\u2019s \njustified desire to exist in peace within secure borders \n(see ). Both sides have legitimate interests. \nHowever, these interests are certainly not \nirreconcilable. They can be overcome if the parties \ninvolved are willing to do so. \n Germany is backing a two-State solution. We \nsupport a Palestinian State that will allow the \nPalestinians to live in dignity and self-determination \nand that is independent, sovereign, contiguous and \ndemocratic, as well as politically and economically \nviable. Over the past few years, we have been heavily \ninvolved in the practical development of this statehood \nby helping to build an administration, infrastructure \nand vocational training, as well as politically, in the \nGerman-Palestinian Steering Committee. And we do \nnot want that State to be founded sometime in the \ndistant and indeterminate future. \n Let there be no doubt, however, that the security \nof Israel is and will continue to be part of the raison \nd\u2019\u00eatre of the Federal Republic of Germany. Peace \n  \n \n11-51384 50 \n \nbetween Israelis and Palestinians is possible. A \nPalestinian State is possible. Two States existing \npeacefully side by side are possible. However, they can \nbe achieved only through negotiations. The statement \nissued by the Middle East Quartet on Friday identified \nthe milestones along the way. Germany worked hard \nfor that Quartet statement and staunchly supports it. \n The confrontation of words here in New York \nmust not be allowed to lead to an escalation in violence \nin the Middle East. I therefore call on both sides, \nPalestinians and Israelis, to enter into direct \nnegotiations without delay. On Friday, the two sides \nreaffirmed their desire for a negotiated peace. The task \nnow is to channel the energy and pressure of recent \ndays into a constructive process. The two sides have \nbeen called on to come forward within three months \nwith comprehensive proposals on territory and security, \nand to refrain from all provocative actions. The \ninternational community will continue to support the \ndifficult road to peace. This includes the Moscow \nconference as part of the negotiating timetable for the \ncoming months. \n I would like to express my appreciation to all \nwho have worked so hard in the past few days to create \nthis opportunity for a constructive solution. As a \nEuropean, I would like to extend my special thanks to \nthe European Union\u2019s High Representative, Lady \nAshton. Let us make use of the impetus provided by \nthe intensive efforts here in New York for the benefit of \nthe people of Israel and the Palestinian territories. \n The international community has worked \ntirelessly for years to ensure that Afghanistan ceases to \nharbour a threat to international peace and security. \nMany, indeed too many people have already lost their \nlives as a result of that threat. On 5 December in Bonn, \nunder Afghanistan\u2019s chairmanship, we will discuss the \nway forward. The Conference will focus on three major \nissues. The first is the complete handover of \nresponsibility for security. This summer saw the start \nof a process whereby the Afghans are to gradually \nassume responsibility for security in their country by \n2014. This is a responsible handover of responsibility. \n Secondly, the international community will \nremain engaged in Afghanistan after 2014. Afghanistan \nwill continue to need economic initiatives and more \nregional cooperation to help strengthen its sovereignty. \nThe New Silk Road initiative, which we launched here \nin New York last week, is intended to serve this aim.  \n Thirdly, Afghanistan\u2019s internal reconciliation and \nsupport from States in the region are critical to lasting \npeace. The brutal murder of former President Rabbani \nshows that the reconciliation process will continue to \nsuffer setbacks. Nevertheless, it must and will go on. \nGermany will play its part on the road to Bonn. \n While people are seizing the opportunity to build \na better future for themselves in freedom and self-\ndetermination in a growing number of countries around \nthe world, millions in the Horn of Africa are struggling \nto survive. The United Nations has played a valuable \nrole in providing swift humanitarian assistance. \nGermany is doing everything in its power in this and \nmany other crises to alleviate the suffering. \n The collapse of State authority and the impact of \nclimate change are aggravating the already disastrous \nsituation. Germany will continue to be in the vanguard \nof the fight against climate change. As with \ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, as well as \nthe protection of human rights, the fight against \nclimate change is an integral element of preventive \ndiplomacy. It is part of a farsighted peace policy. \n By the end of this year, our planet will have more \nthan 7 billion inhabitants. In that world, Germany will \nplace its hopes in a strong United Nations as a forum \nfor political consensus-building, a source of rules with \ninternational legitimacy, and a player in the crisis \nregions of this world. The United Nations Charter and \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights offer more \npeople than ever before the direction and inspiration \nthey need to strive for a cooperative world order and a \nfairer global community. \n However, the United Nations has to adapt to our \nchanging world. Only then will the decisions made \nhere gain political force, effectiveness and acceptance. \nNew centres of power are emerging in global politics. \nTheir economic dynamism has prompted them to \ndemand political participation. The sixty-fifth session \nof the General Assembly considered United Nations \nreform, but no real progress has been achieved so far. \nWe welcome the fact that the new President intends to \nagain personally champion this reform. We will do \neverything we can to him. \n In September 38 years ago, two German States \nwere admitted to the United Nations. At that time, my \npredecessor in office, Walter Scheel, stated before the \nAssembly: \n \n \n51 11-51384 \n \n \u201cWhere there is a question of international \ncooperation, of preserving peace and of \nprotecting the rights of man, there the Federal \nRepublic of Germany will always be found. If \nthere is anything we have learned from our own \nbitter experience it is this: man is the measure of \nall things\u201d. \n Man is the measure of all things. Germany \nremains committed to this principle."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on your \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nfor this session. I wish you every success. \n Today, on behalf of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (PLO) and the Palestinian people, I \nextend my sincere congratulations to the Government \nand the people of South Sudan on their deserved \nadmission as a full Member of the United Nations. We \nwish them progress and prosperity. \n I also congratulate the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, on his election for a new term at the \nhelm of the United Nations. This renewal of trust \nreflects the world\u2019s appreciation for his efforts, which \nhave strengthened the role of the Organization. \n The question of Palestine is intricately linked \nwith the United Nations through the resolutions \nadopted by its various organs and agencies and through \nthe essential and lauded role of the United Nations \nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \nNear East (UNRWA). UNRWA embodies the \ninternational responsibility with regard to the plight of \nPalestine\u2019s refugees, who are the victims of Al-Nakba, \nthe catastrophe that occurred in 1948.  \n We aspire to and seek a greater and more \neffective role for the United Nations in working to \nachieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region, \none that ensures the inalienable, legitimate national \nrights of the Palestinian people as defined by the \nresolutions of international legitimacy and as embodied \nby the United Nations. \n A year ago, on this same occasion and in this \nsame Hall, many leaders and heads of delegations \naddressed the stalled peace efforts in our region. \nEveryone had high hopes for a new round of final \nstatus negotiations, which had begun in early \nSeptember in Washington under the direct auspices of \nPresident Obama and with participation of the Quartet, \nEgypt and Jordan, to reach a peace agreement within \none year. We entered those negotiations with open \nhearts and attentive ears and sincere intentions. We \nwere ready with our documents, files, papers and \nproposals. But the negotiations broke down just weeks \nafter they were launched. \n After that, we did not give up and did not cease \nour efforts to craft initiatives and make contacts. Over \nthe past year, we did not leave a door to be knocked on \nor a channel to be tested or a path to be taken. We did \nnot ignore any formal or informal party of influence \nand stature that could be addressed. We considered \npositively the various ideas and proposals and \ninitiatives presented by many countries and parties. But \nall of those sincere efforts and endeavours by \ninternational parties were repeatedly smashed against \nthe rocks of the positions of the Israeli Government, \nwhich quickly dashed the hopes raised by the launch of \nnegotiations last September. \n The core issue here is that the Israeli Government \nrefuses to commit to terms of reference for the \nnegotiations that are based on international law and \nUnited Nations resolutions, and that it frantically \ncontinues to intensify the building of settlements on the \nterritory of the future State of Palestine. \n Settlement activities embody the core of the \npolicy of colonial military occupation of the land of the \nPalestinian people and all of the brutality, aggression \nand racial discrimination against our people that that \npolicy entails. The policy constitutes a breach of \ninternational humanitarian law and United Nations \n  \n \n11-51185 26 \n \nresolutions. It is the primary cause of the failure of the \npeace process, the collapse of dozens of opportunities \nand the burial of the great hopes that arose from the \nsigning of the Declaration of Principles in 1993 \nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and \nIsrael to achieve a just peace that would begin a new \nera for our region. \n Reports by United Nations missions and by \nseveral Israeli civil institutions and societies convey a \nhorrific picture of the size of the settlement campaign, \nwhich the Israeli Government does not hesitate to boast \nabout and which it continues to execute through the \nsystematic confiscation of Palestinian lands. It invites \ntenders for the construction of thousands of new \nsettlement units in various areas of the West Bank, \nparticularly in the Arab parts of Jerusalem. It \naccelerates construction of the apartheid separation \nWall that is eating up large tracts of our land, dividing \nit into separate and isolated islands, destroying family \nlife and communities and harming the livelihoods of \ntens of thousands of Palestinian families.  \n The occupying Power also continues to refuse to \nissue permits for our people to build in occupied East \nJerusalem. At the same time, it intensifies its decades-\nlong campaign of demolition and confiscation of \nhomes, displacing Palestinian owners and residents \nunder a multipronged policy of ethnic cleansing aimed \nat pushing Palestinians away from their ancestral \nhomeland. Moreover, matters have reached the point \nwhere orders have been issued to deport elected \nrepresentatives from their city of Jerusalem.  \n The occupying Power also continues to undertake \nexcavations that threaten our Holy Places, and its \nmilitary checkpoints prevent our citizens from gaining \naccess to their mosques and churches. It continues to \nbesiege the Holy City with a ring of settlements and a \nseparation Wall imposed to separate the Holy City from \nthe rest of the cities of Palestine. The occupation is \nracing against time to redraw the borders on our land \naccording to what it wants and to impose a fait \naccompli on the ground that changes its realities and \nfeatures and that is undermining the realistic potential \nfor the establishment of the State of Palestine. \n At the same time, the occupying Power continues \nto impose its strict blockade on the Gaza Strip and to \ntarget Palestinian civilians by assassinations, air strikes \nand artillery shelling. It persists with its war of \naggression of three years ago on Gaza, which resulted \nthen in the massive destruction of homes, schools, \nhospitals and mosques and thousands of martyrs and \nwounded. The occupying Power also continues its \nincursions into areas of the Palestinian National \nAuthority through raids, arrests and killings at the \ncheckpoints.  \n In recent years, the criminal actions of armed \nsettler militias, who enjoy the special protection of the \noccupation army, have intensified. They have \nperpetrated frequent attacks against our people, \ntargeting their homes, schools, universities, mosques, \nfields, crops and trees. Today they killed one \nPalestinian who was protesting peacefully. Despite our \nrepeated warnings, the Israeli authorities have not \nacted to curb those attacks, and we hold them fully \nresponsible for the crimes of the settlers. \n Those are just a few examples of the policy of the \nIsraeli settlement occupation. That policy is \nresponsible for the repeated failure of the successive \ninternational attempts to salvage the peace process. \nThe policy will destroy the chances of achieving a two-\nState solution, upon which there is an international \nconsensus. Here I caution, and I caution aloud, that the \nsettlement policy threatens also to undermine the \nstructure of the Palestinian National Authority and \neven to end its existence. \n In addition, we now face new conditions not \npreviously imposed, conditions that will transform the \nraging conflict in our inflamed region into a religious \nconflict, one that will be a threat to the future of a \nmillion and a half Palestinians who are citizens of \nIsrael. We reject that eventuality; it is impossible for us \nto accept being dragged into it. \n All of those unilateral Israeli actions in our \ncountry are aimed at perpetuating the occupation. \nIsrael has re-established the civil and military authority \nin the West Bank by a unilateral action, and its military \nauthorities determine whether or not a Palestinian \ncitizen has the right to reside in any part of the \nPalestinian territory. Israel is the entity that decides to \nconfiscate our land and our water and to obstruct our \nmovement and the movement of goods, and indeed our \nwhole destiny. All of that is unilateral. Yet Israel \ncomplains of unilateralism \u2014 despite our agreements \nwith it, which forbid unilateral individual actions.  \n In 1974, our leader the late Yasser Arafat came to \nthis Hall and assured the members of the General \nAssembly of our affirmative pursuit for peace, urging \n \n \n27 11-51185 \n \nthe United Nations to realize the inalienable national \nrights of the Palestinian people, stating: \u201cDo not let the \nolive branch fall from my hand.\u201d (A/PV.2282, para. 82)  \n In 1988, President Arafat again addressed the \nGeneral Assembly, which convened in Geneva to hear \nhim. There he submitted the Palestinian peace \nprogramme adopted by the Palestine National Council \nat its session held that year in Algeria. When we \nadopted that programme, we were taking a painful and \nvery difficult step for all of us, especially those of us, \nincluding myself, who during the 1948 Al-Nakba were \nforced to leave their homes and their towns and \nvillages, carrying only some of our belongings \u2014 \nalong with our grief and our memories and the keys to \nour homes \u2014 to camps of exile and diaspora. That \ncatastrophic exodus was one of the worst operations of \nuprooting, destruction and removal of a vibrant and \ncohesive society that had been contributing in a \npioneering and leading way to the cultural, educational \nand economic renaissance of the Arab Middle East. \n Still, because we believe in peace, because of our \ncommitment to international legitimacy and because \nwe had the courage to make difficult decisions for our \npeople, and in the absence of absolute justice, we \ndecided to adopt the path of relative justice, justice that \nis possible and could correct part of the grave historical \ninjustice committed against our people. Thus, we \nagreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22 per \ncent of the territory of historical Palestine \u2014 on all the \nPalestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967. By \ntaking that historic step, which was welcomed by the \nStates of the world, we made a major concession in \norder to achieve a historic compromise that would \nallow peace to be made in the land of peace. \n In the years that followed, from the Madrid \nConference and the Washington negotiations leading to \nthe Oslo agreement, which we signed 18 years ago in \nthe White House garden and which was linked with the \nletters of mutual recognition \u2014 mutual recognition \u2014 \nbetween the PLO and Israel, we persevered and dealt \npositively and responsibly with all efforts aimed at the \nachievement of a lasting peace agreement. Yet, as we \nsaid earlier, every initiative, every conference, every \nnew round of negotiations and every movement was \nshattered on the rock of the Israeli settlement \nexpansion project. \n On behalf of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization \u2014 the sole legitimate representative of \nthe Palestinian people, which will remain so until the \nend of the conflict in all its aspects and until the \nresolution of all final status issues \u2014 I affirm the \nfollowing points.  \n The goal of the Palestinian people is the \nrealization of their inalienable national rights and of \ntheir independent State of Palestine, with East \nJerusalem as its capital, on all the land of the West \nBank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, \nwhich Israel occupied in the June 1967 war. This goal \nmust be realized in conformity with the resolutions of \ninternational legitimacy and with the achievement of a \njust and agreed-upon solution to the Palestine refugee \nissue in accordance with General Assembly resolution \n194 (III), as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative. \nThat Initiative presented the consensus Arab and \nIslamic vision to resolve the core of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict and to achieve the just and comprehensive \npeace to which we are committed and are working \ntowards.  \n We are committed to this. Achieving this much-\ndesired peace also requires the release of political \nprisoners, prisoners of freedom and Palestinian \ndetainees in Israeli prisons without delay. \n Secondly, the PLO and the Palestinian people are \ncommitted to renouncing violence and reject and \ncondemn terrorism in all its forms, especially State \nterrorism, including terrorism by settlers. We also \nadhere to all agreements signed between the PLO and \nIsrael. \n Thirdly, we are committed to the option of \nnegotiating a lasting solution to the conflict in \naccordance with the resolutions of international \nlegitimacy. I affirm here that the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization is ready to return immediately to the \nnegotiating table on the basis of the adopted terms of \nreference and consistent with international legitimacy \nand a complete cessation of settlement activities. \n Fourthly, our people will continue their popular \npeaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation, its \nsettlement and apartheid policies, and its construction \nof the racist separation Wall, and they receive support \nfor their resistance that is consistent with international \nhumanitarian law and international conventions. They \nhave the support of peace activists from Israel and \naround the world, reflecting an impressive, inspiring \nand courageous example of the strength of this \ndefenceless people, armed only with their dreams, \n  \n \n11-51185 28 \n \ncourage, hope and slogans in the face of bullets, tanks, \ntear gas and bulldozers. \n Fifthly, when we bring our plight and our case to \nthis international forum, it is a confirmation of our \nreliance on the political and diplomatic option and is a \nconfirmation of the fact that we do not undertake \nunilateral steps. Our efforts and moves are not aimed at \nisolating Israel or at delegitimizing it; rather, we want \nto gain legitimacy for the cause of the people of \nPalestine. We aim to delegitimize only the settlement \nactivities, the occupation and apartheid and the logic of \nruthless force, and we believe that all the countries of \nthe world stand with us in this regard. \n I am here to say on behalf of the Palestinian \npeople and the Palestine Liberation Organization that \nwe extend our hand to the Israeli Government and the \nIsraeli people for peacemaking. I say to them: let us \nurgently build together a future for our children where \nthey can enjoy freedom, security and prosperity. Let us \nbuild bridges of dialogue instead of checkpoints and \nwalls of separation. Let us build cooperative relations \nbased on parity, equity and friendship between two \nneighbouring States \u2014 Palestine and Israel \u2014 instead \nof policies based on occupation, settlement, war and \nelimination of the other. \n Despite the unquestionable right of our people to \nself-determination and to the establishment of an \nindependent State, as stipulated in international \nresolutions, we have accepted over the past few years \nto engage in what appeared to be a test of our \nworthiness, entitlement and eligibility. During the past \ntwo years, our national Authority has implemented a \nprogramme to build our State institutions. Despite the \nextraordinary situation and the obstacles imposed on us \nby Israel, a serious and extensive project was launched \nthat has included the implementation of plans to \nenhance and advance the judiciary and the apparatus \nfor the maintenance of order and security; the \ndevelopment of administrative, financial and oversight \nsystems; the upgrading of the performance of \ninstitutions; and enhancing self-reliance to reduce the \nneed for foreign aid.  \n With the support of brotherly Arab countries and \ndonors from friendly countries, for which we are \nthankful, a number of large infrastructure projects have \nbeen implemented, focused on various aspects of \nservices, with special attention to rural and \nmarginalized areas. In the midst of this massive \nnational project, we have been strengthening what we \nwish to be the features of our future State: the \npreservation of security for citizens and public order; \nthe promotion of judicial authority and the rule of law; \nstrengthening the role of women via legislation, laws \nand participation; ensuring the protection of public \nfreedoms and strengthening the role of civil society \ninstitutions; and institutionalizing rules and regulations \nfor ensuring accountability and transparency in the \nwork of our ministries and departments; to entrenching \nthe pillars of democracy as the basis of Palestinian \npolitical life. \n When division struck the unity of our homeland, \nour people and our institutions, we were determined to \nadopt dialogue as a path to the restoration of our unity. \nWe succeeded months ago in achieving national \nreconciliation, and we hope that its implementation \nwill be accelerated in the coming weeks. The core \npillar of this reconciliation involved turning to the \npeople through legislative and presidential elections, to \nbe conducted within a year, because the State we want \nis one characterized by the rule of law, the exercise of \ndemocracy, the protection of the freedoms and equality \nof all citizens without any discrimination, and the \ntransfer of power through the ballot box. \n We believe that the reports issued recently by the \nUnited Nations, the World Bank, the Ad Hoc Liaison \nCommittee for the Coordination of International \nAssistance to Palestinians (AHLC) and the \nInternational Monetary Fund have confirmed and \nlauded what has been accomplished, and have \nconsidered it an exceptional and unprecedented model. \nThe consensus conclusion of the AHLC a few days ago \nhere, in this very city, described what has been \naccomplished as a remarkable international success \nstory and confirmed the full readiness of the \nPalestinian people and their institutions for the \nimmediate independence of the State of Palestine. That \nwas a testimonial from the international community.  \n I do not believe that anyone with even a shred of \nconscience could reject our application for full \nmembership in the United Nations and our admission \nas an independent State. \n It is no longer possible to redress the issue of the \nblocked horizon of the peace talks with the same \nmeans and methods that have been repeatedly tried and \nhave proved unsuccessful in past years. \n \n \n29 11-51185 \n \n The crisis is far too deep to be neglected; it is far \nmore dangerous and critical to simply be circumvented \nor to postpone its inevitable explosion. It is neither \npossible, nor practical nor acceptable to return to \nconducting business as usual, as if everything were \nfine. It is futile to go into negotiations without clear \nparameters, terms of reference, credibility or a specific \ntimetable. Negotiations will be meaningless as long as \nthe occupation army on the ground continues to \nentrench its occupation instead of rolling it back, and \nto change the demography of our country in order to \ncreate a new basis on which to alter the borders. That is \ntotally unacceptable. \n This is the moment of truth. Our people are \nwaiting to hear the world\u2019s answer. Will it allow Israel \nto continue the last occupation in the world? We are the \nlast people to remain under occupation. Will the world \nallow Israel to occupy us forever and to remain a State \nabove the law and accountability? Will it allow Israel \nto continue rejecting the resolutions of the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly and the \nInternational Court of Justice and the positions of the \noverwhelming majority of countries in the world? Is \nthis acceptable? \n The heart of the crisis in our region is very simple \nand clear. There are those who believe that we are an \nunnecessary people in the Middle East and those who \nbelieve that there is in fact a missing State that needs to \nbe established immediately. I come before the General \nAssembly today from the Holy Land, the land of \nPalestine, the land of divine messages, ascension of the \nProphet Muhammad and the birthplace of Jesus Christ, \nto speak on behalf of the Palestinian people, in the \nhomeland and in the diaspora, and to say, after 63 years \nof suffering the ongoing Al-Nakba: enough, enough, \nenough.  \n It is time for the Palestinian people to gain their \nfreedom and independence. The time has come to end \nthe suffering and the plight of millions of Palestinian \nrefugees in the homeland and the diaspora, some of \nwhom have been forced to seek refuge more than once \nin different places of the world, to end their \ndisplacement, and to realize their rights. \n At a time when the Arab peoples affirm their \nquest for democracy \u2014 in what is now called the Arab \nSpring \u2014 the time has also come for the Palestinian \nSpring, the time for independence. The time has come \nfor our men, women and children to live normal lives; \nfor them to be able to sleep without waiting for the \nworst that the next day might bring; for mothers to be \nassured that their children will return home without \nfear of being killed, arrested or humiliated; for students \nto be able to go to their schools and universities \nwithout checkpoints obstructing them.  \n The time has come for sick people to be able to \nreach hospitals normally, and for our farmers to be able \nto tend their rich soil without fear that the occupier will \nseize their land and water, which the separation wall \nprevents access to, and without fear of the settlers with \ntheir guard dogs who attack Palestinians. They build \ntheir settlements on our lands and uproot and burn \nolive trees that have existed in Palestine for hundreds \nof years. The time has come for the thousands of \nprisoners of conscience and freedom to be released \nfrom prisons and return to their families and their \nchildren and become a part of building their homeland, \nfor the freedom of which they have sacrificed so much. \n My people want to exercise their right to enjoy a \nnormal life like the rest of humankind. They believe in \nwhat our great poet Mahmoud Darwish said: \u201cStanding \nhere, staying here, permanent here, eternal here, and \nwe have one goal, one goal, one goal - to be. And we \nshall be.\u201d \n We profoundly appreciate and value the positions \nof all the States that have supported our struggle and \nour rights and recognized the State of Palestine \nfollowing the Declaration of Independence in 1988, as \nwell as those that have recently recognized the State of \nPalestine and upgraded the level of Palestine\u2019s \nrepresentation in their capitals. I also salute Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who spoke the truth a few days \nago when he said that the Palestinian State should have \nbeen established years ago. \n The General Assembly may rest assured that such \nsupport for our people is more valuable to them than \nanyone can imagine, for it makes them feel that \nsomeone is listening to their narrative and that their \ntragedy, the horrors of Al-Nakba and the occupation, \nunder which they have suffered terribly, are not being \nignored. It reinforces their hope and belief that justice \nis possible in this world. The loss of hope is the most \nferocious enemy of peace, and despair is the strongest \nally of extremism. \n The time has come for my courageous and proud \npeople, after decades of displacement, colonial \noccupation and ceaseless suffering, to live like other \n  \n \n11-51185 30 \n \npeoples of the Earth, free in a sovereign and \nindependent homeland. \n Mr. President, I would like to inform you that, \nbefore delivering this statement, I, in my capacity as \nPresident of the State of Palestine and Chairman of the \nExecutive Committee of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization, submitted to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon an application for the admission of Palestine \nas a full Member of the United Nations on the basis of \nthe 4 June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \ncapital. \n I hold in my hands a copy of the application. I \ncall upon the Secretary-General to expedite transmittal \nof our request to the Security Council, and I call upon \nthe members of the Council to vote in favour of our \nfull membership. I also appeal to the States that have \nnot yet done so to recognize the State of Palestine. \n The support of the countries of the world for our \nendeavour is a victory for rights, freedom, justice, law \nand international legitimacy. It will provide \ntremendous support for the peace option and enhance \nthe negotiations\u2019 chances of success. The Assembly\u2019s \nassistance and support for the establishment of the \nState of Palestine and for its admission to the United \nNations as a full Member State are the greatest \ncontribution to peacemaking in the land of peace, and \nthroughout the world. \n I have come here today carrying a message from \na courageous and proud people. Palestine is \nexperiencing its rebirth. That is my message. May all \nthe people of the world stand with the people of \nPalestine now as they march steadfastly to meet their \nappointment with history, freedom and independence. \nAnd I hope that we will not have long to wait."

        "file_text": "I \nwould first like to congratulate the President on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-sixth session, and to assure him of Peru\u2019s firm \nsupport in his task. \n I would also like to say how pleased I am to be \nspeaking to the world on behalf of the people of Peru \nfrom this rostrum that represents multilateralism, \npeace, solidarity and cooperation, the principles that \ninspired the birth of this Organization and that Peru \nfully supports. \n The Government I head began its administration \nonly a few weeks ago. Through the ballot box, the \npeople of Peru entrusted us with the task of making a \ngreat transformation, one that we have sought for a \ngood part of our history. We intend to make that \ncommitment a reality, out of a sense of responsibility \nand honour. Our mythical and vibrant nation, possessed \nof an extraordinary past and a vigorous present, \ndemands that we put an end to centuries of poverty and \n \n \n13 11-50871 \n \nexclusion. The great transformation is a process of \nsocial inclusion, that is to say, of converting the \neconomic growth that Peruvians have been \nexperiencing for the last 10 years into development; in \nother words, we must turn money into quality of life. \n Our ideal of the great transformation is as \nimpossible to relinquish as is our democratic faith. My \nGovernment proposes to deepen our democracy, so that \nwe can respond to the problems and needs of all, not \njust a minority. In other words, we will democratize \ndemocracy. Democracy is the basis of a people\u2019s self-\ndetermination, and the State must be prepared to \nfaithfully carry out the people\u2019s will. That is the \nfoundation of a sovereign democracy. In order to fulfil \nthat commitment, the State must be the institution \nresponsible for shaping the path to transformation \nthrough public policies in both the political and \neconomic spheres. The State must act in the interests of \nthe people. \n The United Nations is the greatest guarantee we \nhave for preserving peace, and it is made up of our \nStates. Today, however, we know that there are \ncompanies that have as much power as or greater \npower than many States, and that can react rapidly via \nthe networks of the Internet and the stock market to put \nStates themselves in the dock of the accused. That \nsituation must be taken into account in order to \nsafeguard State policies concerning issues such as the \npreservation of the environment, respect for peoples\u2019 \nself-determination and the rights of indigenous \ncommunities and social minorities, among others. \n We cannot consider the possibility of \ntransformation outside the rule of law and its values. \nThis is not a question of copying others\u2019 models. We \nwill govern by consensus, both at home and abroad, \nprotecting all our freedoms with tolerance and, above \nall, by listening to our citizens, without regard to class, \nrace or gender. When I took office I quoted Nelson \nMandela, who said that there is no democracy with \npoverty, and no democracy with social inequality. Our \nGovernment seeks a State that can regain the ability to \npromulgate policies that respond to the needs and \naspirations of all its citizens. It is in that spirit that we \nare renewing our commitment to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n Latin America is the most unequal region in the \nworld. Its political class cannot say that the dream of \nthose who established our independence and founded \nthe republics of today, has come true. In most cases, \nvalues such as liberty, equality and fraternity were the \nbanners of our founders. However, extreme \ninterpretations of those values have led to a world of \ngreat confrontations, without really advancing liberty \nor equality. Let us now strengthen fraternity as a path \nto lasting peace. In that regard, I would like, from this \nrostrum, to take the opportunity to recognize the \nPalestinian State and its right to live in peace and \nharmony alongside other countries of the United \nNations. \n Today the integration of a geographically \nfragmented and scattered nation is possible, thanks to \nadvances in communications and physical \ninfrastructure. Social inclusion also demands quality \npublic services and equality of opportunity. Citizens \nneed access to health, education, housing, decent jobs \nand social security. We are talking about full \nintegration within Peruvian society. We are vigorously \npromoting exchanges between our communities, and \nwe acknowledge and seek to re-evaluate our diversity. \n We want a State that is responsive to the needs of \nits citizens and communities. That is its primary role. \nThe exploitation of non-renewable sovereign resources, \nwhich Peru is rich in, should serve the country\u2019s \ndevelopment. Investment projects should respect both \nthe human and the natural environments in which they \ntake place. This is already being made clear to \ninvestors through a negotiation process that my \nGovernment has undertaken within the framework of \nthe rule of law. Thanks to those negotiations, the State \nand our communities will have greater resources \navailable for social investment projects. That will \nenable us to promote social cohesion and democratic \nstability, and, at the same time, the more favourable \ninvestment environment that the country needs. One of \nthe first measures we took was to enact a law on prior \nconsultation, through which we can respond to the \ndemands of our indigenous communities, involving \nthem in decisions that concern them. In that way we \nare affirming that every Peruvian is a first-class citizen, \nand we are fulfilling a commitment made by Peru in \ncompliance with Convention 169 of the International \nLabour Organization concerning indigenous and tribal \npeoples. \n Drug trafficking is one of the world\u2019s most \nserious issues. It is essential that we recognize the fact \nthat this major problem has not been overcome; worse, \nits power and influence are growing every day. \n  \n \n11-50871 14 \n \nAcknowledging this reality is an important step, which \nwill enable us to re-establish an integrated policy, \nworking together with stakeholders and giving equal \nimportance to both controlling supply and reducing \ndemand. For Peru, these principles also involve States\u2019 \nduty to act decisively and cooperatively in order to \ncombat every link in that criminal chain. Coca \nproduction is a source of income for tens of thousands \nof people who cannot always rely on a viable \nalternative for survival. My Government is working to \nachieve a situation in which anti-drug policies lead to \nthe eradication of illegal coca crops, and is also \nconsidering the need to include peasant farmers in \nalternative development programmes. Unless we do, \neradication will simply be insufficient to achieve our \nobjectives. We must act more vigorously in combating \nthe transnational criminal organizations that are the \nmain beneficiaries of this illegal trade. Those \norganizations employ thousands of people and exploit \nthe poverty and vulnerabilities of States in areas where \naccess is difficult. \n At the same time, we require greater financial \nknowledge in order to detect money-laundering \nactivities and more effective controls over supplies and \nprecursors. In the context of security, we must control \nthe supply of weapons that the cartels and criminal \ngangs use daily against citizens. \n In the second quarter of next year, we will \nconvene in Lima a meeting of ministers for foreign \naffairs, and heads of organizations responsible for \ncombating drugs in order to address these issues and \ndefine specific measures. My Government will spare \nno effort in combating the drug trade and organized \ncrime.  \n Peru is a multicultural country that is in the \nprocess of recognizing the wealth of its own diversity. \nFor example, our country today is undergoing a \ngastronomical revolution that has revealed that \ndiversity contributes to social inclusion and sustainable \ndevelopment. Peruvian cooking is an area in which all \nPeruvians \u2014 from the peasant and the cook to the \nfisherman and the tradesman \u2014 can participate \ntogether. It is based on a millennial dialogue among \nmany cultures \u2014 indigenous, African, European, Arab \nand Asian \u2014 that is represented today in our cuisine. \nFor that reason, we have called on UNESCO to \nrecognize Peruvian cooking as a representative element \nof the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  \n Technological and scientific progress has grown \nexponentially over the past 50 years. Currently, \nhowever, there has been a parallel growth of global \nexclusion. This is seen not only in the lack of access to \ntechnology, but also in the mass migrations of people \nseeking better opportunities abroad. Those people, who \nare known as illegals, are in fact a bridge for \nintegration. However, in many cases the needs that \nmotivate them to move abroad lead to violations of \ntheir human rights. I take this opportunity to call for \nfairer and more dignified treatment for peoples who \ncontribute through their work to the economies of their \ncountries of origin and of residence. Their \nmarginalization this will push them into informal \neconomies run by mafias and criminal networks.  \n With respect to social inclusion, my Government \nis prioritizing the needs of the most fragile and \nvulnerable, such as children and the elderly. However, \nwe are also concerned with the need to protect the \nrights of women, who have historically been victims of \ndiscrimination. In this regard, I note the positive \ndecision to create UN-Women. We call on the \ninternational community to work together to promote \ngender equality and the empowerment of women. We \nalso reiterate our commitment to the Durban \nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted at the \nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial \nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \nwhose tenth anniversary we celebrate today. \n The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas \nemissions are being felt in the most vulnerable social \nsectors yet affect us all, rich and poor alike. In the \ncontext of the global attempt to preserve the planet, we \nmust all be committed. In Peru, we are working to \npromote the use of clean energy through reforestation, \nenvironmental education and recognition of the right of \nparticipation and access of communities that possess \ntraditional knowledge. That will require a large amount \nof resources and technology that are more abundant in \nthe northern hemisphere. Therefore, we reaffirm the \nprinciple of shared but differentiated responsibility \nbetween developed countries and developing countries. \nInternational cooperation must enhance the level of \nfinancial and technical assistance to mitigate the \neffects of climate change. \n Industrialized countries must assume and fulfil \nthe commitment to significantly reduce their carbon \nemissions. On 28 July in Lima, the Heads of States of \nthe Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) \n \n \n15 11-50871 \n \ncalled attention to the threats posed to our economies \nby situations that originated in the United States, \nEurope and Asia, linked to the high level of public debt \nand unemployment and the slow recovery of credit \nmarkets and investment. Of course, is the situation is \nalso due to military ambitions that have diverted vast \namounts of money that could have been used to prevent \nthese crises.  \n Latin American countries are learning how to \novercome our chronic vulnerability in the face of these \ncrises. We have decided to work together, coordinating \nour policies to enhance the economic underpinnings of \nour countries and the monitoring of our financial \nsystems. We have established the South American \nCouncil of Economy and Finance, reflecting our \ncapacity to encourage dialogue and establish consensus \nto the benefit of all.  \n Latin America will not be spared the problems \nthat have affected the North. We are making \npreparations. It is not enough to be linked to one \nanother; we must be united. The twenty-first century \nmay well be the moment for this part of the continent \nand its great market of more than 700 million people. \nOur commitment to integration, peace and regional \nprogress is not rhetorical. For the Peruvian \nGovernment, integration with our neighbouring \ncountries is a priority instrument for promoting \nsecurity and development for all throughout South \nAmerica and Latin America. This is in line with of the \naffirmation that the path to peace and reconciliation \nrequires an end to the blockade on Cuba.  \n As V\u00edctor Andr\u00e9s Bela\u00fande said on assuming the \npresidency of the General Assembly in 1959: \n \u201cIn centuries gone by, the arrogant will to power \nprevailed. Today mankind not only yearns to, but \nmust, live in a world ruled by justice.\u201d (A/PV.795, \npara. 33) \n The interdependence of our societies is a fact. It \nis not necessary to create further divisions. When \nmaking decisions, we must learn to talk to one another \nand to involve the viewpoints of the many actors of the \ninternational system. Peru reasserts its full support for \nenlarging the Security Council to make it more \nrepresentative and enhance its legitimacy. \n It is urgent to also advance reform of the \nEconomic and Social Council in order to make it a \ngenuine, fundamental forum for the development of all \npeoples of the world. \n The priority we give to regional integration in no \nway implies that ours is closed regionalism. That \nwould be anachronistic in a globalized world. Although \nour foreign policy is based on brotherhood in South \nAmerica and Latin America, we will not neglect our \npolitical, trade and cooperation relations with other \nregions of the globe. On the contrary, our regionalism \nwill provide a platform to bring us closer, in a more \narticulated and proactive way, with other regions of the \nworld. \n Our participation in multilateral forums will \nincrease in coherence. Global political stability \nrequires intergovernmental organizations and strong \nregional groups that are capable of maintaining that \nmultipolar order that is emerging in our world."

        "file_text": "Twenty years ago, \nLithuania rejoined the international community of \nsovereign States and became a Member of the United \nNations. The unique experience of peaceful transition, \nState-building and reforms during the past 20 years has \nmade Lithuania stronger and more determined. History \nhas taught us that an honest broker at the national, \n  \n \n11-50871 16 \n \nbilateral or multilateral level is the key to solving \nalmost any problem.  \n In recent years, we have invested in building our \ncapacity to become such a broker. Lithuania has just \nconcluded its chairmanship of the Community of \nDemocracies. Today, we are proud to chair the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I \nam also confident that Lithuania\u2019s commitment to \neffective multilateralism and the fostering of dialogue \nand cooperation internationally makes it a deserving \ncandidate for non-permanent membership of the \nSecurity Council. We are ready and determined to run \nfor a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for \nthe 2014-15 term.  \n Meanwhile, looking forward to Lithuania\u2019s \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \nsession next year, I would like to assure members that \nwe will do our utmost to contribute effectively and \nwisely to the work and principles of the United Nations \nin all of its bodies. \n Just a few months ago, women leaders from all \nparts of the world met in Vilnius to share their \nexperiences in enhancing democracy worldwide. This \nevent, organized by Lithuania as Chair of the \nCommunity of Democracies, confirmed my belief that \nthe involvement of women in addressing common \nproblems and concerns is still very low. Therefore, \nLithuania strongly welcomed resolution 65/283 on \nstrengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \nresolution, proposed by Finland and Turkey and \nadopted by the General Assembly. I am very pleased \nthat that resolution advocates the enhanced role of \nwomen in peace mediation. The full involvement of \nwomen in conflict resolution, peace talks and decisions \non post-conflict reconstruction is essential.  \n The same applies to the protection of women in \nconflict situations as defined in the historic Security \nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions. \nI would like to announce that Lithuania has drawn up \nits first national action plan for implementing \nresolution 1325 (2000). \n We live in an era of constant change. The \nmaintenance and improvement of our ability to tackle \ntraditional crises must be supplemented with an \nincreased capacity of the United Nation to address such \nnew threats and challenges as energy security, \ncybercrime, food safety and climate change, to mention \nonly a few. I especially appreciate and would like to \nstress the importance of the Secretary-General\u2019s strong \nengagement in nuclear safety and his call to build a \nstronger connection between nuclear safety and nuclear \nsecurity.  \n In the light of the world\u2019s energy needs today, \nnuclear energy can be an essential element of \nsustainable global development, provided it is used \nwith necessary responsibility. I would like to draw the \nAssembly\u2019s special attention to the word \n\u201cresponsibility\u201d. Chernobyl and Fukushima are tragic \nexamples, but they teach us very important lessons. It \nis not enough to rely only on recommendations, \nproposals and encouragement for cooperation when we \ndeal with nuclear safety issues. I believe that our \nresponsibility is to create strict legal international \nimperatives. We cannot allow any compromises on \nsafety and security. \n In this respect, the efforts of the United Nations, \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the \nEuropean Union and other organizations to ensure \nnuclear safety throughout the world are critically \nneeded today. Lithuania emphasizes the key role of the \nIAEA in this area. We welcome the ambitious nuclear \nsafety action plan that was adopted by the IAEA \nGeneral Conference in Vienna today.  \n Lithuania believes that strict adherence to \nuniform nuclear safety standards must be obligatory. \nSpecialized Agency missions for the entire nuclear \ncycle, including site evaluation and follow-up \nmissions, should also become an inseparable part of \nany nuclear power plant development. Each and every \nnuclear power plant, its site, nuclear technology and \neven the ability of the personnel to ensure safety \nmaintenance should be subject to stress tests. Last but \nnot least, information about all existing and planned \nnuclear projects must be absolutely transparent and \nopen to public access. \n We believe that the nuclear security summit in the \nRepublic of Korea next year will provide an excellent \nplatform for discussing nuclear safety and security \nissues for the whole world. With a view to that \nforthcoming summit, Lithuania is ready to contribute \nto the practical measures set forth in the 2010 Nuclear \nSecurity Summit Work Plan. \n The prevention of any type of crisis \u2014 be it a \nmilitary conflict, a nuclear accident or a terrorist \nattack \u2014 is a challenge for all of us. But it is also an \n \n \n17 11-50871 \n \nopportunity: an opportunity to strengthen the United \nNations leadership, an opportunity to intensify our \njoint work, an opportunity to promote dialogue and \nmediation, and even an opportunity to save resources \nthat can then be devoted to research and development, \nprotection of the environment and support for the most \nvulnerable. I invite us all to seize that opportunity for \nthe sake of our common safety, security and prosperity, \nwhich is what we all wish for."

We deeply appreciate \nhis leadership and wish him continued success in his \nsecond term in office as he guides the United Nations \nin these challenging times. \n Slovenia welcomes the President\u2019s decision to put \nthe theme of mediation at the centre of our \ndeliberations at this session. Indeed, no other theme \nseems more timely at this moment of search for an \napproach towards a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict. The European Union, to which \nSlovenia belongs, is currently fully engaged with high-\nprofile mediation in this context. The mediation under \nway has two aims. \n The first is the revival of the peace process with a \nview to finding an early solution \u2014 a genuine and fair \npeace agreement involving two States, Israel and \nPalestine, which would live side by side in peace and \nsecurity. Secondly, an immediate task relevant to the \nUnited Nations is to find an adequate status for \nPalestine within the ranks of our common, global \nOrganization. Those two aims are genuinely linked, \nand the latter should be understood as supporting the \nformer. \n Our common Organization, the United Nations, is \ncommitted to its inclusive character and the \nuniversality of its membership. This is the spirit in \nwhich we see some of the significant developments of \nthis year.  \n We welcome the Republic of South Sudan as the \nnewest Member of the United Nations. Our \nOrganization should render every assistance to the new \nMember in its efforts to establish its structures and to \nserve the wellbeing of its people. \n We also welcome the decision of the General \nAssembly to grant the seat of Libya to the \nrepresentatives of the National Transitional Council of \nLibya. This has established a much needed link \nbetween the United Nations and the people of Libya in \ntheir effort to build legitimate, democratic and \neffective institutions and to pursue the path of \neconomic, social and political development, in \naccordance with the wishes of the people.  \n Yesterday, at a special High-level Meeting we \ndiscussed the forms of assistance in some detail. Today \nwe can say that there is a fair chance of success for \neffective cooperation between the people of Libya and \nthe United Nations as well as the regional \norganizations \u2014 in particular, the African Union and \nthe Arab League. Together we shall be better able to \nassist. Slovenia is willing to continue to do its part in \nthis framework. \n Political and security concerns are always an \nimportant priority for the United Nations. But they \nhave to be considered against the background of other \npriorities, both long-term and short-term. The \nOrganization has developed its engagements in the \nmost important and the most difficult issues of \nenvironment and sustainable development. We need to \ntake resolute steps towards a new and effective system \nto mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure the \nnecessary adaptation.  \n We hope that the Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, to be held in Durban later this year, will bring \nus a step closer to final agreement. The negative \nimpacts of climate change are disproportionate. We \nshould pay particular attention to the unique challenges \nfaced by the small island developing States, whose \ncharacteristics make them among the most vulnerable \nin the world to climate change. \n The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, to be held next year, will be an \nopportunity to secure renewed political commitment to \nsustainable development, to assess the progress of \nimplementation of agreed commitments, and to address \nnew and emerging challenges. We should strengthen \nour efforts to develop a new concept of development \nthat will capture economic growth, social development \nand environmental protection. It is our duty to make a \ndifference, and making a difference requires a more \ncomprehensive definition of development. \n Maintaining our focus on the successful \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \nwe should pay particular attention to the special needs \nof Africa, especially those countries most in need. The \nIstanbul Programme of Action offers concrete solutions \nfor improving progress in the least developed \ncountries. \n In times of economic crisis in the donor \ncountries, which seems to continue unabated, \nincreasing aid proves difficult to attain. Improving aid \neffectiveness is crucial.  \n \n \n17 11-50847 \n \n There can be no gain in the field of development \nif other policies, such as trade, agriculture, migration, \nclimate change and so on, cancel out the positive \neffects of development policies. In this regard, let me \nconvey our hopes for the successful deliberations of \nthe High-level Forum to be held in Busan later this \nyear. \n Recent experience in the exercise of development \nactivities has strengthened understanding of the links \nbetween development and human rights. The concept \nof the right to development is gaining in substance and \nrecognition. Moreover, specific development tasks \nhave provided further evidence of the importance of \nthis link. The role of women in development is a \npertinent example. Experience and research by the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations, for example, have shown that empowerment \nof women in agriculture can reduce hunger by 30 per \ncent \u2014 a very impressive result by any measure.  \n Gender equality and the empowerment of women \nare essential to promoting peace, security and above all \ndevelopment. Slovenia strongly supports the work of \nUN-Women, which will help to significantly boost \nUnited Nations efforts to promote gender equality, \nexpand opportunities and tackle discrimination against \nwomen around the globe. \n Another priority in the field of human rights that \nSlovenia values highly relates to the rights of the child \nand to human rights education. This year, as President \nof the Executive Board of UNICEF, Slovenia worked \ntirelessly to attain universal ratification of both \noptional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of \nthe Child. The objective should be to ensure, through \nUnited Nations instruments and national action, \neffective protection of the rights of the child and to \nimprove the wellbeing of children in all parts of the \nworld. \n An important segment of this work relates to \nhuman rights education, which helps to empower \nyoung people in their efforts to secure their rightful \nplace in society. I remember when Slovenia and Costa \nRica launched a human rights education campaign in \nthe Third Committee almost 20 years ago. It is \ngratifying to see that today human rights are \nincreasingly being included in official school \ncurriculums. But there is still much more that we need \nto do to incorporate human rights learning into \nsocieties as a lifelong process. The United Nations, its \nHuman Rights Council and the General Assembly will, \nI am convinced, continue to make a significant \ncontribution.  \n I would like to express satisfaction over the \nadoption of the draft declaration on human rights \neducation and training by the Human Rights Council \nduring its March session this year. I call on all States to \nsupport this important declaration, which I am \nconvinced the General Assembly will adopt \u2014 \nhopefully, unanimously \u2014 later this autumn. \n Human rights concerns are most tragic in the case \nof humanitarian disasters. The current famine in the \nHorn of Africa is a sad example. It is a crisis of human \nexistence and human rights. All actors of the \ninternational community, including my country, \nSlovenia, are already trying to help. But more help is \nneeded; humanitarian assistance must expand. \n I have briefly referred to some of Slovenia\u2019s areas \nof particular importance, particular engagement and \nparticular activity. Our commitment to the United \nNations is strong and will remain strong.  \n The United Nations is an Organization of all and \nfor all. For almost 20 years now Slovenia has been \nworking as a devoted Member State. We have made \nproposals for specific action and enjoyed working with \nall other Member States \u2014 large and small, \ngeographically close and geographically distant. We \nhave worked together on specific proposals and \ndecisions and on implementation. \n We have also proposed a set of ideas for reform \nof the Security Council. We hope that the coming year \nwill see more resolute steps in that regard, and that \nmore progress will be made than there has been so far. \n The United Nations is an important hope \u2014 a \nhope for the world \u2014 and an opportunity for its \nMember States to bring the reality, complicated and \nonerous as it may be, closer to our hopes. It is in this \nspirit that Slovenia has presented its candidature for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council. We hope \nfor broad support.  \n If we are elected we shall be a faithful United \nNations Member State, aware of the responsibilities of \nthe Security Council and all its members towards the \nentire Organization and all Member States. We pledge \nour efforts, our judgement and our sense of fairness as \na contribution to the United Nations. And fairness is a \n  \n \n11-50847 18 \n \ncommodity, a principle, a value, that the international \ncommunity needs most of all."

        "file_text": "I take this opportunity to once \nagain congratulate the President on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I am confident that his long years of \ndiplomatic service and experience will be crucial in \nsteering the work of this session to a complete success. \nAllow me to also congratulate His Excellency \n \n \n5 11-50871 \n \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to a \nsecond term. This demonstrates our collective trust and \nconfidence in his leadership. \n The twenty-first century presents us with new and \ncomplex security challenges arising, among other \nthings, from a range of political, economic, financial \nand environmental factors. This session of the General \nAssembly offers opportunities to address the \nchallenges that we face collectively. Most significant is \nthe promotion of mediation as a tool for conflict \nmanagement and the peaceful settlement of disputes \nbetween and within States.  \n In that context, the role of regional organizations \nin the mediation and resolution of conflicts is of \nincreasing importance. On the African continent, the \nAfrican Union (AU) and regional organizations such as \nthe East African Community and the Intergovernmental \nAuthority on Development (IGAD) continue to serve \nas significant building blocks in the search for global \npeace and security. As the Assembly is aware, IGAD is \nat the forefront of efforts to bring peace to Somalia and \nthe Sudan. I am pleased that Kenya\u2019s role in both cases \nhas been, and remains, crucial. \n On 9 July, we witnessed the birth of a new nation, \nSouth Sudan. I wish to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate and welcome the Republic of South Sudan \nto the community of nations. The independence of \nSouth Sudan and its entry into the United Nations \nfamily is the result of intense negotiations under \nIGAD, safeguarded by the AU and the international \ncommunity. This success story exemplifies the \npotential of regional organizations to resolve complex \nand deep-rooted conflicts. I would like to reiterate \nKenya\u2019s continued commitment to engage with both \nthe Sudan and South Sudan, through IGAD as well as \nbilaterally, in their efforts to resolve the outstanding \nissues under the just concluded Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement. I am confident that the leadership of both \nthe Sudan and South Sudan will continue to \ndemonstrate their commitment, courage and resolve in \nthat effort. We will also maintain active support for the \nAfrican Union High-level Implementation Panel on the \nSudan, led by former President Thabo Mbeki. \n The recent improvement in the security situation \nin Mogadishu gives us great optimism. This has been \nachieved through the concerted efforts of the \nTransitional Federal Government (TFG), supported by \nthe African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and \nthe international community. The exit of Al-Shabaab \nfrom Mogadishu provides a unique window of \nopportunity for the international community to rally \nbehind Somalia and consolidate the gains made thus \nfar. I urge the United Nations and the international \ncommunity to seize the moment, support IGAD and \npartner with the TFG in the efforts to restore lasting \npeace and stability to Somalia.  \n As a first step, I call upon the international \ncommunity to enhance the mandate of AMISOM by \nproviding it with the necessary enablers and resources. \nOnly then can AMISOM have the required capacity to \nextend its coverage and control. In addition, we must \nsupport the TFG in the implementation of the Kampala \nAccord, which spells out a range of political processes \nnecessary for the attainment of sustainable peace and \ndevelopment in Somalia. \n The complex challenge of climate change \ncontinues to manifest itself in the Horn of Africa. As \nthe General Assembly is aware, the region is currently \nexperiencing the worst drought in 60 years. The \ndrought has resulted in a severe crisis that is affecting \nmore than 12 million people. The region is now \nsuffering from increased environmental stress, the loss \nof livelihoods and intense competition for scarce \nresources. Moreover, the situation has sometimes led to \narmed conflict among neighbouring communities. This \nreality requires us to enhance the regional capacity for \nearly warning systems and adequate response \narrangements. \n The scale of climate change and environmental \ndegradation calls for sustained action. In that regard, \nKenya hopes that the seventeenth session of the \nConference of Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Durban, will deliver on African expectations in the \nform of support for adaptation measures. Furthermore, \nKenya believes that the international organizations \nworking on the environment will be streamlined and \ngiven sufficient support. In that regard, the \ntransformation of the United Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP) into a specialized United Nations \nagency, as recommended by the AU, will be of critical \nimportance. It is my hope that the Rio Summit \nscheduled for next year in Brazil will endorse this \nposition and upgrade UNEP accordingly. \n Finally, I cannot conclude my statement today \nwithout once again restating Kenya\u2019s position on the \n  \n \n11-50871 6 \n \nissue of Palestine. Kenya believes in the two-State \nsolution where the territorial integrity of Palestine \nwithin the 1967 borders is upheld and the peace and \nsecurity of Israel are both assured and guaranteed. It is \ntherefore our hope that Palestine will be welcomed into \nthe community of nations with full membership in the \nUnited Nations."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like \nto join previous speakers in expressing my sincere \ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are \nconfident that under his able leadership, our \ndeliberations will be guided towards a successful \nconclusion. \n I would like also to take this opportunity to \nwarmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon \non being unanimously chosen by the General Assembly \nto serve a second term as Secretary-General. The Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia acknowledges with great \nadmiration his outstanding leadership and untiring \nefforts to overcome the many current global \nchallenges. \n Cambodia warmly welcomes the Republic of \nSouth Sudan as a new Member of the United Nations. \nWe will continue to dispatch more peacekeepers under \nwith United Nations peacekeeping operations to help \nwith humanitarian activities and demining in that \nfriendly new State. \n We live in an interconnected world where global \nchallenges such as economic and financial crises, \nclimate change, energy and food security, terrorism and \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \namong others, have become increasingly complex and \ncontinue to haunt the entire world. \n The global economy remains somewhat fragile, \nand there are many risks and challenges to a durable \nexit from the crisis. The growth of the world economy \nhas decelerated in 2011, and the global economy now \nfaces three major challenges: sovereign debt, slow \ngrowth and social instability.  \n The problem of unemployment has been very \nsevere in the advanced economies, and inflation is \nemerging in the developing economies. That has \ncreated havoc in many parts of the world, as continued \ninstability in the financial sector, especially in the \n  \n \n11-51384 22 \n \nUnited States and the euro zone, has dampened global \ntrade. That has an effect on exports, in particular of \ndeveloping countries. Therefore, a wide range of policy \nresponses and long-overdue reforms must be \nimplemented to accelerate growth and bring the global \neconomy out of the crisis. \n The crisis has reaffirmed the importance of \nreform in global economic and financial governance, \nincluding strengthening the institutional role of the \nInternational Monetary Fund.  \n Asia has become an essential partner in the global \neconomy and has taken the lead in advancing global \nrecovery. For instance, Cambodia\u2019s economy is \ngrowing, after a decline in 2008 and 2009, with an \nexpected growth rate of 8.7 per cent this year. With \nstrong, robust economies, East Asia and the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations are well \npositioned to assume their responsibilities to contribute \nto addressing the global economic and financial crisis. \n Although some significant successes have been \nachieved in attaining the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), most developing countries, in \nparticular least developed countries (LDCs), will \ncontinue to face many huge hurdles on their path to \nreach the MDG targets. \n Continued economic and financial instability in \nthe developed world has exacerbated uncertainty in \nfunding for development projects in poor countries. \nPersistently high fuel oil prices are straining every \neconomic aspect of developing countries. The \nworsening food security situation is holding back \nprogress in reducing malnutrition and child mortality. \nThe burden of debt repayment constitutes another \nmajor challenge for the LDCs in meeting the MDG \ntargets.  \n Faced with these tremendous challenges, poverty \nreduction remains the highest and foremost global \npriority. It requires steady economic growth and a more \npro-poor policy. \n In the context of the global effort to meet the \nMillennium Development Goals, Cambodia has been \nlisted among the 20 countries making the most absolute \nprogress on the MDGs. Last year it was accorded the \n2010 MDG Award by the MDG Awards Committee in \nNew York for its outstanding progress towards \nachievement of Goal 6. \n There is no doubt that climate change, with its \ndevastating impact worldwide, has become a constant \nthreat to our existence. Drought and flooding have \nbecome more frequent and more severe in many parts \nof the world, affecting millions of people. The current \nhorrific drought in the Horn of Africa represents \nanother most painful tragedy caused by global \nwarming. The threat of climate change is a reality and \na huge challenge for the global community. \n It is regrettable that many of the promises made \nduring the Copenhagen and Canc\u00fan meetings of the \nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference to assist \ndeveloping countries cope with climate change remain \nto be delivered in a timely manner. Now, while the \nworld is facing further financial turmoil, let us not \nforget that actions on climate change cannot wait. \nClimate change is progressing every day, triggering \nmore frequent natural disasters. The developing \ncountries are hoping for timely support for their efforts \nto address, adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate \nchange and to develop clean energy. They call on the \ndeveloped world to honour their commitments under \nthe Copenhagen and Canc\u00fan conferences. \n The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange in Durban, South Africa, in November must \nnot become another delusion but a place to demonstrate \nour collective will to share the responsibility and to \nachieve a real breakthrough in facing climate change. \nWhile obstacles remain to achieving a binding accord, \nCambodia hopes that the Kyoto Protocol, which is due \nto expire next year, will be extended during the Durban \nconference. \n Cambodia, for its part, successfully launched its \nown initiative, which is called Cambodia Climate \nChange Alliance, in 2009, with the objective of \nstrengthening our national institutions to deal with \nclimate change risks. Cambodia is also implementing \nnumerous projects within the framework of the United \nNations Collaborative Programme on Reducing \nEmissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation \nin Developing Countries while actively promoting \nadaptation and mitigation measures through our project \nto promote climate-resilient water management and \nagricultural practices in rural Cambodia. \n Food and energy security remain major issues of \nglobal concern. Although the recent surge in energy \ncosts has subsided, the price of fuel oil remains \n \n \n23 11-51384 \n \nextremely volatile. High fuel oil prices are a major \nburden on poor countries, which lack financial \nresources and know-how to develop alternative and \nclean energy sources. As the world depends heavily on \nfuel oil, we should act in concert to prevent unruly \nspeculation and price instability, which have \ndevastating effects on developing countries\u2019 efforts to \nreduce poverty and meet the MDG targets. It may be \ntime to consider establishing a world body comprised \nof major fuel oil producers and consumers to ensure a \nreasonable price limit. The world should not be at the \nmercy of oil producers. \n A more holistic approach for addressing energy \nsecurity is the transfer of relevant knowledge and \ntechnology to assist developing countries in exploiting \nalternative sources of energy. Reduced reliance on \nfossil fuel will also contribute significantly to slowing \nthe pace of global warming and climate change while \nreducing emissions of the harmful greenhouse gases \nproduced by burning fuel oil. \n On the other hand, energy security is closely \nlinked to food security. Soaring fuel oil prices in recent \nyears have not only caused food prices to rise but have \nalso reduced land devoted to agriculture through the \nchange to production of bioenergy as an alternative to \nfuel oil. A balanced approach must be taken to address \nthat twin problem. Food insecurity is also caused and \naggravated by the global financial and economic \nmeltdown and increasing world population. \n The number of undernourished people in the \nworld remains unacceptably high. Global population \ngrowth will inevitably lead to increased demand for \nboth energy and food.  \n For its part, Cambodia is doing its best to \ncontribute to world food security by intensifying rice \nproduction as the top priority of Government policy. \nMore and more rice will be available for export. \nCambodia is also seeking to establish an association of \nrice exporters under the framework of the Ayeyawady-\nChao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy, \ncomprised of five rice-exporting countries in South-\nEast Asia: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and \nViet Nam. The association will contribute to stabilizing \nthe food market and preventing speculation in food \nprices.\n With respect to global peace and security, one of \ntoday\u2019s gravest threats to humanity is terrorism. \nDespite the enormous efforts made by the international \ncommunity to prevent and combat acts of terrorism, \nsuch acts continue to occur daily almost everywhere in \nthe world. No country has been spared by terrorism. Its \nnetworks comprise a vast and complex web of \ninterlinked criminal activities, including money-\nlaundering, weapons trafficking and organized crime.  \n It is therefore time for us to consider whether the \nantiterrorism measures adopted to date have been \nsufficient. Cambodia fully supports United Nations \nefforts to create a global coalition against terrorism. In \nthat context, Cambodia believes that there is an urgent \nneed to finalize the draft United Nations global \ncounter-terrorism convention, which has been \ndiscussed for many years within the Organization. The \nadoption of that convention would strengthen and \nbroaden the legal frameworks to combat those crimes \nagainst humanity. \n On weapons of mass destruction, the international \ncommunity has made notable progress in recent years \nin the area of arms control and disarmament. Cambodia \nwelcomes the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty \nsigned last year by the United States and Russia, which \nhas made an important contribution towards \neliminating weapons of mass destruction. However, \nexisting nuclear weapon stockpiles remain a serious \nthreat to humanity. Cambodia requests States that have \nnot yet signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \nTreaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons to do so as soon as possible, for we \nall share the responsibility to guarantee a more secure \nworld for all. \n In that context, Cambodia has participated for \nseveral years in demining operations in South Sudan, \nLebanon and in other United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions, including Chad and the Central African \nRepublic.  \n The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the \nmost protracted and volatile conflicts in the Middle \nEast. Cambodia calls on the two parties to manifest \npolitical will to overcome their mutual animosity in \norder create an atmosphere conducive to the \nresumption of peace negotiations in the interests of \nboth Palestinians and Israelis. \n  \n \n11-51384 24 \n \n Cambodia has always supported the creation of \nthe Palestinian State based upon its 1967 borders. In \nthat spirit, Cambodia supports the rights of Palestine to \nbecome a full Member of the United Nations at this \nsession of the General Assembly. Moreover, it must be \nacknowledged that neither Palestinians nor Israelis \ncould live anywhere else. It would therefore be far \nbetter if both peoples could live side by side in peace \nand as good neighbours. Cambodia sees no other \nsolution to that issue. \n The embargo against Cuba has lasted for too \nlong. Today it is an anachronism, a terrible injustice \nagainst the Cuban people, who have been the first to \nsuffer. That is why Cambodia is today renewing its call \nfor lifting this embargo, which has brought the Cuban \npeople nothing but suffering. It is time to end the \nsanctions and put an end to the long trial they have \nundergone. \n Given the changes in the world of today and the \nmultiple challenges they bring, the main bodies of the \nUnited Nations should be reformed in order to deal \nwith the problems we currently confront. Cambodia \nbelieves that such reform must be comprehensive. If \nwe cannot arrive at a consensus on Security Council \nreform today, perhaps we should move forward with \nreform of the General Assembly, so as to give it more \npower and thus enable it to play a more meaningful \nrole in tackling the great challenges of our time, as the \nmost representative and democratic body of the United \nNations. In regard to the Security Council, reforms \nshould ensure that it reflects the realities of today\u2019s \nworld through equitable distribution of representation \namong permanent and non-permanent members."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, \nMr. President, to join previous speakers in \ncongratulating you warmly on your assumption of \noffice to preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. Your election is testimony to the \ngrowing confidence of the international community in \nthe ability and commitment of the smaller Members of \nthis Organization to play an increasingly active and \nresponsible role in the United Nations. I would also \nlike to take this opportunity to place on record our deep \nand abiding appreciation to your predecessor, \nMr. Joseph Deiss, for the exemplary manner in which \nhe guided the work of the sixty-fifth session. \n Allow me also to convey my sincere felicitations \nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, on his re-election for a second term. We \nremain confident that his experience and leadership \nwill ensure that this Organization, in which so many of \nour hopes and dreams are invested, will be equal to the \nmany complex challenges facing us during these \ntumultuous times. \n We are at a defining moment in history. Across \nthe Middle East and North Africa, popular \npro-democracy uprisings are sweeping away \nlongstanding dictatorships. We are witnessing the \ngreatest liberation movement since the fall of the \nBerlin Wall. But what is most striking is that it is \nhappening in countries with predominantly Muslim \npopulations. The democratic uprisings across the \nMiddle East prove that Muslims yearn for democratic \nrights just as much as non-Muslims.  \n For me, that is not surprising. After all, we are all \nhuman. We all feel resentment if those in power steal \nour county\u2019s wealth. We all feel frustrated if we are \nprevented from speaking our minds.  \n In the fog and confusion of the turmoil we are \nwitnessing in the Middle East, one thing stands \nabundantly clear. The demand for human rights and \ndemocratic values is universal. The march of \ndemocracy is inevitable. And the argument that says \nIslam and democracy cannot be united is shown to be \nfoolish and patronizing.  \n My country, the Maldives, in some ways was a \nharbinger of the Arab awakening. Our revolution began \neight years ago. Then, in 2008, presidential elections \nbrought peaceful closure to a 30-year authoritarian \nregime. Since then, we have had our difficulties \nconsolidating democracy. There are many hurdles to \novercome. \n But I am pleased to report that in the three years \nsince the elections Maldives is generally stable, safe \nand successful. I do not want to sound complacent. \nDemocracy is a process, not an end goal. Freedoms are \nalways threatened in one way or the other. A successful \ndemocracy requires more than just the separation of \npowers. We also need free media, strong institutions \nand a vibrant civil society. Above all, we need patience \nto realize the fruits that democracy brings. \n Nevertheless, I can report without exaggeration \nthat Maldives enjoys more freedoms today than at any \nother point in our history. I am sure that, with the \nsupport of the United Nations, the peoples of Tunisia, \nEgypt, Libya and other countries will also enjoy \ndemocratic freedoms. \n We must counter the false perception that people \nmust choose between devotion to Islam on the one \nhand, and the full enjoyment of human rights on the \nother. We strongly believe in the compatibility of Islam \nand human rights and seek to do our part to promote \nunderstanding and tolerance. That is why we intend to \norganize, during 2012, a major international conference \non progressive Islamic jurisprudence and human rights. \nWith this conference, we hope to renew the concepts of \npeace and tolerance, coexistence and inter-faith \nharmony in Islam. \n As we watch the changes in the Middle East and \nNorth Africa, it has become even more imperative that \nthe question of Palestine be addressed. The Maldives \nstands shoulder to shoulder with the Palestinian people. \nThe time for Palestine to join the international family \nof nations is long overdue. We therefore welcome its \napplication for statehood. The Maldives calls on all \nMembers to support the recognition of a Palestinian \nState, living side by side and at peace with the State of \nIsrael. While recognizing the rights of the Palestinians, \nwe also value and support the right of the people of \nIsrael to live in peace and security. \n We are proud to announce that last week \nMaldives acceded to the Rome Statute of the \nInternational Criminal Court. Maldives believes that \nhuman rights must be protected at the national and \ninternational levels alike. We are pleased to join a \ngrowing alliance of States that stand firmly against \n  \n \n11-51384 6 \n \nthose who believe they can violate human rights with \nimpunity. In our globalized world, those who trample \nhuman rights or deny basic freedoms will be held \naccountable. I am proud that the Maldives has now \ntaken its rightful place as a defender of international \nlaw and human rights. \n As a small island State, we understand that our \nmeans are modest. Nevertheless, we are proud to \ncontribute to United Nations efforts to promote peace \nand security. In this regard, we are pleased to note that \nfollowing the approval of our Parliament, the Maldives \nis looking forward to becoming engaged for the first \ntime in United Nations peacekeeping efforts around the \nworld. \n As a newly graduated least developed country \n(LDC), we welcome the international support we have \nreceived in our transition. Our graduation from LDC to \nmiddle-income status has not been easy. Based on our \nexperience, I would like to say that the international \ncommunity must continue to help States make a \nsmooth transition from LDC status. We must not allow \ngraduation from LDC status, and the removal of \nsupport that comes with it, to undermine a country\u2019s \nprogress and development. \n The Maldives has spared no effort in highlighting \nthe growing threats posed by climate change. Our \nnation is just one and a half metres above sea level. For \nus, climate change is no vague or abstract menace, but \na clear and present danger to our very existence as a \nnation-State. Over the past year, the world has \nexperienced an increase in natural and man-made \ndisasters, which compels us to address the effects of \nclimate change with more resolutely and urgently. It is \nbecoming increasingly evident that the international \ncommunity needs to be better prepared and equipped to \naddress the challenges of disaster preparedness and \nresponse. \n Cutting global carbon dioxide emissions to a \nsafer level \u2014 below 350 parts per million \u2014 is not just \nan environmental issue. It is also an issue of national \nsecurity. We view the cutting of carbon emissions not \nas a burden but rather as an opportunity \u2014 an \nopportunity not just to protect the climate, but also to \ncreate new jobs and grow our economies. For these \nreasons, Maldives is proud to announce that we will \ndedicate a minimum of 2 per cent of our total \nGovernment revenue to investments in renewable \nenergy.  \n We look forward to the day when the \ninternational community will adopt a legally binding \nclimate treaty. We welcome the incorporation of the \npolitical pledges contained in the Copenhagen Accord \ninto the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change process in Canc\u00fan. In Durban, we look \nforward to helping to advance the process so that we \ncan reach the elusive prize of an agreement that \nprotects the climate and the interests of vulnerable \nnation-States. \n From the very beginning, the sustainable \ndevelopment of small island developing States (SIDS) \nhas been inextricably linked to the Rio process. \nUnfortunately, the objectives defined in the Barbados \nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy have, \nlike the goals expressed in the Rio Declaration on \nEnvironment and Development, gone largely unmet. \n Now, as we set the goals of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development, we must \ninclude in the agenda a serious review of the progress \nmade by the international community in addressing the \nsustainable development challenges facing small island \ndeveloping States. The Maldives hopes that Rio 2012 \nwill provide a platform and create the necessary \nimpetus to radically reform international support for \nSIDS. This should pave the way for establishing a \nSIDS category based on objective, transparent and \nconsistent criteria.  \n We must also analyse and identify the particular \nchallenges and needs of SIDS, which are different from \nthose of other developing countries. We must further \nensure that United Nations programmes are redesigned \nto assist with those particular challenges. Maldives \nbelieves that three issues should form some of the key \npillars to be discussed and acted upon in Rio next year. \nThey are, first, the reform of United Nations support \nfor the sustainable development of SIDS, secondly, a \npolitical declaration and strategy to give impetus to the \nroll-out and mobilization of renewable energy and \ngreen technologies, and lastly, improvements in the \nintegration of sustainable development principles into \ninternational and domestic policy at strategic and \nproject levels alike. \n We are deeply concerned by the dire food crisis \nin the Horn of Africa. As the United Nations, we must \ncome together to find global solutions to these \nchallenges and ensure that we work to protect the \n \n \n7 11-51384 \n \nrights of those who are most vulnerable, especially \nwomen and children.  \n As a country that derives its livelihood from the \nocean, we are also concerned by the growing threat of \npiracy in the Indian Ocean. We will continue to work \nwith the international community in addressing this \ngrowing menace so as to make our maritime areas safe \nfor international shipping and trade. \n The Maldives looks forward to a time when every \ncountry will be democratic, every nation will be free \nand the values that underpin this great institution can \nfinally be realized everywhere. Through the institutions \nof the United Nations, we look forward to continuing \nto promote equity, fairness and the protection of the \nmost vulnerable, regardless of where they live or what \nreligion they practise. \n Only through the United Nations can we hope to \nforge an agreement that protects our climate \u2014 a \nprerequisite for all of our future progress and \ndevelopment. In this volatile and ever-changing world, \nthere is one institution that provides the stability of \ncontinuity, and that is the United Nations. The United \nNations is more important today than ever before."

        "file_text": "Israel has extended its \nhand in peace from the moment it was established \n63 years ago. On behalf of Israel and the Jewish \npeople, I extend that hand again today. I extend it to \nthe people of Egypt and Jordan, with renewed \nfriendship for neighbours with whom we have made \npeace. I extend it to the people of Turkey, with respect \nand goodwill. I extend it to the people of Libya and \nTunisia, with admiration for those trying to build a \ndemocratic future. I extend it to the other peoples of \nNorth Africa and the Arabian peninsula, with whom we \nwant to forge a new beginning. I extend it to the people \nof Syria, Lebanon and Iran, with awe at the courage of \nthose fighting brutal repression.  \n Most especially, I extend my hand to the \nPalestinian people, with whom we seek a just and \nlasting peace. \n In Israel, our hope for peace never wanes. Our \nscientists, doctors and innovators apply their genius to \nimproving the world of tomorrow. Our artists and our \nwriters enrich the heritage of humanity. Now, I know \nthat this is not exactly the image of Israel that is often \nportrayed in this Hall. After all, it was here in 1975 that \nthe age-old yearning of my people to restore our \nnational life in our ancient biblical homeland was \nbranded, shamefully, as racism. It was right here in \n1980 that the historic peace agreement between Israel \nand Egypt was not praised, but denounced. It is here, \nyear after year, that Israel is unjustly singled out for \ncondemnation. It is singled out for condemnation more \noften than all the nations of the world combined. \nTwenty-one out of 27 relevant General Assembly \nresolutions condemn Israel, the one true democracy in \nthe Middle East.  \n This is an unfortunate part of the United Nations \ninstitution. It is the theatre of the absurd. It not only \ncasts Israel as the villain, it often casts real villains in \nleading roles. Al-Qadhafi\u2019s Libya chaired the \nCommission on Human Rights. Saddam\u2019s Iraq headed \nthe Conference on Disarmament.  \n One might say that is the past. Well, here is what \nis happening now \u2014 right now, today. Hizbullah-\ncontrolled Lebanon now presides over the Security \nCouncil. This means, in effect, that a terror \norganization presides over the body entrusted with \nguaranteeing the world\u2019s security. One could not make \nthis up. Here in the United Nations, automatic \nmajorities can decide anything. They can decide that \nthe sun rises in the west. They can also decide \u2014 they \nhave decided \u2014 that the Western Wall in Jerusalem, \nJudaism\u2019s holiest place, is occupied Palestinian \nterritory. \n Yet, even here in the General Assembly, the truth \ncan sometimes break through. In 1984, when I was \nappointed Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations, I \n \n \n37 11-51185 \n \nvisited the great rabbi of Lubavitch. He said to me \u2014 \nand I do not want anyone here to be offended, because \nfrom personal experience of serving here, I know there \nare many honourable men and women, many capable \nand decent people, serving their nations here \u2014 but \nhere is what the rebbe said to me. He said, \u201cYou will be \nserving in a house of many lies\u201d. And then he said, \n\u201cRemember that, even in the darkest place, the light of \na single candle can be seen far and wide\u201d. Today I hope \nthat the light of truth will shine, if only for a few \nminutes, in a Hall that for too long has been a place of \ndarkness for my country.  \n As Israel\u2019s Prime Minister, I did not come here to \nwin applause. I came here to speak the truth. The truth \nis that Israel wants peace. The truth is that I want \npeace. The truth is that in the Middle East, at all times \nbut especially during these turbulent days, peace must \nbe anchored in security. The truth is that we can \nachieve peace not through United Nations resolutions, \nbut only through direct negotiations between the \nparties. The truth is that so far the Palestinians have \nrefused to negotiate. The truth is that Israel wants \npeace with a Palestinian State, but the Palestinians \nwant a State without peace. The truth is that the \nAssembly should not let that happen. \n When I first came here 27 years ago, the world \nwas divided between East and West. Since then, the \nCold War ended, great civilizations have risen from \ncenturies of slumber, hundreds of millions have been \nlifted out of poverty, countless more are poised to \nfollow, and the remarkable thing is that, so far, this \nmonumental historic shift has largely occurred \npeacefully.  \n Yet a malignancy is now growing between East \nand West that threatens the peace of all. It seeks not to \nliberate, but to enslave; not to build, but to destroy. \nThat malignancy is militant Islam. It cloaks itself in the \nmantle of a great faith, yet it murders Jews, Christians \nand Muslims alike with unforgiving impartiality. On \n11 September 2001, it killed thousands of Americans \nand left the twin towers in smouldering ruins. Last \nnight, I laid a wreath on the 9/11 memorial. It was \ndeeply moving. However, as I was going there, one \nthing echoed in my mind: the outrageous words of the \nPresident of Iran at this rostrum yesterday. He implied \nthat 9/11 was an American conspiracy. Some left this \nHall; everyone should have. \n Since 9/11, militant Islamists have slaughtered \ncountless other innocents in London and Madrid, in \nBaghdad and Mumbai, in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and \nin every part of Israel. I believe that the greatest danger \nfacing our world is that this fanaticism will arm itself \nwith nuclear weapons, and that is precisely what Iran is \ntrying to do. Can we imagine that man who ranted here \nyesterday armed with nuclear weapons? \n The international community must stop Iran \nbefore it is too late. If Iran is not stopped, we will all \nface the spectre of nuclear terrorism, and the Arab \nSpring could soon become an Iranian winter. That \nwould be a tragedy. Millions of Arabs have taken to the \nstreets to replace tyranny with liberty, and no one \nwould benefit more than Israel if those committed to \nfreedom and peace would prevail. \n That is my fervent hope, but as the Prime \nMinister of Israel, I cannot risk the future of the Jewish \nState on wishful thinking. Leaders must see reality as it \nis, not as it ought to be. We must do our best to shape \nthe future, but we cannot wish away the dangers of the \npresent. \n The world around Israel is definitely becoming \nmore dangerous. Militant Islam has already taken over \nLebanon and Gaza. It is determined to tear apart the \npeace treaties between Israel and Egypt and between \nIsrael and Jordan. It has poisoned many Arab minds \nagainst Jews and Israel, and against America and the \nWest. It opposes not the policies of Israel but the \nexistence of Israel. \n Now, some argue that if we want to slow down \nthe spread of militant Islam, especially in these \nturbulent times, Israel must hurry to make concessions, \nincluding territorial compromises. And this theory \nsounds simple. Basically it goes like this: leave the \nterritory and peace will be advanced. The moderates \nwill be strengthened; the radicals will be kept at bay. \nAnd do not worry about the pesky details of how Israel \nwill actually defend itself; international troops will do \nthe job. \n These people say to me constantly, \u201cJust make a \nsweeping offer, and everything will work out\u201d. There is \nonly one problem with that theory. We have tried it and \nit has not worked. In 2000, Israel made a sweeping \npeace offer that met virtually all the Palestinian \ndemands. Chairman Arafat rejected it. The Palestinians \nthen launched a terror attack that claimed 1,000 Israeli \nlives. \n  \n \n11-51185 38 \n \n In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert afterwards made \nan even more sweeping offer. President Abbas did not \neven respond to it. But Israel did more than just make \nsweeping offers. We actually left territory. We \nwithdrew from Lebanon in 2000 and from every square \ninch of Gaza in 2005. That did not calm the militant \nIslamic storm that threatens us. It only brought the \nstorm closer and made it stronger. Hizbullah and \nHamas fired thousands of rockets against our cities \nfrom the very territories we had vacated.  \n When Israel left Lebanon and Gaza, the \nmoderates did not defeat the radicals; the moderates \nwere devoured by the radicals. And I regret to say that \ninternational troops, including those of the United \nNations Interim Force in Lebanon and the European \nUnion Border Assistance Mission in Gaza, did not stop \nthe radicals from attacking Israel. \n We left Gaza hoping for peace. We did not freeze \nthe settlements in Gaza; we uprooted them. We did \nexactly what the theory says. We got out, went back to \nthe 1967 borders and dismantled the settlements. I do \nnot think people remember how far we went to achieve \nthis. We uprooted thousands of people from their \nhomes. We pulled children out of their schools and \ntheir kindergartens. We bulldozed synagogues. We \neven moved loved ones from their graves. And then, \nhaving done all that, we gave the keys of Gaza to \nPresident Abbas. \n The theory says that it should have all worked \nout, and that President Abbas and the Palestinian \nAuthority could now build a peaceful state in Gaza. We \nall remember that the entire world applauded our \nwithdrawal as an act of great statesmanship and a bold \nact of peace. But we did not get peace. We got war. We \ngot Iran, which, through its proxy, Hamas, promptly \nkicked out the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian \nAuthority collapsed in a day \u2014 in one day.  \n President Abbas just said from this rostrum that \nthe Palestinians are armed only with their hopes and \ndreams. Yes, they are armed with their hopes, dreams \nand 10,000 missiles and Grad rockets supplied by Iran, \nnot to mention the river of lethal weapons now flowing \ninto Gaza from the Sinai, from Libya and from \nelsewhere. \n Thousands of missiles have already rained down \non our cities. So it might be understand, given all this, \nwhy Israelis rightly ask, \u201cWhat is to prevent this from \nhappening again in the West Bank?\u201d Most of the major \ncities in the south of our country are within a few \ndozen kilometres from Gaza, but in the centre of the \ncountry opposite the West Bank, our cities are a few \nhundred metres or at most a few kilometres from the \nedge of the West Bank. \n So I want to ask: Would anyone here bring danger \nso close to their cities and families? Would they act so \nrecklessly with the lives of their citizens? Israel is \nprepared to have a Palestinian State in the West Bank, \nbut we are not prepared to have another Gaza there. \nAnd that is why we need to have real security \narrangements, which the Palestinians simply refuse to \nnegotiate with us. \n Israelis remember the bitter lessons of Gaza. \nMany of Israel\u2019s critics ignore them. They \nirresponsibly advise Israel to go down this same \nperilous path again. We read what these people say and \nit is as if nothing happened. They just repeat the same \nadvice and the same formulas as though none of this \nhappened. And these critics continue to press Israel to \nmake far-reaching concessions without first assuring \nIsrael\u2019s security. They praise those who unwittingly \nfeed the insatiable crocodile of militant Islam as bold \nstatesmen. They cast as enemies of peace those of us \nwho insist that we must first erect a sturdy barrier to \nkeep the crocodile out, or at the very least jam an iron \nbar between its gaping jaws. \n So in the face of the labels and the libels, Israel \nmust heed better advice. It is better to receive bad press \nthan a good eulogy, and better still would be a fair \npress whose sense of history extends beyond breakfast \nand that recognizes Israel\u2019s legitimate security \nconcerns. I believe that in serious peace negotiations, \nthese needs and concerns can be properly addressed, \nbut they will not be addressed without negotiations.  \n And the needs are many, because Israel is such a \ntiny country. Without Judea and Samaria \u2014 the West \nBank \u2014 Israel is all of nine miles wide. I want to put \nthat in perspective for all of us in this city. It is about \ntwo-thirds the length of Manhattan. It is the distance \nbetween Battery Park and Columbia University. And \nlet us not forget that the people who live in Brooklyn \nand New Jersey are considerably nicer than some of \nIsrael\u2019s neighbours.  \n So how does one protect such a tiny country, \nsurrounded by people sworn to its destruction and \narmed to the teeth by Iran? Obviously, one cannot \ndefend it from within that narrow space alone. Israel \n \n \n39 11-51185 \n \nneeds greater strategic depth, and that is exactly why \nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967) did not require \nIsrael to leave all of the territories it captured in the \nSix-Day War. It talked about withdrawal from \nterritories to secure and defensible boundaries. And to \ndefend itself, Israel must therefore maintain a long-\nterm Israeli military presence in critical strategic areas \nin the West Bank. \n I explained this to President Abbas. He answered \nthat if a Palestinian State was to be a sovereign \ncountry, it could never accept such arrangements. Why \nnot? The United States has had troops in Japan, \nGermany and South Korea for more than a half a \ncentury. Britain has an air base in Cyprus. France has \nforces in three independent African nations. None of \nthose States claim that they are not sovereign countries.  \n There are many other vital security issues that \nalso must be addressed. Take the issue of airspace. \nAgain, Israel\u2019s small dimensions create huge security \nproblems. The United States can be crossed by jet \nairplane in six hours. To fly across Israel, it takes three \nminutes. So is Israel\u2019s tiny airspace to be chopped in \nhalf and given to a Palestinian State not at peace with \nIsrael?  \n Our major international airport is a few \nkilometres from the West Bank. Without peace, will \nour planes become targets for anti-aircraft missiles \nplaced in the adjacent Palestinian State? And how will \nwe stop the smuggling into the West Bank? It is not \nmerely the West Bank; it is the West Bank mountains, \nwhich dominate the coastal plain below where most of \nIsrael\u2019s population sits. How could we prevent the \nsmuggling into those mountains of missiles that could \nbe fired at our cities?  \n I bring up these problems because they are not \ntheoretical problems. They are very real, and for \nIsraelis, they are life-and-death matters. All of these \npotential cracks in Israel\u2019s security have to be sealed in \na peace agreement before a Palestinian State is \ndeclared, not afterwards, because if it is left until \nafterwards they will not be sealed. And these problems \nwill explode in our face and explode the peace.  \n The Palestinians should first make peace with \nIsrael and then get their State. But I also want to say \nthis. After such a peace agreement is signed, Israel will \nnot be the last country to welcome a Palestinian State \nas a new Member of the United Nations. We will be the \nfirst.  \n There is one more thing. Hamas has been \nviolating international law by holding our soldier Gilad \nShalit captive for five years. They have not allowed \neven one Red Cross visit. He is held in a dungeon, in \ndarkness, against all international norms. Gilad Shalit \nis the son of Aviva and Noam Shalit. He is the \ngrandson of Zvi Shalit, who escaped the Holocaust by \ncoming to the land of Israel as a boy in the 1930s. \nGilad Shalit is the son of every Israeli family. Every \nnation represented here should demand his immediate \nrelease. If we want to adopt a resolution about the \nMiddle East today, that is the resolution we should \nadopt.  \n Last year in Israel at Bar-Ilan University, and this \nyear in the Knesset and the United States Congress, I \nlaid out my vision for peace, in which a demilitarized \nPalestinian State recognizes the Jewish State. Yes, the \nJewish State. After all, this is the body that recognized \nthe Jewish State 64 years ago. Now, does the Assembly \nnot think that it is about time that Palestinians did the \nsame?  \n The Jewish State of Israel will always protect the \nrights of all of its minorities, including the more than \n1 million Arab citizens of Israel. I wish I could say the \nsame thing about a future Palestinian State, for as \nPalestinian officials made clear the other day \u2014 in \nfact, I think they did so right here in New York \u2014 the \nPalestinian State would not allow any Jews. They \nwould be Jew-free \u2014 Judenrein. That is ethnic \ncleansing. There are laws today in Ramallah that make \nthe selling of land to Jews punishable by death. That is \nracism. And the Assembly knows which laws this \nevokes.  \n Israel has no intention whatsoever of changing \nthe democratic character of our State. We just do not \nwant the Palestinians to try to change the Jewish \ncharacter of our State. We want them to give up the \nfantasy of flooding Israel with millions of Palestinians.  \n President Abbas just stood here and said that the \nsettlements lie at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflicts. Well, that is odd. Our conflict was raging for \nnearly half a century before there was a single Israeli \nsettlement in the West Bank. So, if what President \nAbbas is saying was true, then I guess that the \nsettlements he is talking about are Tel Aviv, Haifa, \nJaffa and Be?er Sheva. Maybe that is what he meant the \nother day when he said that Israel had been occupying \n  \n \n11-51185 40 \n \nPalestinian land for 63 years. He did not say from \n1967; he said from 1948.  \n I hope that somebody will bother to ask him this \nquestion, because it illustrates a simple truth. The core \nof the conflict is not the settlements; the settlements \nare a result of the conflict. The settlements are an issue \nthat has to be addressed and resolved in the course of \nnegotiations. But the core of the conflict has always \nbeen, and unfortunately remains, the refusal of the \nPalestinians to recognize a Jewish State within any \nborder.  \n I think it is time that the Palestinian leadership \nrecognize what every serious international leader from \nLord Balfour and David Lloyd George in 1917, to \nPresident Truman in 1948, to President Obama just two \ndays ago right here, has recognized \u2014 that Israel is the \nJewish State.  \n I would ask President Abbas to stop walking \naround this issue, recognize the Jewish State, and make \npeace with us. In such a genuine peace, Israel is \nprepared to make painful compromises. We believe that \nthe Palestinians should be neither the citizens of Israel \nnor its subjects. They should live in a free State of their \nown. But they should be ready, like us, for \ncompromise. And we will know that they are ready for \ncompromise and peace when they start taking Israel\u2019s \nsecurity requirements seriously and when they stop \ndenying our historical connection to our ancient \nhomeland. I often hear them accuse Israel of Judaizing \nJerusalem. That is like accusing America of \nAmericanizing Washington, D.C., or the British of \nAnglicizing London. Why are we called Jews? Because \nwe come from Judea.  \n In my office in Jerusalem, there is an ancient \nseal. It is a signet ring of a Jewish official from the \ntime of the Bible. The seal was found right next to the \nWestern Wall and it dates back 2,700 years to the time \nof King Hezekiah. Now, the name of a Jewish official \nis inscribed on the ring in Hebrew. His name was \nNetanyahu. That is my last name. My first name, \nBenjamin, can be traced back a 1,000 years to \nBenjamin \u2014 Binyamin \u2014 the son of Jacob, who was \nalso known as Israel. Jacob and his 12 sons roamed \nthese same hills of Judea and Samaria 4,000 years ago, \nand there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the \nland ever since.  \n Those Jews who were exiled from our land \u2014 \nJews in Spain, on the eve of their expulsion; Jews in \nUkraine, fleeing the pogroms; Jews fighting in the \nWarsaw Ghetto, as the Nazis were circling around it \u2014 \nnever stopped dreaming of coming back. They never \nstopped praying, they never stopped yearning. They \nwhispered: \u201cNext year in Jerusalem. Next year in the \npromised land\u201d.  \n As the Prime Minister of Israel, I speak for a \nhundred generations of Jews who were dispersed \nthroughout the lands and suffered every evil under the \nsun, but who never gave up hope of restoring their \nnational life in the one and only Jewish State.  \n I continue to hope that President Abbas will be \nmy partner in peace. I have worked hard to advance \nthat peace. The day I came into office, I called for \ndirect negotiations without preconditions. President \nAbbas did not respond. I outlined a vision of peace of \ntwo States for two peoples. He still did not respond. I \nremoved hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints to \nease freedom of movement in the Palestinian areas. \nThis facilitated fantastic growth in the Palestinian \neconomy. But again, there was no response. I took the \nunprecedented step of freezing new building in the \nsettlements for 10 months. No Prime Minister had done \nthat before, ever. Once again, I hear applause, but there \nwas no response. No response.  \n In the past few weeks, American officials have \nput forward ideas to restart peace talks. There were \nthings in those ideas about borders that I did not like. \nThere were things there about the Jewish State that I \nam sure the Palestinians did not like. But despite all of \nmy reservations, I was willing to move forward on \nthose American ideas. Why does President Abbas not \njoin me? We have to stop negotiating about the \nnegotiations. Let us just get on with it. Let us negotiate \npeace.  \n I spent years defending Israel on the battlefield. I \nspent decades defending Israel in the court of public \nopinion. President Abbas has dedicated his life to \nadvancing the Palestinian cause. Must this conflict \ncontinue for generations, or will we enable our children \nand our grandchildren to speak in the years ahead of \nhow we found a way to end it? That is what we should \naim for, and that is what I believe we can achieve.  \n In two and a half years, President Abbas and I \nhave met in Jerusalem only once, even though my door \nhas always been open to him. If he wishes, I will come \nto Ramallah. Actually, I have a better suggestion. We \nhave both just flown thousands of miles to New York. \n \n \n41 11-51185 \n \nNow we are in the same city; we are in the same \nbuilding. So let us meet here today, at the United \nNations. Who is there to stop us? What is there to stop \nus? If we genuinely want peace, what is there to stop \nus from meeting today and beginning peace \nnegotiations? \n I suggest that we talk openly and honestly. Let us \nlisten to one another. Let us, as we say in the Middle \nEast, talk dugri. That means \u201cstraightforward\u201d. I will \ntell him my needs and concerns; he will tell me his. \nAnd with God\u2019s help, we will find the common ground \nof peace.  \n There is an old Arab saying that one cannot \napplaud with one hand. Well, the same is true of peace. \nI cannot make peace alone. I cannot make peace \nwithout an interlocutor. President Abbas, I extend my \nhand \u2014 the hand of Israel \u2014 in peace. I hope that he \nwill grasp that hand. We are both the sons of Abraham. \nMy people call him Avraham; his people call him \nIbrahim. We share the same patriarch. We dwell in the \nsame land. Our destinies are intertwined. Let us realize \nthe vision of Isaiah: \u201cThe people who walk in darkness \nwill see a great light\u201d. (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 9:2). Let \nthat light be the light of peace."

        "file_text": "I wish, on \nbehalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and \nNevis, to express gratitude for the honour of addressing \nthe General Assembly. I also extend on their behalf \n \n \n7 11-51378 \n \nsincere congratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdul-Aziz \nAl-Nasser on his election to preside over the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. My delegation also \nwishes to thank Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, for his \nleadership during a very busy and demanding session. \n Our new President\u2019s tenure coincides with a time \nwhen there is on the Assembly\u2019s agenda a confluence \nof global issues with particular relevance for the small \nisland developing States of the Caribbean. \n Most delegations recently participated, for \nexample, in the United Nations High-level Meeting on \nHIV/AIDS, held in June; the United Nations High-\nlevel Meeting on Youth, held in July; and the United \nNations High-level Meeting on Non-communicable \nDiseases, held a few days ago. The convening of those \nmeetings gives ample acknowledgement of the \nchallenges that we still face in our relentless pursuit of \na healthier world, and of the pivotal role of health and \nsocial cohesion as vehicles of national and global \ndevelopment. \n The President has the awesome responsibility of \npiloting us through follow-up actions resulting from \nthose weighty deliberations. My delegation is confident \nof his capacity and experience for the required \nleadership, and assures him of our fullest support. \n The President has declared as his theme for the \nsession \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means\u201d. Certainly, my delegation \nsupports the pacific settlement of disputes, and we \nlikewise acknowledge mediation as a preferred vehicle \nin preventing or settling conflicts. \n In this endeavour, our small island Caribbean \nStates would wish to be engaged in the support \nmechanisms in tangible ways, such as are already laid \nout in the provisions of such landmark resolutions as \nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004), which \naddresses the non-proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. \n The people of my country and my region have \ngreat respect for the idealism that gave birth to this all-\nimportant Organization. Our ideals are indeed \nsynonymous with those of the United Nations system, \nand our expectations are assuredly no less stately than \nthose of large and powerful nations. \n At a time such as this, the United Nations must \nshow its unifying character by assuring that all \nMember States are equipped to play a role in the \nmaintenance of international peace and security and in \nthe building up of one another. We are our brother\u2019s \nkeeper. \n In today\u2019s global community, we must rely \nheavily on collective actions and solid partnerships, if \nwe are to overcome the many common challenges that \nwe face. Among those challenges are the misguided or \nill-considered choices that are made by too many of \nour youth. \n A critical and defining aspect of my country\u2019s \nfuture, and indeed a prospect that will largely define \ntomorrow\u2019s world, is our youth. It is therefore worthy \nof mention that youth violence has attained epidemic \nproportions in the Caribbean. We appreciate that youth \nviolence is invariably symptomatic of deeper \nindividual, community and societal issues, and that a \nmultisectoral, integrated approach is required to \nredress the problem. \n At the national and regional levels, States of the \nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) are actively \ngrappling with this challenge, and we are pleased to \nhave participated in the discussions on this topic at the \nrecent High-level Meeting. There is a need, however, \nto reinforce the fact that there is a role for United \nNations agencies in supporting our efforts to reverse \nthe bothersome trend of youth violence, with all its \nimplications for many critical sectors, including \nsecurity, health and development. \n Accordingly, we shall be heightening our \nengagement with WHO, UN-HABITAT, UNICEF and \nother relevant United Nations and international \ndevelopment agencies in this endeavour. \n The challenge of youth violence is also linked, to \nsome extent, to the proliferation of small arms and \nlight weapons. While my country acknowledges the \nstrides made in our region with respect to small arms \nand light weapons, through the recent adoption of the \nCARICOM Declaration on Small Arms and Light \nWeapons, there is still a long way to go. It is \nimperative, therefore, that we work together to bring a \nsolution-focused approach to the problem of easy \naccess to small arms and light weapons in our \ncountries. CARICOM here calls for an arms trade \ntreaty. \n Related to this challenge is the issue of human \nsecurity and development. My country is committed to \n  \n \n11-51378 8 \n \nworking diligently at the national and regional levels, \nand to collaborating internationally, to improve the \nlives of our people. \n Saint Kitts and Nevis is a relatively small \ncountry, and it is usually the small and vulnerable that \nare most severely impacted when global shocks and \ncrises occur. That is why, as a region, we promote \ncollective action to enhance our resilience, promote \nhuman security, lessen our vulnerability and build \nstronger economies. \n Such has been our widely acclaimed best-practice \napproach with regard to HIV/AIDS. Saint Kitts and \nNevis applauds the General Assembly for convening \nthe High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS. The Joint \nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) \nhas collaborated with the Pan Caribbean Partnership \nAgainst HIV and AIDS, in keeping with its \ncommitment to support countries achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals and also in ensuring \nthat HIV prevention, care, treatment and support \nservices are provided to all in need. \n The agenda is still a full one and the challenge no \nless daunting than it was 10 years ago, in a region with \nthe second highest global prevalence rate of HIV. We \ntherefore anticipate and encourage the continued \nsupport of UNAIDS and other health and development \nagencies. \n With regard to non-communicable diseases \n(NCDs), the Caribbean can be justly proud that the \ninitiatives in the Port of Spain Declaration of 2007 \u2014 \n\u201cUniting to Stop the Epidemic of Chronic NCDs\u201d \u2014 \nwhich arose out of the first-ever heads of Government \nsummit on the subject, has resonated across the globe, \nresulting in the just concluded High-level Meeting with \na consensus on launching an international wellness \nrevolution. \n Non-communicable diseases are to a large extent \npreventable. It is therefore essential that the outcome \ndocument from the High-level Meeting mirrors many \nof the chief concerns of the Port of Spain Declaration, \naimed at encouraging Governments and the private \nsector to collaborate on increasing avenues for \nexercise, healthy diets and smoke-free zones for the \nbenefit of the general public. \n A long-term reduction in the enormous costs of \ntreating heart failure, diabetes and hypertension, and \nthe resulting 60 per cent to 70 per cent mortality rates \nfrom NCDs, is worth the investment in protecting \nhuman capital and the development of our various \nregions. \n I am extremely proud that the Government of \nSaint Kitts and Nevis has the lead responsibility for \nhuman resources, health and HIV/AIDS in the \nCaribbean Community, and continues to play a \npioneering role. \n We recognize the urgent need to make good on \npledges resulting from the High-level Meeting, which \ncan only augur well for a future in which due \nrecognition must be given to the role of health in \noverall development. \n It would be remiss of me not to highlight the \nsignificance of the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development. Next June, during this sixty-\nsixth session of the General Assembly, all eyes will be \non the Rio deliberations aimed at achieving \nconvergence on the social, environmental and \neconomic dimensions of sustainable development. I \nfully support the main objective of the Conference, \nnamely, securing political commitment. That is the \ncritical factor for success throughout the Rio+20 \nprocesses and beyond. \n Saint Kitts and Nevis is one of the small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS) referred to in chapter 17 of \nAgenda 21. Throughout the past 20 years, the \ninternational community has made tremendous strides \nin addressing SIDS challenges to sustainable \ndevelopment. Regrettably, many an encouraging step \nforward has been offset by painful setbacks. \n The effect of climate change is a bane that is felt \non a daily basis in Saint Kitts and Nevis, as in other \nislands. The question is no longer \u201cif\u201d and \u201chow\u201d, but \nrather \u201cwhen\u201d and \u201cby how much\u201d we will be affected. \nWe need desperately to upgrade pre-emptive measures, \nto counter the imminent threat of climate change. \n A defined strategy to aggressively promote \nclimate financing is highly recommended. It will be \nvital if our countries are to successfully address the \neffects of climate change without tapping into already \nlimited and depleted resources. My delegation \nencourages other Member States to join the call for the \nfull implementation of climate financing. \n In addition to pursuing outcomes that benefit all \nStates, my delegation would like to highlight certain \nchallenges that some members of the international \n \n \n9 11-51378 \n \ncommunity face, with which the General Assembly can \nassist. I speak of Haiti, Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba and \nTaiwan. \n We must ever remember Haiti, one of the most \npopulous member States of CARICOM. We should \nremain acutely aware of Haiti\u2019s trials and struggles \nagainst natural and man-made catastrophic events, \nunsettling social and political vicissitudes and \neconomic hardships. Their effects have set Haiti many \nyears behind, compared to the rate of development of \nother nations in the region. We therefore encourage the \nfulfilling of the many goodwill pledges that have been \nmade for assistance in its reconstruction efforts. \n Another CARICOM member State, Antigua and \nBarbuda, continues to be locked in an underdog \nstruggle to benefit from its success before the World \nTrade Organization Dispute Settlement Body. We again \nurge a speedy, fair and just resolution to this gaming \ndispute. \n Also within the Caribbean, the people of our \nsister nation of Cuba continue to endure much hardship \nas the consequence of a 50-year commercial, economic \nand financial embargo. The Assembly and the \ninternational community have consistently called for \nthe lifting of the embargo. Our country reiterates its \ncall, and the call of regional neighbours and the \ninternational community, particularly the General \nAssembly, for a speedy redress of this matter. \n Since 2009, Taiwan has been invited by the World \nHealth Organization to attend the annual World Health \nAssembly (WHA) as an observer. This practice and the \nrelated arrangements have established what has been \ntermed the WHA model, which sets a useful precedent \nfor Taiwan\u2019s greater participation in the United Nations \nsystem. It is the view of my country that in today\u2019s \nhighly integrated and interconnected world almost all \nissues demand full participation by, and cooperation \namong, international partners. As one of the world\u2019s \nleading economic and technological powerhouses, \nTaiwan can contribute substantially to the international \ncommunity. \n We therefore urge the United Nations to find a \nsuitable way to allow for Taiwan\u2019s meaningful \nparticipation in its specialized agencies and \nmechanisms, including the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization and the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. \n I have presented some of the challenges that we \nencounter as a country and region, challenges to which \nthe Assembly has itself given prominence. I have also \ngiven consideration to some of our aspirations for the \nsixty-sixth session and beyond. They are issues that \ndemand collective inputs and interventions. \n We are all part of the global community, and \nproblems that permeate our tightly woven fabric \ninvariably spread to affect us all in some way or \nanother. It is incumbent upon us all, therefore, to \nensure that the results of our collective enterprise and \ndiligence allow for the realization of our desired goals. \nSurely, working together with purpose and integrity \nwill ensure that we rise on the same tide. Let us rise \ntogether."

        "file_text": "Vanuatu joins other \ndelegations in congratulating you, Mr. President, on \nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at \nits sixty-sixth session. My delegation vows our full \ncooperation, and believes that, with your leadership, \nwe will conclude a successful session. \n \n \n9 11-51372 \n \n Allow me to also acknowledge the leadership of \nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for \nhis exceptional guidance and for the considerable and \nimportant achievements of the previous Assembly \nsession. \n In the same spirit, on behalf of my Government, I \ntake this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency \nBan Ki-moon on his re-election to the post of \nSecretary-General and to commend him on his vision, \nleadership and tireless efforts in moving towards \nachieving the common interests of all humanity. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the Government and the people of the \nRepublic of South Sudan on the birth of their new \nnation on 9 July. Vanuatu recognizes the sovereignty of \nSouth Sudan, and offers the young nation our full \nsupport.  \n The theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \nsession, \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means\u201d, calls for more creative \nand feasible peaceful multilateral solutions to many of \nour long-standing disputes that, unless resolved \npeacefully, will have far more extensive global \nconsequences. The settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans is central to the United Nations system, as \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and in \nnumerous international conventions and treaties. In that \ncontext, we, like many others, encourage our brothers \nand sisters in Israel and Palestine to continue the \npeaceful negotiations that will ensure regional and \nglobal stability. We also call upon the United Nations \nto visit the framework with which it fulfils its \nmediation mandates and to develop closer partnerships \nwith mediation actors within regional groups. To \nsucceed as responsible nations of this global village, \nwe must continue to cultivate an environment that \nthwarts the seeds of bitterness, hatred and vengeance. \n In establishing the United Nations in 1945, many \nnations, great and small, entrusted it with the \nresponsibility to assist in maintaining international \npeace and security, developing friendly relations \namong nations, and promoting social progress, better \nliving standards and human rights. However, 66 years \nafter the founding of this multilateral Organization, the \nworld that we live in is far from the ideals for which its \ninception was intended. Across the globe, people from \nall walks of life continue to be subject to colonial rule, \ndeath threats, arbitrary detention, torture and worse, \nand are killed for exercising their rights to freedom of \nexpression. Untold crimes against humanity and other \nhuman rights atrocities still continue. \n While we reaffirm our faith in multilateralism, \nwith the conviction that bilateral diplomacy cannot \nsubstitute for multilateralism, we also believe that our \nnations have a greater need of a more robust \nmultilateral system that is swift and efficient in \nresponding to the multitude of challenges that members \nof this highly esteemed system, acting unilaterally, \nwould be hard done to defeat. We are delighted to note \nthat one of the four priorities of the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session is to \ncontinue the work on the reforms within the United \nNations. \n In that context, this year\u2019s establishment of the \nChange Management Team within the Organization, in \nparticular, is a step in the right direction. That initiative \ncomes at a time when members of this body are calling \non the United Nations to play a more prominent role in \na period of rapid change and financial restraint in \nbuilding a culture of transparency, accountability, good \ngovernance and enhanced democratic participation, and \nto achieve efficiency and results. \n As regards the Security Council, Vanuatu is \nsteadfast in its belief that reform measures must \nprovide for democratic and geographically strategic \nrepresentation in both the permanent and the \nnon-permanent membership to reflect the realities of \nthis century. We continue to lend our invaluable \nsupport to the candidacies of the many countries vying \nfor membership within the non-permanent seat \ncategory of the Security Council. We hope that \nsustained reforms will help to boost the Security \nCouncil\u2019s peacekeeping role and to increase efficiency \nand transparency in promoting the universal standards \nand common values and customs that form the basis of \nglobal security and development. At this juncture, let \nme acknowledge the work of the peacekeeping and \nnation-building missions of the United Nations in \nsupporting new countries, such as Timor-Leste, South \nSudan and others, in their nation-building. \n On 9 September 2011, we marked the tenth \nanniversary of the twin towers bombing that wreaked \nhavoc in the city of New York and claimed more than \n3,000 lives. Such acts of terrorism can never be \njustified, whatever the causes they claim to be \n  \n \n11-51372 10 \n \nadvancing and to whatever grievances they claim to \nrespond. \n Despite international efforts to counter terrorism, \nmajor threats remain. Indeed, the world cannot sit idly \nby, watching the forces of evil threaten humanity\u2019s \nright to peace and security. Terrorism cannot and must \nnot be allowed to flourish. Vanuatu condemns, in the \nstrongest possible terms, all forms and manifestations \nof terrorism, and calls on all countries to join forces to \nfight against its evil ideologies, activities and financing \nin order to make the world of tomorrow a safer place. \nAll countries must work closely in eliminating that \nscourge. \n Today, the lack of progress on disarmament and \nnon-proliferation, cornerstones of global security, is \ndisturbing. The world\u2019s nuclear Powers must fulfil \ntheir vows to meet their obligations under the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to take \ndecisive and practical steps towards irreversible \ndisarmament. Only then will the proliferation of arms \nreverse. \n My people welcome the strenuous efforts of \nPresident Obama and other world leaders, working \ntogether at the vanguard to advance negotiations on \ndenuclearization. The very recent events in Japan\u2019s \nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster clearly show that \nwhatever safeguards are in place, there can be no \nabsolute guarantee that those can withstand the \nunforgivable ferocity of Mother Nature. They are \nimportant lessons for us. \n Four years after the global financial crisis began, \nin 2007, the economies of many developed countries \ncontinue to struggle, stirring financial markets \nworldwide with fresh fears of impediments, default and \npossible recession. For small developing countries, \nsuch as Vanuatu, the rise in food prices, high fuel costs, \nsoaring commodity prices, fears of a global recession, \nas well as the other unforeseen effects of the global \nfinancial instability and uncertainty that remain in \nmany developed countries, are having multifaceted \nconsequences. \n Such developments, coupled with the ongoing \neffects of climate change and natural disasters, \ncontinue to threaten the economies of small island \nnations, and to undermine all efforts towards the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) to ensure that \nsustainable development is achieved. \n Vanuatu has made some progress towards \nachieving the MDGs, but much more needs to be done \nby pooling our own resources at the national level and \nby engaging the international community in \ncoordinating efforts so as to achieve our MDGs. \n The convening of this year\u2019s thematic group on \nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) is indeed timely. \nIn my country, it is estimated that approximately 75 per \ncent of deaths each year are related to NCDs. \nFurthermore, the immediate causes of the NCD \nepidemic \u2014 tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical \ninactivity and the harmful use of alcohol \u2014 are \nbecoming increasingly widespread in our society, \nespecially in urban areas. Those self-inflicted diseases \nare, therefore, becoming a major barrier to our socio-\neconomic development and to achieving healthy \nislands and the MDGs.  \n At this point in time, my country is undertaking, \nfor the first time, a national NCD STEPS survey to \ndetermine and to better understand the burden and the \nextent of NCDs and their determinants in our \ncommunities so that we can better target our \nintervention efforts in future. Early this year, Vanuatu \nlaunched its revised NCD strategy and policy for the \nperiod 2011 to 2016 to guide our implementation \nefforts in the coming years. We have also implemented, \nover the years, many key NCD strategies to empower \nour people to increase control over their health and its \ndeterminants, with the assistance of our development \npartners, such as the World Health Organization, the \nAustralian Agency for International Development and \nthe Secretariat of the Pacific Community. \n In terms of economic performance, Vanuatu\u2019s \neconomy grew at an unprecedented average rate of \n6 per cent between 2003 and 2008. Economic growth \nhas since weakened, mainly as a result of exogenous \nshocks felt during the ongoing global financial crisis. \nThat has had a negative impact on Government revenue \nin the past few years, adding further strain on the \neconomy. That said, the need for significant increases \nin financial support from development partners remains \npressing. The announcement of a considerable increase \nin credit facilities at the Group of Twenty London \nsummit in 2009 was welcome news. However, the \nreassertion of those financial commitments and swift \naction need to be rigorously followed up by the donor \ncommunity. \n \n \n11 11-51372 \n \n The previous assessment by the United Nations \nCommittee for Development Policy of Vanuatu\u2019s \ndevelopment status as a least developed country has \nshowed a progressive pace in development. While \ngraduation may be imminent, I must underscore, before \nthe Assembly, that most challenges of the small island \ndeveloping States are permanent. The challenges of \nsmallness, the distance to major metropolitan markets, \nextreme vulnerability to natural disasters and climate \nchange, the sea-level rise and vulnerability to tsunamis \nall constitute permanent characteristics of our island \nnations. It is therefore important for the United Nations \nto ensure that multilateral mechanisms for graduation \nand a transition package must not be detached from \nthose permanent realities. We are delighted that the \nPresident of the General Assembly has vowed to pay \nspecial attention to vulnerable States such as ours. \n Climate change and ocean acidification remain \nthe single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security \nand well-being of the peoples of the Pacific, \nparticularly for small low-lying Pacific islands. High \ngreenhouse gas emitting industrialized countries must \nstart to embrace and to accept the common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities in historic contributions \nto climate change. \n As the former Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, \nI, along with my fellow leaders of the Pacific Island \nnations, particularly welcome the historic visit of \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Pacific. I call \non the United Nations to undertake more senior \nmissions to the Pacific region so as to establish a more \ncomprehensive understanding of how susceptible the \npeople of the Pacific are to the adverse impacts of \nclimate change and sea-level rise, as embodied by the \ncase of Kiribati. \n I call on leaders of advanced nations to renew and \nhonour their pledges to finance, in particular, efforts to \nhelp the most vulnerable communities to address their \nadaptation needs in order to ensure that island nations \nsurvive the impending global disaster that climate \nchange may afford. An increased global fund to \nstrengthen the capacity-building efforts of vulnerable \ncommunities, in particular, to integrate climate change \ninto economic policies and actions, is pressing. \n As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties \nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (COP 17) talks in Durban, my \nGovernment urges all delegations to work tirelessly to \npledge to a second commitment period of the Kyoto \nProtocol. Durban must advance all aspects of the \nclimate change negotiations and devise strategies to \noperationalize the COP 16 decisions if any concrete, \nbalanced and ambitious outcomes are to yield results. \n Colonialism and all forms of imperialism must be \naddressed by the United Nations, for one of the reasons \nwhy the United Nations system was created was to \ndevelop friendly relations among nations, based on \nrespect for the principles of equal rights and the self-\ndetermination of peoples. Therefore, colonial rule is \nobsolete and must be addressed with new drive and \nvision. The United Nations, as well as the international \ncommunity, must continue in their efforts to address \nissues of decolonization in those Non-Self-Governing \nTerritories that still yearn for freedom.  \n The mandate of the Special Committee on \nDecolonization must be strengthened. All means should \nbe accorded to the Committee to allow it to magnify \nthe suppressed voices of the peoples in all Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories that are still under the control of \nadministrative Powers, especially where serious human \nrights violations are reported. \n My country, Vanuatu, was the last in the Pacific \nregion to be decolonized. Since our independence in \n1980, we have continued to speak out for the \ninalienable rights of the colonized indigenous peoples \nof Oceania and in certain parts of the Asian region, \nwhere either administrative or colonial Powers still \nretain authority. \n My Government also calls upon the United \nNations to ensure that the demands for French \nPolynesia\u2019s right to self-determination are not rejected. \nWe, along with many other Pacific island nations, \nsupport calls for the reinstatement of the French-\nadministered Territory with the United Nations Special \nCommittee on Decolonization. That would be the first \nmajor step in the process of their self-determination. \nVanuatu encourages the French-administered Territory \nof French Polynesia and, in the same spirit, that of \nNew Caledonia to continue to seek meaningful \ndialogue with France in order to find ways to ensure \nthat the freedom of the colonized peoples of Oceania is \nfully realized. \n Enshrined in the core principles of the United \nNations Charter, the Organization must guarantee \nuniversal respect for the human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms of all the oppressed. The universal pursuit of \n  \n \n11-51372 12 \n \ndemocratic reform, good governance and adherence to \nhuman rights conventions have often concealed the \nsuffering of many people, denying them their right to \ndecide their destiny without fear or reprisal. The \nUnited Nations must step up its efforts to exercise their \nfreedom from the tentacles of foreign rule, so \ntroublesome a misgiving in these modern times. \n One day, all the indigenous peoples of Oceania \nand beyond must reach their goal of freedom, a \ndestination promised to all humanity and a right that \nthe Creator endowed upon all peoples and that no \nearthly Power can deny, to determine where they live \nand to be self-ruled in free association with the \ninternational community of nations. \n Let me take this opportunity once again to \nreiterate to this eminent Assembly our serious concerns \nover the infringement by foreign forces on the political \nfreedom of many of our nations today, a right denied to \nthe people of the land to exercise their freedom to \ncontrol their lands, a freedom denied by the injustices \nof the global world order that demarcated many of our \nlands, dividing peoples, families and cultures and \ndisconnecting us from the traditions of our ancestors. \nDenying the right of a country to exercise its political \nfreedom over its maritime territorial boundaries and \npreventing the indigenous people of a country from \nexercising their culture and traditional linkages with \nintegral part of its lands, sovereign since time \nimmemorial, remain one of the greatest crimes of our \ntimes. We are therefore calling on the United Nations \nto ensure that our fundamental rights can be exercised \nin all parts of our territory. \n As the world unites in addressing some of the \nmajor challenges of our times, the lifting of the \neconomic embargo on Cuba is long overdue. Denying \nthe good people of Cuba from fully participating in the \nglobal economy is inhumane. T is high time that the \nCuban people be allowed to enjoy their rights and \nfreedom as an independent and sovereign nation. \n It is time that we all revisit the aspirations and the \nideals with which the United Nations system was \ncreated and join forces to weed out injustice, \ncolonialism, poverty, hunger, war crimes, terrorism and \nthe like in the hope of creating a peaceful and secure \nworld for generations to come. All nations, great and \nsmall, must respect each other\u2019s sovereignty, for that is \nthe way to achieve trust and to ensure a dignified \nconfidence among all friends gathered around the table \nof the United Nations. \n I also welcome Fiji\u2019s commitment to full and \ndemocratic elections by September 2014. As a Pacific \nneighbour, such as announcement is timely. \n In conclusion, I wish to take this final \nopportunity to express my gratitude to Vanuatu\u2019s \ndevelopment partners for the support that they provide \nin building our economy. I believe that more can be \ndone to help small vulnerable island countries like \nVanuatu to address the rising challenges confronting \nthem. \n Leaders of the world, the resounding echoes of \nhistory drum in our ears and remind us of what must be \ndone tomorrow. The global forces driving the changes \nthat will shape our future must beckon towards a world \nwhere people of all races, ethnicities, creeds, beliefs, \nfaiths, cultures, traditions and origins can live in \nharmony and peace, as brothers and sisters."

        "file_text": "I am pleased to welcome the Government of \nSouth Sudan as a State Member of the United Nations. \nI also join the appeal by all African leaders for an \nurgent, effective and international response to the \nfamine in the Horn of Africa. \n While we are engaged in debate here, in Libya \nanother preventive war is taking place under the \npretext of protecting civilians. The United States and \nNATO, supposedly to avoid a massacre, launched a \nmilitary attack against a sovereign State without there \nbeing any threat whatsoever to international peace and \nsecurity. They unleashed a regime change operation. \nNATO imposed on the Security Council a dubious \nresolution authorizing  \n \u201cMember States \u2026 acting nationally or through \nregional organizations or arrangements \u2026 to take \nall necessary measures \u2026 to protect civilians and \ncivilian populated areas under threat of attack\u201d \n(resolution 1973 (2011), para. 4). \n Afterwards, NATO violated this same resolution \nin order to supply weapons, provide financing to one \nparty and deploy operatives and diplomatic personnel \non the ground. Now everybody has a better \nunderstanding of what the concept of responsibility to \nprotect means and how it can be used. In this war, in \naddition to the most advanced and lethal military \ntechnologies, the means of communication have been \nused as weapons of war by financial and media \nbusinesses, which are profiteering from the war and the \nreconstruction operations, as if they were agents of \ncrisis containment. \n As early as 21 February, Commander-in-Chief \nFidel Castro Ruz warned that NATO was irrevocably \npreparing a war against Libya. Since then, Cuba has \nengaged indefatigably in the defence not of a \nGovernment but of a principle. It is unacceptable to \nassassinate thousands of innocent people under the \ndubious purpose of protecting other civilians. History \nhas eloquently demonstrated that peace cannot be \nimposed either by war or by force. It is up to the \nLibyan people alone to choose their destiny, without \nforeign intervention, in the exercise of their right to \nself-determination, independence and sovereignty over \ntheir natural resources and their country\u2019s territorial \nintegrity. \n The military intervention in Libya and the \ngrowing threat against Syria have been the \nopportunistic, defensive responses of the United States \nand Europe to the collapse of their system of \ndomination and plunder in North Africa and the Middle \nEast and to the emergence of genuinely popular \nmovements in Tunisia, Egypt and other countries, in \norder to secure huge reserves of oil and water and to \nconfiscate financial assets in times of global economic \nand social crisis. It is the responsibility of the General \nAssembly to exercise its full powers to prevent a \nmilitary aggression against Syria. The public should be \nhave objective information and speak up against war. \n President Barack Obama, in his threatening, \ndeceitful, rhetorical speeches of 20 and 21 September, \ndescribed what happened in Libya as a new model. He \nsaid,  \n \u201cThis is how the international community should \nwork in the twenty-first century. More nations are \nassuming the responsibility and the costs of \nmeeting global challenges. In fact, this is the very \npurpose of the United Nations. So every nation \nrepresented here today can take pride in the \ninnocent lives we saved and in helping Libyans \nreclaim their country. It was the right thing to \ndo.\u201d  \n A top White House official wrote in Foreign \nAffairs magazine that the new United States strategy is \nmore efficient and less costly. The Bush Administration \nstrategy considered occupation; the Obama Administration \nstrategy is that of national liberation. The military \nintervention strategy in Libya could also be applied in \nother cases. \n With absolute cynicism, what is proposed is a \nmilitary aggression without casualties or the use of \ninfantry troops, the costs of which would be mainly \nborne by Europe. The destabilization of a country \n  \n \n11-51390 14 \n \nthrough subversion, covert operations and economic \nsanctions is described, according to this doctrine, as \nthe development of a national movement. That new \nregime-change operations model shows that current \nUnited States and NATO military doctrines are even \nmore aggressive than their previous ones, and that the \nso called Euro-Atlantic periphery comprises the entire \nplanet. \n No one should doubt that Latin America and the \nCaribbean are included in that concept. The \nredeployment of the Fourth Fleet, the installation of \nAmerican bases, troops and military means to intervene \nanywhere in the region, the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against \nVenezuela in 2002, followed by an oil coup, the \nsedition in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, the military coup in \nHonduras and the attempted coup in Ecuador all fit \nperfectly in the new strategy. \n Can the United States and NATO guarantee today \nthat the use of force and this concept of regime change \ndo not apply in the case of Latin American and \nCaribbean countries that do not submit to their \ninterests? Can the European Union say something \nabout it? What would the United Nations do in such a \nsituation? \n The weakness of the global economy, particularly \nthe economies of the United States and Europe, \ncontinues to show that the economic crisis that began \nin the year 2008 has not yet been overcome. In \ndeveloped countries, the terrible burden of its \nconsequences is borne by workers, the unemployed, \nimmigrants and the poor, who are brutally repressed \nwhenever they peacefully defend their rights. \n We, the countries of the South, repeatedly \nplundered, suffer the distortions of a world economic \norder that excludes our legitimate interests. We suffer \nunder the onerous impact of protectionism and the \nsteady increase in the prices of foodstuffs and \nhydrocarbons. The peoples of many developing \ncountries are victims of the bankrupt neoliberal \neconomic model and its sequel of plunder and \nexclusion. The social and political consequences are \nbeing felt on all continents. \n In the face of a global economic crisis and the \ndepletion of the planet\u2019s natural resources, what will be \nthe response of the extremist right-wing forces that are \nalready in power or may come to power as a result of \nthe afflictions and hopelessness of voters? In the face \nof a growing and universal danger of war, of a new \ndivision of the world and of climate change, could we, \nthe countries of the South, act together as an essential \ncondition of our salvation?  \n In the face of so many serious threats, Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean \u2014 the region of Bol\u00edvar \nand Mart\u00ed \u2014 is coming together, determined to finish \nwhat they left unfinished. It is impossible to divide us \nor to turn us against each other. The Bolivarian \nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America is a small but \nmorally powerful group of peoples, and the new \nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States is \na fact. The full strength of the Andes will very soon be \nexpressed in a summit, which will be an epoch-making \nevent in Caracas \u2014 the epicentre of independence in \nthe Americas, where a Bolivarian people has conquered \npower and a continental leader, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \nFr\u00edas, is ever growing. \n More than ever, we have to defend the United \nNations, but the biggest challenge will be to turn it into \nan organization that serves the legitimate interests of \nall States, instead of catering to the arbitrary wishes \nand abuses of a few rich and powerful countries. We \nmust see to it that international law and the purposes \nand principles of the United Nations Charter prevail in \nthe face of the brute force that aims to block them. It is \nnecessary to re-establish the leading role of the General \nAssembly and to recast the Security Council.  \n The General Assembly has the inescapable moral, \npolitical and legal obligation to ensure the recognition \nof an independent Palestinian State, with the \nboundaries established before 1967 and with East \nJerusalem as its capital, as a full Member of the United \nNations. This should be accomplished with or without \nthe Security Council, with or without the veto of the \nUnited States and with or without new peace \nnegotiations. \n If the inalienable right of the Palestinian people \nto independence, sovereignty and self-determination is \nrecognized; if the need to re-establish the exercise of \nthe human rights of Palestinians is recognized; if the \nblockade of Gaza, the economic coercion and \nsegregation symbolized by the infamous wall are \nrecognized as crimes; if the subjugation of a nation to \nconditions jeopardizing its very existence is described \nas genocide; if all Member States are supposed to \nadopt all legal measures within their reach to protect \nPalestinian civilians, then the General Assembly should \ntake action now. \n \n \n15 11-51390 \n \n Cuba, a country with a small Jewish community, \ncondemns the historical injustice of anti-Semitism, the \ncrime against humanity that was the Holocaust, and \nrecognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist. Our \npeople harbour only fraternal feelings towards the \nIsraeli people, who are also victims of this conflict. \n Cuba likewise proclaims that the United States \nhas the moral, political and legal obligation to stop its \ncontinual veto of Security Council resolutions intended \nto protect the Palestinian civilians. \n The European Union should oppose this veto and \nabstain from supporting the empire\u2019s brutal pressure on \nmembers of this Assembly and the Council itself. \nEurope should denounce it also because it is certain \nthat those crimes would not be occurring without the \nmilitary supplies, financial support and impunity that \nthe United States provides to the Government of Israel. \n On 11 September 2001, we Cubans shared the \npain of the American people at those atrocious terrorist \nacts. We offered selfless solidarity, encouragement and \ncooperation. As always, Cuba made crystal-clear \nstatements against terrorism and against war. \n Ten years later, the world is even more insecure, \nbecause instead of turning international consensus \nagainst terrorism into a system of international \ncooperation to confront it, the United States invaded \nand occupied Iraq and Afghanistan, causing the loss of \nlife of hundreds of thousands of persons and pain to \ntens of millions. It was not possible to hide the use of \ndeception, torture, extrajudicial executions or \nassassinations, disappearances of individuals, arbitrary \ndetentions and the secret renditions and prisons of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency in Europe and other \nregions. \n The Government of the United States desecrates \nthe memory of the victims of 11 September when it \ncontinues the prolonged inhumane imprisonment of the \nfive Cuban anti-terrorist fighters who were unjustly \ncondemned, in spurious trials, to sentences of \nmaximum severity for seeking information about the \nterrorist activities of groups that have operated with \nabsolute impunity from United States territory against \nCuba, leading to the death of or physical harm to 5,577 \nof our citizens. Once again, with all due respect, I urge \nPresident Obama to make use of his powers to release \nthem as an act of justice or as a humanitarian gesture, \nwhich would be highly appreciated by their children, \nwives, mothers, fathers and all of our people. \n The Cuban Government reiterates its interest and \nwillingness to move towards the normalization of \nrelations with the United States. Today I reiterate the \nproposal to begin a dialogue aimed at solving bilateral \nproblems, including humanitarian issues, as well as our \noffer to negotiate several cooperation agreements \nconcerning drug-trafficking, terrorism, human \nsmuggling, natural disasters and protection of the \nenvironment, including in the event of oil spills such as \nthe one that occurred at the British Petroleum platform \nin the Gulf of Mexico. \n However, we know that the electoral race has \nalready begun in this country, while the economic \nsituation is growing worse. \n The economic, commercial and financial \nblockade of Cuba has been tightened. The damages it \nhas caused have totalled $975 billion, based on the \ncurrent price of gold. The attempt to subvert the \nconstitutional order that Cubans have freely elected is \nintensifying. There is increasing pressure from the \nextreme right and the Cuban-American mafia to \nreverse the minimal steps adopted by the American \nGovernment to promote, to some degree, links between \nCuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s and their home country and exchanges \nbetween both peoples. \n In Cuba, President Ra\u00fal Castro Ruz has reiterated \nthat we will continue, in our own sovereign way, to \nchange everything that needs to be changed in order to \nmake our economy more efficient and our socialism \nbetter, to achieve full justice and to be able to fully \npreserve our independence. \n As Mart\u00ed said, \u201cThe southern sea will join the sea \nof the north and a serpent will hatch from the egg of an \neagle before we cease our struggle to make the \nhomeland free and prosperous.\u201d"

        "file_text": "How \ncan we shape development policy that is of benefit to \nall? The per capita gross domestic product of \nSwitzerland is 130 times higher than that of a country \nsuch as Mozambique. Why do the poorest countries \nbenefit so little from globalization, and what can we do \nto change this? One-quarter of the world\u2019s population \nconsumes three-quarters of the available raw materials. \nHow can we ensure that nearly 7 billion individuals \nhave enough water, food and energy at affordable \nprices? And what happened to equity and social justice \nin the twenty-first century? \n It is up to us together to find the answers to these \nquestions. That will require us to have a sense of \nresponsibility and to be ready to reflect together on \nnorms, values and priorities. \n More than any other international organization, \nthe United Nations has the potential and the necessary \n  \n \n11-50692 50 \n \nconditions to support States in these efforts. Since its \nfounding, the United Nations has developed into a \ndense institutional network. International governance \nremains fragmented and inefficient. Governance \nstructures need to be strengthened if the United \nNations is to succeed as the driving force towards \nsustainable development. \n Events in the Arab world have been a reminder \nthat democracy and sustainable development go hand \nin hand. Indeed, it was ultimately the lack of political \nfreedom, combined with injustice and a lack of \neconomic prospects, that unleashed the fundamental \nchanges that have so surprised us. Many nations are \nfacing difficult changes today and the fact that \nrelations among States and between the region and the \nrest of the world need to be based on new principles. \nThis is a challenge to the countries themselves and to \nthe new social groups driving the change: youth, \nwomen, the emerging middle classes and civil society \nas a whole. But it is also a challenge to the countries \nand Governments of the region, as well as for us all as \nMembers of the United Nations. \n We must do our best to ensure that effective aid is \nprovided quickly to the victims of unrest and violence. \nWe must ensure that security and the rule of law are \nstrengthened. We must contribute to inclusive political \ndialogue, promoting national reconciliation and \nlegitimate efforts to create new constitutions. We must \nextend the authority of State institutions and restore \npublic services. We must help to protect the human \nrights of all and support transitional justice. We must \nalso support immediate economic recovery measures. \nOnly through such a wide-ranging programme, backed \nby an international community in which each member \nis ready to make a constructive contribution, will it be \npossible to create more favourable conditions for \nsustainable development. \n I note with regret that the spirit of optimism \nborne of the Arab Spring has not breathed new life into \nthe Middle East peace process. We remember the \nwords of President Obama before the General \nAssembly a year ago well \u2014 words that encouraged us \nto hope for change. For a few minutes, we dreamed \ntogether of  \n \u201cthe young girl in Gaza who wants to have no \nceiling on her dreams or the young boy in Sderot \nwho wants to sleep without the nightmare of \nrocket fire\u201d (A/65/PV.11, p. 12).  \nWe entertained the hope that, together with Palestine \nand Israel, we could succeed in reaching an agreement \nthat would allow us to welcome a new Member to the \nUnited Nations \u2014 a sovereign and independent \nPalestine, living side by side in peace with Israel. \n Somberly, we note instead that the past year has \nbeen a year of deadlock with no progress but \nstagnation, and even a hardening of positions. For \nmore than 60 years, the international community has \nfailed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The \nso-called peace process has replaced peace. In order to \nreturn peace to the centre of the stage, influential \npeople on both sides have attempted to implement a \ntangible and lasting vision. We gave them our support \nand facilitated a model agreement. The Geneva \ninitiative is today a consolidated, detailed proposal \ncompatible with internationally accepted parameters, \nincluding the Arab Peace Initiative. It remains at the \ndisposal of the decision-makers, as well as of the \npopulations whose right it is to demand peace. \n Preventing future wars was the goal of the \nfounding of the United Nations. Today, it remains \namong the noblest objectives of this Organization. The \npast two decades have shown that the international \ncommunity has every interest in finding ways to \nstrengthen its efforts in the area of mediation. Indeed, \nit is in a negotiated solution rather than military victory \nthat a lasting solution will be found for the majority of \nconflicts.  \n The Security Council plays an important role in \nthe prevention of conflicts. Switzerland would \nwelcome a stronger and more lasting commitment to \npreventive diplomacy on the part of the Security \nCouncil. If the Security Council is to be able to make a \nworthwhile contribution to peace and security, it must \nadapt to new realities and reflect the new political \nbalance of power of the twenty-first century. I should \nalso like it to be more transparent and open and to \nfulfil its duty of remaining accountable to the Member \nStates.  \n Ultimately, the decisions of the Security Council \nhave a direct impact on all States in ways that are \nlegally binding. That is why Switzerland advocates, \nalong with its partners in the so-called small five \ngroup, improvement of the Council\u2019s working methods. \nThe small five\u2019s proposals are practical and concrete. \nThey can be implemented immediately without any \nneed to amend the United Nations Charter.  \n \n \n51 11-50692 \n \n However, the United Nations will be truly \nstrengthened only if those countries that rightly insist \non having greater participation also show themselves \nready to accept greater responsibility for the \nOrganization\u2019s proper functioning and its financial \nsituation. \n The United Nations is unique in being the only \nOrganization that offers all the countries of the world \nthe opportunity to join together to address the whole \nrange of international challenges to peace and security, \nranging from the protection of human rights to \nsustainable development. Switzerland is ready to \ncontribute, and we look forward to working together  \n \nwith the new President of the General Assembly, \nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, whom I congratulate \non his election and offer the full support of my country \nduring this sixty-sixth session of the Assembly."

        "file_text": "Allow me begin by \ncongratulating the President of the General Assembly \nand his country, Qatar, on his election to preside over \nthe Assembly at this session, and by thanking \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership and \nachievements. \n We gather at the sixty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly at an important juncture in the \nhistory of the world. We meet at a time of exciting \npossibilities and opportunities for the betterment of \nhundreds of millions of people. Yet, these favourable \nprospects must be weighed against the profound \ndangers and sense of anxiety that currently grip our \nworld. The persistent economic and financial crisis, \nmassive unemployment, growing inequality between \nand within nations, spiralling levels of debt, recurrent \nfamines and starvation, high levels of mortality from \neasily preventable diseases and an increasingly fragile \nenvironment are wreaking havoc on the lives of people \nand the future of nations. Despite the end of the Cold \nWar and the premature declaration of the emergence of \na new world order, wars and military interventions \ncontinue \u2014 almost invariably failing to resolve, and \nfurther complicating, the problems they set out to \nsolve. \n It is true that none of these problems are new, yet \nthere is no denying that the malaise seems much more \nintractable today. Three years ago, the world was \ninfused by a renewed spirit of hope and possibility with \nthe historic election of President Barack Obama and \nthe freshness of his message of positive change. \nHowever, in spite his best efforts, the strength of his \npersonality and his many talents, that hope has not \nbeen realized. The reality is that the problems we face \nare systemic, were accumulated over many years and \ndecades, and require systemic and structural change. \nEffecting this real, positive and durable transformation \nrequires not only the effort of one leader and one \nnation and its allies, but the concerted effort of all \nnations. We look towards the emerging and \nre-emerging Powers \u2014 China, India, Russia, Brazil \nand others \u2014 to show more leadership and to shoulder \nbigger responsibilities. We also believe that all nations, \nwhatever their size, can and should play an \nincreasingly bigger and effective role in the endeavour \nto build a fair, just, equitable and sustainable world. \n This year has seen stirring and courageous \ninitiatives taken by the people of many nations to effect \nfundamental changes that would lead to a new and \ndignified beginning for them and their countries. While \nthe epicentre of the movement has been in North Africa \nand the Middle East, it is not limited to the Arab world \nor to developing nations. In much of the developed \nworld, there is now the same sense of anger and \nfrustration, the same discontent with Governments that \nhave become beholden to a small minority with special \ninterests and the same yearning for decent jobs, \nmeaningful political participation and dignified lives. \nThese realities cannot, and should not, be denied. \nClearly, this is not the time for complacency or \narrogance. What is required today is a frank \nacknowledgement of the stark global reality we face, \nand the readiness to empower our peoples and our \nyouth and to work cooperatively for a secure and \nbrighter future for all. \n As we ponder the future and take stock of the \nsweeping changes that are under way, we cannot fail to \n \n \n13 11-51191 \n \nunderscore that the United Nations has already become \nhopelessly outdated and risks becoming totally \nirrelevant. We all profess agreement on the need to \ntransform the institutions and procedures of the United \nNations, but we remain paralysed, with no prospects \nfor early progress.  \n Eritrea firmly associates itself with those who \nstress the urgency of real reform and believes that what \nis required is not a mere tweaking of the system but a \ncomprehensive transformation of the institution. The \ncritical element of this transformation has to be the \nstrengthening of the authority and role of the General \nAssembly. As long as this paramount body is deprived \nof real decision-making powers, the United Nations \nwill remain unrepresentative of the nations of the \nworld, even if the size and composition of the Security \nCouncil changes significantly. Similarly, there can be \nno meaningful revitalization without overhauling the \nmethods of work and procedures of the United Nations, \nrespecting the rights of Member States and ensuring \ntransparency and accountability in all bodies of the \nOrganization. \n Half a century has elapsed since the heyday of the \nera of decolonization that led to the emergence of \nindependent African nations. In spite the hope and \nenthusiasm of the early years and the achievements \nregistered since, the past five decades have been \nlargely disappointing. The trying times and the internal \nand external challenges that caused them are certainly \nnot over, as Africa continues to struggle in a difficult \nand complex international environment. Yet, without \nexaggerating the possibilities or underestimating the \ndifficulties, it is clear that a number of African \ncountries are entering a period of political, economic \nand social renewal. They are convinced that Africa has \nthe human and natural resources to succeed. It will not \nshun international partnerships but will give primacy to \nits own capabilities and to cooperation at the \ncontinental and subregional levels. It is this perspective \nthat is spurring African countries to focus on the key \nrequirements of developing the continent\u2019s \ninfrastructure and promoting trade and economic links \namong themselves. Another key component is the \nrevitalization of the African Union and subregional \norganizations. \n At the subregional level, Eritrea is committed to \neconomic development and integration in the wider \nHorn of Africa and Red Sea regions. We are convinced \nthat no country can succeed in a turbulent environment. \nWe will work for the revitalization of the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development and \nstrive to make it effective in promoting economic \ndevelopment and integration.  \n We welcome an independent South Sudan and \nwill work with both the Sudan and South Sudan, with \nwhom we have long-standing ties, as they grapple with \ntheir domestic situations and endeavour to build \ncooperative relations.  \n On Somalia, it has now become abundantly clear \nthat there is a need for a new approach, as the current \none has exhausted itself and can only lead to further \ncomplications. Given that the central objective remains \nthe reconstitution of Somalia and the rebuilding of \neffective institutions, it is imperative to seriously \nengage and bring into a Somali-owned political process \nall stakeholders, including the Governments of \nSomaliland and Puntland. \n With regard to the Middle East, which is a key \nitem on the agenda of the current session of the \nGeneral Assembly, Eritrea reaffirms its long-standing \nsupport for the right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and an independent, sovereign State. It \nalso upholds the right of Israel to live in peace and \nsecurity within internationally recognized boundaries. \nAt the same time, Eritrea is genuinely concerned that \nthe current drive for United Nations membership for \nPalestine does not become a symbolic battle bereft of \nreal substance. It is only prudent and relevant to recall \nthat with the exception of a few realistic voices, the \nOslo Accords were greeted with much acclaim and \nthat, almost two decades later, they have not led to \neither Palestinian Statehood or peace between the \nPalestinian and Israeli peoples. \n Finally, I would be remiss in my duty if I did not \nremind the United Nations of its responsibility to \nuphold its Charter, international law and numerous \nSecurity Council resolutions and take urgent action to \nend Ethiopia\u2019s occupation of sovereign Eritrean \nterritory. Coupled with the lifting of the illegal \nsanctions on Eritrea, that would not only serve the \ncause of justice, but it would enable the people of the \nregion to work together to further their collective \ninterests and consolidate Africa\u2019s place in the world."

        "file_text": "In taking \nthe floor for the first time before this Assembly, I offer \nmy heartfelt thanks to the international community and \nall the friendly countries that had faith in our struggle \nfor democracy, and whose support never failed us \nduring the painful and trying post-electoral crisis in \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. \n Please also allow me, Mr. President, to \ncongratulate you warmly, as other speakers before me \nhave done, on your outstanding election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession, which attests to the recognition of your \nremarkable contribution to expanding the influence of \nthe Organization and promoting its ideals. We assure \nyou of my delegation\u2019s full support in carrying out \nyour mandate. I would also like to convey to your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, my full \nappreciation and that of my delegation for his \nremarkable work and encouraging results during his \npresidency. \n I would further like to make a special mention \nhere of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ndetermined commitment and tireless efforts on behalf \nof world peace, earning him deserved reappointment to \na second term at the head of the United Nations. In \nreiterating my warm congratulations upon your \nre-election, I would also like to reaffirm, on behalf of \nthe Ivorian people and Government, as well as \npersonally, our profound gratitude and thanks for the \ncrucial role the United Nations and you personally \nplayed in resolving the Ivorian crisis. \n I note with satisfaction that, for the first time in \nhistory, a woman \u2014 Ms. Dilma Rousseff, \ndemocratically elected in 2010 to lead Brazil \u2014 \nopened our general debate. I celebrate this fact. \n The theme chosen for this session \u2014 \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d \u2014 demonstrates our will to place our \nOrganization at the heart of international crisis \nresolution. It also focuses the attention of our \nAssembly on one of the main missions entrusted to the \nUnited Nations \u2014 the use and promotion of \nnegotiations in the resolutions of conflicts, whose \nproliferation and gravity have posed an unrelenting \nthreat to the balance and progress of humankind in \nrecent years. The implementation of such an approach \nin international relations calls for resolute involvement \nand solidarity on the part of Member States in seeking \nnegotiated solutions to current and potential disputes at \nthe international, regional and subregional levels. In \nthis regard, I welcome the independence of South \nSudan and its admission as the 193rd State Member of \nthe United Nations. \n The recent history of peoples underscores the \nvirtues of dialogue and negotiation for resolving even \nthe most complex conflicts, as proven by the \ndismantling of apartheid and the progress, albeit \nmodest, in the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian \ncrisis. \n This is a theme close to our hearts, as the father \nof the Ivorian nation, President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-\nBoigny, left his mark on the history of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \nand the entire African continent as a result of his \npragmatic approach to resolving conflicts through \ndialogue. The UNESCO F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny \nPeace Prize attests to and represents the international \ncommunity\u2019s recognition of his efforts to promote \npeace. I am therefore honoured and proud to make a \n  \n \n11-50865 10 \n \ncommitment to follow in the footsteps of the approach \npromoted by that apostle disciple of dialogue and \npeace. In this context, my country is fully ready, as in \nthe past, to tirelessly promote the option of negotiation \nto resolve and prevent conflicts and safeguard peace \u2014 \na prerequisite for all social and economic development \nin the world. \n The much sought prize of peace, even through the \nappropriate routes of consultation and dialogue, cannot \nbe achieved without more balanced and fairer \neconomic development in our world. In this regard, the \neconomic and financial crisis that has shaken the world \nfor three years and whose consequences are still being \nfelt, especially in developing countries, demands \naction, even as growth becomes more apparent in some \nregions. This trend has been growing since 2010, due \nin part to the economic performance of emerging and \ndeveloping countries, must absolutely be consolidated \nif we want to sustainably prevent the relapse of such a \ncrisis.  \n Nevertheless, strong economic growth is not \nenough to guarantee security and stability in our world. \nIt must necessarily be accompanied by transparent and \nequitable access to employment, especially for young \npeople, security and justice if we truly want to break \nthe cycles of political and criminal violence. We must \ntherefore urgently adopt a new model for development \nbased on environmental constraints that ensures that \nthe needs of the population for employment, security \nand justice are met. Such a challenge can be overcome \nonly through solidarity. \n The food, energy and environmental crises and \nnatural disasters, which have become ever more \nfrequent and serious due to the effects of climate \nchange, demonstrate that the balance of human life, \ndespite the immense progress achieved in a great \nnumber of areas, remains fragile. They also underscore \nhow closely the fates of the peoples of the world are \nlinked, as no geographic, racial or religious division \ncan withstand either the occurrence or the negative \neffects of these phenomena. Aware of our \nresponsibilities to our people and, above all, to \nhumankind as a whole, we must therefore join forces \nthrough the multilateral framework to seek innovative \nand effective solutions to these crises and other \ncatastrophes, which pose a real threat to international \npeace and security. \n In this regard, I would like to reiterate the \ncompassion of the people and Government of C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire to the victims of natural disasters, especially \nin Japan, the Caribbean and the United States. I extend \nspecial and brotherly sympathy to the peoples of the \nHorn of Africa, who are suffering the grave effects of \nfamine as a result of an extended drought. \n Faced with these humanitarian tragedies, the \npolitical commitment of all States Members of the \nUnited Nations is indispensable. My delegation \ntherefore welcomes the initiatives undertaken by the \ninternational community \u2014 especially the French \npresidency of the Group of 20, and the specialized \ninstitutions of the United Nations and the African \nUnion \u2014 to meet the immediate needs of the affected \npopulations. \n International peace and security remain a cause of \nmajor concern for our Organization, given the \nproliferation of armed conflicts, nuclear threats, \nterrorist activity, transnational crime, human \ntrafficking, drug trafficking and pandemics. All of \nthese hamper the world\u2019s harmonious development, \nespecially in Africa, which, riven by many areas of \ntension, struggles to ensure its economic and social \ndevelopment despite its enormous potential. \n The United Nations has a role to play in \nstrengthening the international solidarity that is \nindispensable as we seek effective and appropriate \nsolutions to these crises. This requires the mobilization \nof adequate resources to fund research and \ndevelopment in the areas of food crop production, \nrenewable energy and sustainable development. To that \nend, a substantial reduction in military spending is \nrequired, allowing such resources to be found. Such a \nsacrifice would be very useful towards the survival of \nmankind. \n Aware of these crises, since taking office I have \nsought to enhance the security of my country. \nDiscussions are nearing completion on tripartite \nagreements with our neighbours, particularly \nLiberia \u2014 with which one has already been signed \u2014 \nGhana and Guinea, with the support of the High \nCommissioner for Refugees and United Nations \npeacekeepers present in the region. These agreements \nseek to ensure the voluntary and rapid return of Ivorian \nrefugees from those brotherly countries and to protect \nour eastern and western borders from the movement of \n \n \n11 11-50865 \n \narmed groups, drug trafficking and traffic in precious \nmetals. \n Negotiations are also under way with our Western \npartners to ensure that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire becomes a \nbulwark of regional defence and security in the fight \nagainst terrorism. The recent ratification of the \nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of \nthe Child on the involvement of children in armed \nconflict reinforces our firm resolve to use all legal \nmeans to combat violence and to protect the security of \nour most vulnerable people, particularly women and \nchildren. \n The outcome of the social and political conflict \nthat began in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in 2002 marks the return of \ndemocracy to our country, based on the promise of the \nrule of law and a society that shares the common ideals \nof peace and respect for human rights. For that reason, \ncoexistence is the cornerstone of my Government\u2019s \nprogramme. As soon as I took office, I established \nnational reconciliation as one of our priorities by \ncreating a Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission designed to create conditions conducive \nto dialogue among all levels of society in order to heal \nthe wounds of the crisis, re-knit the social fabric, \nrestore national cohesion and promote peace and \njustice. \n Furthermore, the Government, which is \nresponsible for making those principles the basis for its \nactivities, is working tirelessly to ensure social and \neconomic recovery towards the reconstruction C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire. Thus, the President\u2019s emergency programme \nlaunched in March, while I was at the Golf Hotel, has \nalready had favourable results for the people of C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire, particularly those of Abidjan, who suffered \npillage and property destruction. The programme is \nfocused in particular on improving basic social \nservices, especially the provision of drinking water, \nhealth care, education, electricity and public sanitation, \nwhich are major challenges that must be met as we \nattempt to achieve our Millennium Development \nGoals. \n The organization of parliamentary elections \nbefore the end of this year will allow us to enhance \ndemocracy and social justice in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with the \nsupport and assistance of the United Nations through \nSecurity Council resolution 2000 (2011) of 27 July \n2011, which demonstrates again the Organization\u2019s \ndetermination to support C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire until the end of \nthe crisis as provided by the Ouagadougou Political \nAgreement. \n The socio-political crisis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire over \nthe past 10 years has undermined the economic and \nsocial development of my country. It is my ambition, \nas we approach 2020, to make C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire an \nemerging nation, reconciled with itself and with other \nnations and united by republican values; a modern \nState that respects the independence of the judiciary \nand will combat impunity and ensure the promotion of \nmerit and competence. \n In closing on this note of hope for my country, I \ncall for the determined and ongoing involvement of all \nStates Members of the United Nations in the pursuit, \nthrough dialogue and cooperation, of collective, \neffective and lasting solutions that will create a better \nworld based on more harmonious and secure forms of \ndevelopment. \n C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which in the past was often called \non to help in the quest for peaceful solutions to \nconflicts, intends to take up this vocation once again. \nThis is a natural mission for us in many respects, \nbecause C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, as F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny \nsaid, is the friend of all and the enemy of none."

I also take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \nreappointment, confident that he will continue to work \ndevotedly to realize the noble objectives of the United \nNations. \n The Republic of Macedonia recently celebrated \nthe twentieth anniversary of its independence. We have \nfaced many challenges and temptations, including \nachieving a peaceful declaration of independence, the \nintroduction of a new political system with due respect \nfor democratic values and human rights and freedoms, \ntransforming our economic system and then dealing \nwith many social problems, establishing ourselves as a \nresponsible and active member of the international \ncommunity, and shouldering the additional burden of \nvarious requirements and conditions. \n Throughout this time, the Republic of Macedonia \nhas had the United Nations as a partner. Based on \nlessons learned over the past 20 years, my country is \nparticularly conscious of the value of mediation in the \npeaceful settlement of conflicts. Macedonia welcomes \nthe timely and wise decision to make the role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans the focus of this year\u2019s debate.  \n The majority of conflicts do not happen \novernight; they are predictable and offer realistic \nopportunities for effective diplomatic efforts to prevent \nthem. Such cases offer the chance of incurring the \nlowest cost in every way. While we affirm the \nsovereignty of States, we must take into consideration \nthat there are moments when a State or States need \nmediation services, with impartiality and willingness \non the part of the mediators to understand the thrust of \nthe issues and to help all parties concerned resolve \ntheir problems in a mutually acceptable and \nsatisfactory manner before they can escalate in an \nunwanted direction. \n The Millennium Development Goals remain the \nparameters we need to evaluate our success. Regardless \nof the serious consequences of the global economic \ncrisis, our commitment to achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals must not weaken. The greatest \ncrises occur as a result of a lack of vision and \ndedication. Turning a blind eye to problems or finding \nexcuses to justify a lack of action to achieve our goals \nwill only increase the price to be paid in future; and \nthat will not be calculated merely in dollars or euros, \nbut also in the most valuable and priceless asset: \nhuman lives. \n One challenge that requires an immediate and \nlong-term solution is the issue of climate change. It is \nalarming that, precisely as a result of climate change \ncaused by human activity, entire nations and States \nface uncertainty on a daily basis. Although the \nRepublic of Macedonia has experienced the adverse \neffects of climate change in a less dramatic way, it \nwishes to express its solidarity with the countries that \nare most exposed to the phenomenon. \n In recent times, we have witnessed numerous \nconflicts and the disturbance of peace and security in \nvarious regions of the world. The democratic \nawakening, especially the so-called Arab Spring, has \nshown us once more that democracy cannot be \nimposed; it can be derived only from the people\u2019s \nrejection of dictatorships and regimes that are in \nconflict with the popular interest, and from respect for \nbasic human rights, universal freedoms and the rule of \nlaw.  \n Old and frozen conflicts remain a global \nchallenge. The problem of the abuse of programmes \nintended for the peaceful use of nuclear energy has not \nyet been solved. Terrorism and extreme hunger caused \nby conflicts are only two of the numerous challenges to \nwhich it is imperative that we find immediate solutions \n  \n \n11-51360 34 \n \naimed at improving security at the global and regional \nlevels. \n Human beings must be the focus of our attention, \nespecially in national policy and, of course, in \nmultilateral actions. There is no greater value than \nhuman life, human dignity and the right to individual \ndevelopment, prosperity and happiness. Humankind \nrequires action that transforms our declarations and \ngood intentions into deeds. When we ask for that moral \nimperative from the United Nations, we are practicing \nwhat we preach. The Republic of Macedonia will \ncontinue to be an active participant in the realization of \nour common objectives. \n There are many words I could use to describe my \ncountry, and each and every one would fit perfectly in \nits own manner. But to begin with, I choose only one, \nand I am convinced that it describes the essence of my \ncountry and my people and accurately illustrates all the \nefforts and strength we have summoned in order to \novercome the challenges of our recent history. It \nclearly describes the patience with which we have \nfaced every obstacle imposed on us, and which we \nhave overcome and continue to overcome, at the \neconomic and institutional level, simply by asserting \nour own identity and self-recognition. These obstacles \nhave been imposed not because of anything we have \ndone, but simply because of who we are and the fact \nthat we exist. That word is \u201cresponsibility\u201d. \n Macedonia has acted responsibly. Our country\u2019s \nindependence was won through a history that cannot be \ncalled merciful. It rests on the great sacrifice of many \nlives and broken dreams. Yet our past is not the only \nreason why we act responsibly. We Macedonians \nbelieve that we have a European future and that we can \nleave a great legacy for generations to come. That is \nprecisely why today we in Macedonia are trying to \ncreate a broad base of support and to unify all of our \nstrength and potential around the bold idea of \nMacedonia as a regional leader in economic reform, \neducation, investment, technology and innovation; in \nprotection of the environment and of human rights and \nfreedoms; and in all areas of modern life. Knowing the \ngreat awareness and responsibility of my people \u2014 and \nciting the example of country\u2019s response to the global \neconomic crisis, when our solidarity was not shaken \nand we came through it all without major problems \u2014 \nI am convinced that our unity will succeed. \n When speaking of Macedonia, however, we \ncannot fail to mention another great characteristic that \nhas remained with us over thousands of years. As our \ninheritance from ancient times, this characteristic has \nhelped us to retain our cosmopolitanism \u2014 the ideal \nthat has enabled us to maintain a functional \nmulticulturalism. Side by side, throughout the \ncenturies, different cultures, religions and nations have \ncoexisted in my country. While many Europeans deem \nthat astonishing and unique, for us Macedonians that \nhas been the situation for centuries. We aim for \nincorporation into the dominant culture, without any \nassimilation or disintegration. Unlike many others \nwho, afraid for their own national myth, try to suppress \ndifferences, we are proud of them and consider them \nour treasure. \n Our system is not perfect, and we have many \nissues to resolve. Macedonia is on the verge of a great \ntransformation, which will not happen overnight. We, \nlike every other nation in the world, have the right to \nan identity and to unite around our own national myth. \nIn our myth, there is a place for Macedonians, \nAlbanians, Turks, Roma, Serbs, Vlachs, Bosniaks and \nothers. There is a place for all who accept the virtues of \nnon-violence, justice, coexistence and cultural \ncompetitiveness. Chauvinism has never been dominant \namong our people. The constitutional amendments of \n1993 and the change in our flag showed our goodwill, \nopenness and cooperativeness. However, our sense of \nresponsibility and our maturity should not be \nconsidered as weaknesses, nor should they be a reason \nfor continuous abuse from anyone, because we have \ndignity and pride. We know who we are and how we \nwill live. We are Macedonians, we speak Macedonian, \nand our country\u2019s name is the Republic of Macedonia. \n As Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia, \nI would be remiss if I were to neglect the issue of our \nname and identity and our southern neighbour\u2019s \nobjection to both. I mention this not only because of \nmy position and obligation to the people of the \nRepublic of Macedonia, but also because it relates in \nmany ways directly to the issue of the peaceful \nresolution of conflict and the role that mediation plays.  \n We do not like being in the position of having our \nname and identity opposed by one country, and we \ncertainly did not ask for it. But reality is often cold, \nhard and brutal. The fact is that our southern neighbour \nobjects to both our name and identity; its objection has \nbecome our problem, and a dispute has arisen that is \n \n \n35 11-51360 \n \nunique in the world. It is imposed on the basis of the \nneed of one country, our neighbour, to monopolize two \nnames, and its strategic determination that we should \nnot exist as we feel ourselves to be.  \n Imagine the state that my citizens find themselves \nin \u2014 blackmailed, with their development and \nprospects jeopardized, blocked by our southern \nneighbour from joining euro-Atlantic institutions, just \nbecause of what we are and what we feel like. I \npersonally, and literally all of the citizens of my \ncountry, cannot believe that we have been put in a \nsituation where we have to resolve a dispute that was \nartificially created and absurd. I believe that it is also \nutterly incomprehensible to all present. I would ask \nparticipants in this meeting to imagine, just for a \nmoment, that they are in our shoes, to consider how \nthey would feel if someone demanded they not be \nFrench, German, British, American, Russian, Chinese, \nNigerian, Japanese, Argentine, Uruguayan or Kenyan, \nfor instance. That is the only thing I ask, the only thing \nI plead for. I ask for support to end this, to allow us to \nbe what we are. We hurt no one and inflict damage on \nno one. We have understanding, tolerance and respect \nfor our neighbours and friends and for everyone. We \nhave respect for the neighbour with which we are \nhaving this dispute and an understanding of its fears. \nWe have no pretensions, nor do we have any intention \nof monopolizing the name Macedonia. \n Please help us to be proud and dignified and to \navoid a solution that would break us. We seek a \nsolution that will not harm our spirit and a name that \nwill recognize our commitment, desire and \ndetermination for coexistence, community, \nindividuality and identity as well as our sense of \nbelonging to the world \u2014 this world that we are \nbuilding, whose virtues we are establishing and whose \nfuture we are fighting for. Macedonians are a peaceful \npeople and are working, with mediation, to resolve the \ndispute with our neighbour in a peaceful manner. \n In a speech to the Parliament of the Republic of \nMacedonia on 31 August 2001, our late President, \nBoris Trajkovski, said: \n  \u201cWe demand that the international \ncommunity recognize us by our name \u2014 the \nRepublic of Macedonia \u2014 and not by a fictional \nderivative. It is high time that the world \nrecognizes us by what we call ourselves, just like \nany other country and its citizens. Otherwise, \nhow do you expect us to believe in your values, \nprinciples and intentions if you deny our basic \nright, the right to identity?\u201d \n Fortunately, 131 countries around the world have \nmade a choice to recognize us by what we call \nourselves \u2014 the Republic of Macedonia \u2014 and for that \nwe thank them. We thank them for their principled \nposition and consistency in the values of protection of \nthe rights and principles established by the United \nNations itself. Unfortunately, the rules of the world are \nsuch that we cannot be called by what we call \nourselves in this very body. Nor can we join \norganizations we have worked hard to become \nmembers of, and, in the case of NATO and the \nEuropean Union, have earned a right to be a part of. \nThis, frankly, is wrong. There is no other word for it. \nWhat others choose to do about it \u2014 their behaviour \u2014 \nis entirely up to them. \n It is a great honour and great privilege to address \nthis body. All of us are leaders of our people and all of \nus represent them to the best of our abilities. But we \nmust recommit ourselves as leaders to our own peoples \nfirst, and to the peoples of this world second. If we do \nthat, we can survive, we can succeed and we can build \na better world for ourselves, our children, our \ngrandchildren and for future generations, which, \nultimately is what each and every one of us wants."

        "file_text": "For \nHonduras, it is a source of great satisfaction to \nparticipate in this important session of the General \nAssembly. On behalf of the Honduran people, I should \nlike at the outset to express our great pleasure at the \nre-appointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon for another term \nas Secretary-General. I also wish to convey to the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession, Mr. Joseph Deiss, my greatest respect for the \ncontribution he made to this global forum through the \nfruitful work achieved under his leadership. We also \ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser upon his \nelection as President of the General Assembly. \n I congratulate the State of South Sudan on having \nbecome the newest Member of the United Nations. \n It is also timely to reaffirm my decisive \ncommitment as a leader to this Organization, which \nrepresents the best forum for addressing and resolving \nthe problems facing the world in the quest for the \ncommon welfare of humankind based on the principles \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I \nreaffirm our commitment to the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights, and in particular to the principle that \nwe are all free and equal in dignity and rights. This \nconcept includes peoples and nations alike. Over and \nabove geopolitical interests, the self-determination of \npeoples is inviolable and inalienable. All peoples have \nthe right to their own territory, cultural identity and \ntraditions. \n In this context, my Government has recognized \nPalestine as a State and endorses its legitimate \naspiration to become a full member in the concert of \nnations. Full security for the State of Israel and full \ninternational recognition for Palestine are essential \nconditions for a comprehensive negotiated two-State \nsolution providing for strong and lasting peace through \nmutual understanding. If we want peace, we must \nrecall that peace is based on respect not only for human \nrights, but also for the rights of peoples and nations. \n With regard to my country, Honduras, I must say \nthat the political crises it suffered and the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat \nof 28 June 2009 led to a deterioration in the human \nrights situation. Overcoming it is one of our highest \npriorities. Since I took office in January 2010, my task \nhas been to build unity and reconciliation among the \nHonduran people through peacebuilding founded on \nsocial justice. That process of reconciliation and \n  \n \n11-50702 2 \n \ndemocracy-building in our country has enjoyed the \nconstructive support of the international community as \na whole.  \n I take this opportunity to express my particular \nthanks for the mediation efforts of Presidents Juan \nManuel Santos Calder\u00f3n of Colombia and Hugo \nCh\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, \nwhich led to the signing of the Cartagena Agreement, \nwhich in turn facilitated the return of Honduras to the \nOrganization of American States.  \n We have demonstrated by our actions that there is \nno State policy to violate human rights in Honduras; on \nthe contrary, we work every day to promote a culture \nof respect for human rights based on ongoing dialogue \nwith all sectors of society, with special attention to \nthose sectors that have generally been deprived of the \nright to participate. We are building a participatory \ndemocracy, derived from the principle that all social \ngroups have the full and legitimate right to take part in \nour history.  \n We have a secretariat for justice and human rights \nto advise on relevant policies. With the participation of \ncivil society organizations, the secretariat is \nenthusiastically working on developing our country\u2019s \nfirst public human rights policy and a national action \nplan on human rights. It is also following the \nrecommendations made by the Human Rights Council \nto Honduras during the Universal Periodic Review. In \nline with those aspirations, in July our Truth and \nReconciliation Commission \u2014 having worked in \nabsolute legitimacy and transparency \u2014 completed its \nfully independent mandate and presented the people of \nHonduras with its report and recommendations so as to \nensure that such things never happen again and to \nfoment reconciliation within the Honduran family. We \nare taking the necessary steps to implement those \nrecommendations.  \n At the same time, faced with the global crisis that \nresulted from serious problems in developed \neconomies, we have met with trade unions, \nentrepreneurs, workers, farmers, civil society and \npolitical parties to reach an overall national agreement \nthat will enable us to face the challenges that the crisis \ncreated in our country. Our Honduran response has \nbeen to propose a social pact to establish conditions \npropitious for economic growth, employment, \nappropriate remuneration and productivity. The \nnational plan for the next 28 years is under way. We are \nempowering our citizens. The optimum Government \nwe can shape is comprised of a people who themselves \nwant to develop within a framework of equitable \neconomic growth. \n Alongside that overall national agreement, all \nsectors and stakeholders in the field of education are \nreaching agreement on wide-reaching educational \nreform in Honduras to propel a dynamic education \nadministration guaranteeing equal opportunity for all, \nespecially those who have the least. \n In the social sphere, we have a family assistance \nprogramme with conditional monetary benefits. More \nthan 400,000 families have received such payments, \nand by 2013 we hope to reach 600,000 families, \nrepresenting 50 per cent of families in Honduras. The \ncondition is that children go to school and that parents \nattend child-nutrition programmes.  \n In September 2010, along with President Johnson \nToribiong of Palau, we called upon heads of State of \nUnited Nations Member States to save sharks, stop the \ntraffic in shark fins and put an end to global \noverfishing of the species. I repeat that plea with the \nsame passion today.  \n Although our country does not contribute much \nto greenhouse gas emissions, we have signed many \ninternational treaties and conventions that aim to \nguarantee the planet\u2019s security and climate for its \ninhabitants in the context of the clean development \nmechanism under the Kyoto Protocol. Beyond those \nimportant conventions, today we will sign the \nRotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent \nProcedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and \nPesticides in International Trade.  \n Honduras reiterates its strong approval of all \nmeasures to protect and conserve natural resources and \nthe environment, based on the principles agreed upon \n20 years ago. We ask the States Member of the United \nNations to renew those past commitments and to draw \nup national policies so that we can build our capacities \nand establish mechanisms that respond to the needs of \nthe population. \n Although it is not enough in itself, my \nGovernment has made significant progress in \npromoting the just historical claims, rights and profile \nof indigenous peoples and people of African descent. \nIn accordance with the Durban Declaration and Plan of \nAction, we have adopted public policies to work \n \n \n3 11-50702 \n \ntowards those commitments. Among them I would \nmention our ratification of the International \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination, the institution of an African Heritage \nMonth in Honduras, and the creation and inauguration \nof a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples and People of \nAfrican Descent.  \n I note that the United Nations, through General \nAssembly resolution 64/169, proclaimed 2011 the \nInternational Year for People of African Descent. In \nthat context, civil society members of African descent, \nin cooperation with the Organization for Ethnic \nCommunity Development convened and celebrated the \nFirst World Summit of People of African Descent in \nAugust, amply supported by my Government, other \nGovernments, international partners and United \nNations system bodies. One of my Government\u2019s \naspirations is to complete our constitutional reform to \ndefine Honduras as a multi-ethnic, multicultural \ncountry.  \n My Government joins its voice to those of \nmillions of people of African descent in calling for the \nUnited Nations to institute a decade for people of \nAfrican descent beginning in 2012, create a \ndevelopment fund for people of African descent, and \nestablish a permanent forum for peoples of African \ndescent within the United Nations. \n Before concluding, I would like to raise an issue \nthat is one of the greatest and most important \nchallenges that our region faces: citizen insecurity. The \nmost recent analysis carried out by the United Nations \nOffice on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and the World Bank show \nthat Central America has become the region in the \nworld with the highest levels of violence and organized \ncrime. Their economic impact has escalated in the past \ndecade to reach, in the case of Honduras, a level close \nto 10 per cent of our gross domestic product.  \n Violence and transnational organized crime, \nprimarily evident in the commission of crimes such as \ndrug trafficking, kidnapping, murder, money and asset \nlaundering, people trafficking, arms trafficking, the \ncommercial sexual exploitation of women and minors, \namong other crimes, are a serious threat to our \npossibilities to create well-being. Without security, \nthere is no economic growth or development. \n The evidence shows that many of those crimes, \nfrom the organized crime and lack of security to which \nthey give rise and that prevail in our societies, have \ntheir roots in the use and trafficking of drugs. Owing to \ntheir very nature and to the sums of money involved, \nthey have a serious impact on our societies and add to \nthe erosion of our system of values. They steal our \nyoung people, destroy conviviality and community life \nand create parallel economic systems that are true \nenclaves of crime, violence and degradation.  \n Today, the countries of the region invest huge \namounts of money in combating the production and \ntrafficking of drugs. However, practically the only \ninstances in which the production and trafficking of \ndrugs significantly drop in a region occur as a result of \na change in routes or production being in other areas. \nGiven that demand in developing countries has not \ndecreased, the strategy that we follow in the region \ntoday, in the best case scenario, has only a partial and \nlimited impact on the trafficking, transport and use of \ndrugs.  \n For that reason, we note that, first of all, a pilot \nproject that we have put to the United Nations should \nbe launched to strengthen the capacity for the \ninvestigation and trial of organized crime in Honduras. \nSecondly, we need to gather together all the strategies \nthat were discussed at the International Conference in \nSupport of the Central America Security Strategy on \n22 and 23 June in Guatemala. We should also point out, \nand it must be reaffirmed, that consumer countries \nmust act bravely and resolutely in order to reduce or \neliminate the use of and the trade in drugs because we \nmust realize that without that, it will be very difficult \nfor our societies to end the scourge. We must succeed \nin aligning our strategies so as to end the drug scourge \nand organized crime.  \n I would like to end by expressing my best wishes \nfor this sixty-sixth session to meet the expectations of \nall Member States, which, I am sure, are founded on \nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States."

        "file_text": "I would like \nto begin by extending my sincere congratulations to \nAmbassador Al-Nasser on his assumption of the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I have every confidence that under his able \nleadership this session will be guided to a fruitful \nconclusion. \n May I also take this opportunity to extend my \nwarmest congratulations to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon on his re-election as Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations, with unanimous support from Member \nStates, and to thank him for the great commitment and \ndevotion he has shown over the past five years to \nachieving the vision of a responsible United Nations. I \nhave no doubt that in his second term he will make an \neven greater contribution to creating a stronger United \nNations for a better world. \n This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s membership in the United \nNations. It would be no exaggeration to say that the \nRepublic of Korea came into the world with the United \nNations and grew up along with the Organization. It \nwas under United Nations auspices that the democratic \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea was established \nin 1948. Through a General Assembly resolution (195 \n(III)), the Government of the Republic of Korea gained \ninternational recognition as the only lawful \nGovernment on the Korean peninsula. When the \nKorean War broke out two years later, United Nations \nforces played a decisive role in defending the country. \nIn the aftermath of the war and during the years of \nnational reconstruction, the United Nations provided us \nwith generous economic assistance and the concept of \n  \n \n11-50692 32 \n \nuniversal human rights, thus promoting progress on \nboth the economic and democratic fronts. \n In spite of such special historic ties between the \nUnited Nations and the Republic of Korea, it was only \nwith the end of the Cold War, in 1991, more than \n40 years later, that the Republic of Korea was admitted \nto the United Nations. For the past 20 years, the \nRepublic of Korea has made every effort to realize the \ncauses and values of the United Nations. We have \nplayed an active role in various areas of international \ncooperation, including the global fight against poverty, \nsustainable development, the promotion of human \nrights and democracy, and the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. \n The Republic of Korea began its journey as one \nof the poorest countries in the world, engulfed in war \nand poverty, and has managed to achieve remarkable \nsuccess on both the economic and democratic fronts. It \nmay therefore be rightly said that the Republic of \nKorea is an exemplary international success story, fully \nembracing and reflecting the values espoused by the \nUnited Nations, be they those relating to democracy, \nhuman rights or development. \n Now the Republic of Korea wishes to give back \nto the international community even more than it has \nreceived. We stand ready to extend a helping hand to \nthose in need, providing them with appropriate support \nand care. We are keen to cooperate closely with the \nUnited Nations and to play a constructive role in \ncombating the various challenges facing the \ninternational community. \n Maintaining international peace and security is \nthe fundamental responsibility of the United Nations. \nFor the past 60 years, the United Nations has made \nevery effort to prevent war and armed conflict in the \ninternational arena. Furthermore, it has provided varied \nand creative means for maintaining sustainable peace \nin dangerous parts of the world, from preventive \ndiplomacy and peacekeeping to post-conflict \npeacebuilding. The most striking example may be in \nthe advancement of United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. There has been an increase in demand for \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations since the end \nof the Cold War. As a result, not only has there been an \nincrease in the number of personnel, but the work of \nthe operations has also become more diverse and \nmultifaceted, extending beyond the monitoring of \nceasefires to assisting in nation-building. \n Peacekeeping operations offer great hope for \nmillions of those who suffer in the midst of war and \nnatural disasters. The Republic of Korea is proud to \nparticipate in 10 United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions, including those in Haiti and Lebanon. \n Today, while still struggling with conventional \nsecurity threats, the international community faces new \ntypes of security threats, such as the spread of weapons \nof mass destruction (WMDs) and the threat of \nterrorism. The international community must \nstrengthen its non-proliferation regime in order to \nprevent the proliferation of nuclear, biological and \nchemical weapons and long-range missiles. \n Furthermore, the threat of transnational terrorism \nhas emerged as a serious security issue that requires \nconcerted effort from the international community, in \nparticular since the attacks of 9/11. The Republic of \nKorea stands firmly against, and condemns all forms \nand manifestations of, terrorism. Terrorism, a vicious \nmeans to achieve political objectives by taking \ninnocent civilian lives, cannot be justified under any \ncircumstances. The international community must \nreaffirm its determination to eradicate terrorism and \nstep up its collective counter-terrorism efforts. \n The greatest threat of all, perhaps, emanates from \nnuclear terrorism. International cooperation is now \nneeded more than ever to prevent it. Following the first \nNuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., last \nyear, the second such summit will be held in Seoul in \nMarch 2012. The Republic of Korea is making every \neffort to ensure that the Summit will constitute a \nvaluable opportunity for the international community \nto build a more solid system of international \ncooperation, which is necessary to prevent nuclear \nterrorism. \n This year, the international community has \nwitnessed a wave of dramatic changes sweeping across \nNorth Africa and the Middle East. The democratic \nmovement that began in Tunisia, which then swiftly \nspread to Egypt and Libya, has proved that democracy \nis a universal value of humankind that transcends \nregion and culture. At this very moment, the people of \nSyria and Yemen are taking great risks to hold aloft the \ntorch of freedom and democracy. \n Democracy is a vehicle that unites the basic \nvalues of humankind, such as freedom and equality, \nhuman rights and the rule of law. The people\u2019s demand \nfor democracy is their legitimate right. The \n \n \n33 11-50692 \n \ninternational community and the United Nations must \ndo all they can to protect these people from persecution \nand human rights abuses. \n United Nations efforts have played a great role in \nthe recent democratic progress in Africa. The United \nNations facilitated the birth of the Republic of South \nSudan through peaceful referendum, and played a \ncrucial role in the progress of democracy in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire by realizing the transfer of power. \n Nevertheless, as history has only too clearly \nshown, building democracy is no easy task. It is \nimportant that fledgling economies in many parts of \nthe world become sustainable and robust. Above all, it \nis essential that these nations form stable Governments \nthrough elections and achieve economic development. \nThe United Nations must be there for them. \n Democracy constitutes a foundation for \nsustainable national development. For the Republic of \nKorea, economic growth and democratization have \nbeen achieved in a mutually reinforcing manner.  \n In the twenty-first century, in this age of \nglobalization and communication revolution, the tide \nof democratization is unstoppable regardless of a \nnation\u2019s economic standing.  \n I believe that a vibrant economy will push \nforward economic growth in all corners of the world. \nTo assist developing nations pursue both democracy \nand economic growth is indeed the role of the United \nNations. \n The market economy and democracy have \nenabled humankind to fulfil the desire for a better life, \nalong with the values of freedom and individual \nhappiness. However, the growing gap between rich and \npoor, which unfortunately accompanies today\u2019s highly \ndeveloped market economy, calls for self-reflection \nvis-\u00e0-vis the capitalist system and greater public \nresponsibility. \n The growing gap between developed and \ndeveloping countries should not only be addressed as a \npoverty issue, but should also be understood as a \npotential destabilizing element to international peace. \nFurthermore, this inequality stands against the global \nvision of achieving common prosperity for all \nhumankind. \n It is only when members of the international \ncommunity share each other\u2019s burden and work \ntogether in a mutually complementary manner towards \na common goal that the eco-systemic development of \nthe world can be achieved. Developed nations must \nhelp developing countries to maximize their capacity \nso that they can achieve economic growth and \ndevelopment on their own. To that end, it is important \nto foster a global atmosphere that is conducive to \nsupporting the development of trade, investment, \nfinance and human resources in developing countries. \n International aid must focus on, and provide \nsupport to, areas that form the basis of economic \ndevelopment in developing countries, such as \ninfrastructure and trade-related capacity building. At \nthe same time, efforts must be made to strengthen the \nrole of multilateral organizations, including the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in \ndevelopment assistance. Such efforts should be \ngrounded in the sincere belief that the growth of \ndeveloping countries will provide a valuable growth \nengine for all, including developed countries, by \nexpanding global demand as a whole. \n Through the global financial crisis in 2008, we \nhave come to realize once again that we live in a highly \ninterconnected world. A financial crisis that started in \none place became global in an instant. No country was \nspared from the bitter sting of economic crisis. In the \nface of the crisis, the Group of Twenty (G-20), a \nmechanism that brings together both developed and \ndeveloping nations, was created.  \n The Seoul Development Consensus for Shared \nGrowth, which was adopted last year at the G-20 Seoul \nSummit, and the G-20 multi-year action plan outline \nspecific measures to realize growth that embraces \ndeveloping countries as partners. As a member of the \nG-20, the Republic of Korea will faithfully and \nactively implement those measures. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nchampioned by the United Nations, constitute another \nimportant agenda that pursues shared growth between \ndeveloped and developing nations. The Government of \nthe Republic of Korea will be an active participant in \ninternational development cooperation as pursued by \nthe MDGs. We will faithfully implement our plan to \ndouble our current level of official development \nassistance by 2015 and, drawing wisdom from our past \nexperience, will assist developing countries in ways to \nbuild capacity to achieve genuine growth on their own. \n  \n \n11-50692 34 \n \n I hope that the fourth High-Level Forum on Aid \nEffectiveness to be held in Busan in November this \nyear will provide a valuable opportunity to set a new \nglobal cooperation paradigm and partnership to \neffectively address new changes and challenges in \ninternational development cooperation. \n The cost of reckless economic growth that \nignores environmental warnings will be beyond \nimagination. The rise in the Earth\u2019s temperature due to \ngreenhouse gas emissions has caused abnormal \nclimatic phenomena. Ecosystem damage due to the \ngreenhouse effect is causing enormous economic \ndamage in various parts of the world. \n To protect our environment and promote growth \nat the same time, we must use less fossil fuel and more \nrenewable energy, while promoting the safer use of \nnuclear energy. Green technology devoted to meeting \nthese goals will create more jobs for people and will \nenable us to attain sustainable economic growth in \ndecades to come. \n Having designated \u201cgreen growth\u201d as a national \ngrowth paradigm in 2008, the Republic of Korea has \nbeen actively pursuing this goal. The Republic of \nKorea was the first country in the world to introduce \nthe Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth. We \nare also investing 2 per cent of our national gross \ndevelopment product in green sectors every year. \n Another important development was the launch \nof the Global Green Growth Institute, which was \nfounded by the Republic of Korea along with like-\nminded countries. The aim of the Institute is to share \ncutting-edge green technology and experience with \ndeveloping countries. In so doing, developing countries \nwill be able to join in the global green growth \nmovement and attain economic growth and \nenvironmental protection together as one global \ncommunity. \n The United Nations shall have a more important \nrole than ever to play in restoring the equilibrium in \nthe global ecosystem and promoting shared growth in \nthe international community. In this regard, I welcome \nthe inclusion of \u201cGreen economy in the context of \nsustainable development and poverty eradication\u201d as a \nmain theme of the 2012 United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development. I look forward to the \nConference producing a solid vision and action plan \ntowards economically, socially and environmentally \nsustainable development. \n The North Korean nuclear threat poses significant \nchallenges to peace on the Korean peninsula, North-\nEast Asia and beyond. Over the past 20 years, the \nRepublic of Korea has made consistent diplomatic \nefforts, in cooperation with the international \ncommunity, to achieve the denuclearization of the \nKorean peninsula and will continue to do so. \n In the twenty-first century, we must first work \ntogether if we wish to attain peace and prosperity. This \nis a historical trend in which the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea must take part. It is my hope to see \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea enjoy \npeace and prosperity by becoming a responsible \nmember of the international community. When the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea chooses the \npath to mutual benefit and common prosperity, we will \nbe ready to assist in that endeavour along with the \ninternational community. I sincerely hope that this will \ntransform the Korean peninsula from a place of conflict \nand strife into a bedrock of peace in North-East Asia \nand the world. \n Today, humankind faces a range of unprecedented \ntransnational challenges that require closer \ninternational cooperation than ever before. At this \nhistoric moment, the United Nations will have a greater \nresponsibility and role to play. \n Over the 60 years since the establishment of the \nUnited Nations, the dynamics of international relations \nhave been fundamentally and structurally transformed. \nTo meet the new demands of the times and address the \ndiverse challenges of the future, the United Nations \nshould constantly strive to renew and reinvent itself. In \nparticular, the Security Council should be reformed to \nbecome more democratic and accountable in order to \nfulfil its mandate of maintaining international peace \nand security. The Republic of Korea has been actively \nparticipating in discussions on Security Council \nreform. We will continue to contribute constructively \nto those discussions in the future. \n With the spirit of the Charter of the United \nNations always in our hearts, the Republic of Korea \nwill continue to actively cooperate with the \nOrganization to create a greater United Nations in \ntimes of change."

        "file_text": "Allow me to \ncongratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser \non his election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-sixth session. I would also like to congratulate \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his unanimous \nreappointment to a second term. \n I extend my warmest congratulations to South \nSudan on becoming the newest Member of the United \nNations family. We wish President Al-Nasser and \nSecretary-General Ban success in the year ahead. \n The world has seen difficult times since the \nglobal economic crisis of 2008. This has been \ncompounded by natural and man-made disasters, which \nhave grown in scale and severity. The repercussions of \nthose events produce unpredictable outcomes. \nGovernments have to grapple with the challenge of \nreviving growth and creating jobs for our citizens, even \nas the uncertain global economic recovery comes under \nthreat from the severe fiscal and debt crisis in the \nUnited States and eurozone. Fears about the risk of a \ndouble-dip recession remain. \n Other important global challenges need serious \nattention and resources as well. Those include long-\nterm issues such as sustainable development, climate \nchange and water security. There are also immediate \nconcerns such as food security, job creation and \nmaking our cities more livable. These are issues that \nrequire urgent joint action by the global community. \n By next month, we will have 7 billion people to \nfeed, clothe and find meaningful employment for. That \nis a stark reminder of the magnitude of our task. The \nUnited Nations must play an important role in dealing \nwith these challenges. First, the United Nations, the \nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Trade Organization can help ensure that the \nglobal economic framework remains conducive to \ngrowth amidst the maelstrom of economic instability. \n We are in for a bumpy ride, with growth in all the \nmajor markets slowing, and there is no guarantee of \nquick recovery. At the same time, we face a worrisome \nrise in protectionist sentiments. A recent report by the \nWorld Trade Organization showed that the Group of 20 \n(G-20) countries introduced 122 new trade-restrictive \nmeasures from 2010 to April 2011. Too many countries \nare focused more on domestic political concerns than \non implementing their multilateral commitments and \ntaking concerted action at the global level. That is why \nthe prospects for a breakthrough in the Doha \nDevelopment Round continue to be slim.  \n As the pre-eminent multilateral institution in the \nworld, the United Nations should take a strong stand, \nmake a united pledge against trade-restrictive measures \nand continue to push for free trade. Fighting \nprotectionist pressures collectively is important for the \nlong-term sustainability of our economies. The \nphilosophy of common enrichment that imbues the \nUnited Nations Charter must replace short-sighted \nstrategies of survival if we are to truly take the path \ntowards sustainability. Due to its sheer membership \nsize and functions, the United Nations will need time \nto achieve consensus and make decisions. That leaves \nthe door open for ad hoc coordination by smaller, \ninformal groups, especially during critical periods like \nthe fall of 2008. There is a role for smaller, regional \ngroupings like the G-20 and the Group of Eight, which \nmay be more efficient and dynamic in decision-\nmaking.  \n A certain amount of fluidity is a given in global \ngovernance for some time to come, and even necessary \nin order to tackle increasingly complex and varied \nglobal problems. But ultimately, a balance needs to be \nstruck between efficiency and genuine legitimacy. The \nG-20 accounts for over 80 per cent of world trade and \ngross domestic product, but that still leaves the \nmajority of countries and a significant number of \npeople outside of that group. There is scope for the \nUnited Nations to play a meaningful role by ensuring \nthat all groupings take into account and promote the \ngreater interest. The United Nations must also act \ntogether with such groupings as complementary parts \n \n \n9 11-51670 \n \nof the international system, not as mutually exclusive \ncompetitors. \n The United Nations also has an important role in \ntackling two other challenges \u2014 food and water \nsecurity, which are two sides of the same coin. The \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations has reported an escalation of international food \nprices to levels not seen in decades. And according to \nthe World Bank, rising food costs have pushed \n44 million people into extreme poverty and hunger \nsince June 2010. The hunger crisis in the Horn of \nAfrica is but one face of this devastation. \n Equally critical is the challenge of water security. \nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \nhas pointed out that about one-third of the world\u2019s \npopulation lives in countries with moderate to high \nwater stress, with a disproportionate impact on the \npoor. With current projected global population growth, \nthe task of providing water for human sustenance will \nbecome increasingly difficult, and increasing \ncompetition over this scarce but vital resource may fuel \ninstability and conflict within and between States. \n The United Nations is doing a great deal in both \nareas to proactively foster collaboration among \nMember States. UNEP has long actively addressed the \nwater issue, together with partner United Nations \nagencies and other organizations. Looking ahead, the \nUnited Nations can do more to build synergies of \ntechnology, policy and capacity in this field. In this \nregard, events like the annual World Water Week in \nStockholm come to the forefront of the public\u2019s minds \nwhen talking about championing water issues. \n Likewise, since 2008, Singapore has organized \nthe Singapore International Water Week, a global \nplatform that brings together policymakers, industry \nleaders, experts and practitioners to address challenges, \nshowcase technologies, discover opportunities and \ncelebrate achievements in the water world. In \nSingapore, we have always regarded water as a \nstrategic resource. We have invested considerable \nresources in researching and testing new technologies. \nWe would be happy to share our experiences. \n I am certain that there are also many other \nsuccess stories of countries that have adopted modern \ntechnology and sound policies to overcome their water \ninsecurity. That is why Singapore is happy to be a \nmember of the Green Group, an informal grouping \ninitiated by Slovenia, whose members discuss ways to \naugment our collective experiences in water \nmanagement. That model can be replicated by the \nUnited Nations to include more Member States. \n We also need to look at the processes, procedures \nand leadership within the United Nations. The \nefficiency of our responses can and should be reviewed \nand improved upon. At present, there is a disconnect \nbetween the proliferation of resolutions, which we \ndebate year after year, and actual present realities. \nThere is a great need to coordinate better between New \nYork and the ground. The immense good work in the \nfield that various United Nations personnel, such as our \nhumanitarian and aid workers, are doing has to be \nbetter related to what Member States do at \nHeadquarters. \n While established processes are important, that \nshould not hamper innovative thinking and solutions. \nFor example, we should set definitive timelines and \nspecific objectives for resolutions, and retire others. \nLet us focus on what needs to be done, who should do \nit, and by when it should be done. This will ensure that \nthere are targeted outcomes and real implementation. \nThis may seem like a small, procedural change, but to \nborrow a phrase, sometimes little things can make a \nbig difference.  \n The alternative is to leave the shaping of the new \nglobal governance to other groupings, which will by \ndefinition be less inclusive. That will lead to a further \nmarginalization of the small and the weak. The United \nNations needs to find ways to work with limited \ngroupings as complementary parts of the international \nsystem. This is what the Global Governance Group, or \n3G, has sought to achieve. \n To act as a bridge between the United Nations \nand the Group of 20, the 3G has provided ideas to \nstrengthen the latter\u2019s engagement with the United \nNations. The 3G has focused on areas of ongoing and \npotential cooperation such as development, tackling the \nproblem of food security and fostering the growth of \nlivable cities. It has also called for a comprehensive \napproach to addressing the different factors affecting \nfood security and the volatility of food prices. That \nincludes a call for a renewed political commitment to a \nuniversal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and \nequitable multilateral trading system under the World \nTrade Organization, which we believe is critical to \nachieving food security. \n  \n \n11-51670 10 \n \n The United Nations remains the only truly \nuniversal and international organization. There is no \nalternative to the United Nations. The steady expansion \nof its membership from 51 at its founding in 1945 to \n193 today is a testament to the value that countries \naccord to membership in this Organization. \n The United Nations is uniquely placed to \ninfluence our collective future. However, we should \nnot take this position for granted, for the \nOrganization\u2019s ability to influence global issues is \nultimately dependent on the decisions that we as \nMember States take at the United Nations. \n Sixty-five years ago, following the devastation of \nWorld War II, we managed to forge a consensus that \nwas underpinned by the notion of inclusive global \ncitizenship and manifested by the establishment of a \nset of international institutions, practices and norms. At \nthe forefront was the United Nations Charter.  \n Globalization and economic integration have \nsince redefined global governance and decision-\nmaking. The United Nations needs to adjust its \nprocesses to this new environment. But at the core, its \nvalues remain the same: to maintain international peace \nand security and to promote development, human \nrights and respect for the rule of law. \n It is up to us, the Member States, to rally the \nnecessary political will to put aside narrow self-\ninterests and act for our collective good and secure the \nwell-being of our future generations."

        "file_text": "We join \nprevious speakers in congratulating Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, of Qatar, on his election to \npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. His long diplomatic experience makes us \nanticipate that our deliberations will be crowned with \nsuccess. We take this opportunity to assure him our full \nreadiness to contribute to the success of this session, \nand wish him well in the discharge of his duties. \n We extend our congratulations to the President\u2019s \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss of the Swiss \nConfederation, on his commitment, pragmatism and \ndynamism in the conduct of the work of the sixty-fifth \nsession. \n We also congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \nreappointment to the post of Secretary-General, which \ndemonstrates the recognition of Member States, and of \nthe international community as a whole, of his \ncommitment to the pursuit and consolidation of peace, \nsecurity and international development. We are \nencouraged that, thanks to his full commitment, we \nwill continue to work together, under the aegis of the \nUnited Nations, to find appropriate solutions to \ncommon problems facing humanity. \n We welcome the newest Member of the United \nNations, the Republic of South Sudan. With this sister \ncountry, we celebrated its independence and at that \ntime expressed our congratulations on this important \nmilestone. \n This session takes place at a critical stage of \nhuman history, characterized in particular by the \nimpact of the ongoing global financial and economic \ncrisis; the rising prices of food and oil; the resurgence \nof hotbeds of tension and political instability, \nparticularly in North Africa and the Middle East; the \nprevalence of pandemics such as malaria, tuberculosis \nand HIV/AIDS; and the increasing occurrence of \nnatural disasters. These challenges require a \nmultilateral approach in order to find consensual, \neffective and sustainable responses. \n Indeed, the negative impact of these complex \nphenomena, especially in developing countries, is a \npotential factor of political and social instability. It is \ntherefore necessary to focus on democratic principles \ngrounded on dialogue, inclusive governance, \naccountability and transparency and respect for human \nrights. \n \n \n9 11-50847 \n \n In this context, we commend the choice of theme \nfor the session: the role and importance of mediation \nfor the prevention of violent conflicts, for the pursuit \nof peaceful solutions and for the strengthening and \nconsolidation of mutual trust. Those are key factors for \nbuilding a solid and lasting peace. \n We all yearn for a better world in which peace \nand security, harmony and concord reign, a world in \nwhich everyone\u2019s concern is to combat poverty, fight \nagainst epidemics and promote the welfare and \nprosperity of humankind. \n The proliferation of crises and the perpetuation of \ndissonant positions, rather than a search for solutions \nto the many problems that affect all humanity, make \nthis dream become increasingly difficult to achieve. \nTherefore, strengthening multilateralism and global \ngovernance by the United Nations is of critical \nimportance. \n This session takes place in the year in which the \nUnited Nations family recalls the fiftieth anniversary \nof the physical disappearance of Secretary-General \nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. It is also 25 years since the \nassassination, by apartheid, of our late President \nSamora Mois\u00e9s Machel. Those two personalities were \nlovers and defenders of peace, and they lost their lives \nwhen seeking peace for countries of our Mother Africa. \nIn honour of those great names and all those who gave \ntheir lives to mediation and preventive diplomacy as a \nmeans for the peaceful settlement of disputes, let us all \nreaffirm our commitment to peace, and redouble our \ncommitment in support of initiatives aimed at building \na world free of conflict. \n Mediation should be seen as an opportunity to \nbring together the parties to a dispute, reduce their \ndifferences and appeal to conscience so that together \nthey can move towards mutually acceptable peaceful \nsolutions. Mediation cannot be started with the \nassumption that we have all the answers; the mediation \nprocess should be conducted in an objective, impartial \nand neutral manner, ensuring the involvement of \nstakeholders at all stages and their ownership of the \nprocess. These are basic principles that ensure the \ncontinuity and consolidation of the process of national \nreconciliation and reconstruction, and, more important, \nthe building of mutual trust. \n Aware of these principles, Mozambique is proud \nto be part of some positive experiences in different \nmediation processes in southern Africa and the African \ncontinent as a whole. We have thus contributed to \nhelping other countries to return to the path leading to \nsocial and economic development. We therefore appeal \nfor appreciation of the mediation role of the United \nNations and regional and subregional organizations. \n The universality of the United Nations gives it a \nkey role in promoting international peace and security \nby resorting to peaceful means to settle disputes. In \nthis sense, the Organization is once again called upon \nto assume the responsibility entrusted to it in the \nCharter as a facilitator of mediation within the concert \nof nations, through its organs, in particular the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly, as well as through \nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \n We praise the progress made by the United \nNations, whose impact on prevention, mitigation and \nmediation of internal and inter-State conflicts has been \npositive. These achievements can be consolidated by \nstrengthening the relationship between the principal \norgans of the United Nations with a mandate to \nsafeguard international peace and security, as well as \ntheir relationship with regional and subregional \norganizations. \n We reaffirm our recognition of the role of the \nregional and subregional organizations as pillars in the \npromotion and maintenance of peace, security and \nstability through the use of preventive diplomacy and \nearly warning systems. \n The African experience has proved that the \nvarious regional and subregional mediation initiatives \nhave been effective in preventing and managing \nconflicts and tensions, and in maintaining regional \npeace and stability. In this context, we salute the \nsignature of the political road map leading to the return \nto constitutional order in Madagascar, the culmination \nof a negotiating process, mediated by the Southern \nAfrican Development Community, which started in \nAugust 2009. \n The United Nations remains the appropriate \nforum for addressing current challenges, including the \npeaceful resolution of disputes. However, in order to \nassume its role effectively, our Organization must \ncomplete the ongoing reforms.  \n In this sense, we reiterate the commitment of the \nRepublic of Mozambique to continue to provide \nrelevant input to the reform process, which helps the \nUnited Nations to become more proactive and effective \n  \n \n11-50847 10 \n \nin dealing with global issues, thus contributing to the \nconsolidation of its credibility and legitimacy, in the \ninterests of the peoples of the world. In this regard, we \nreiterate our interest in seeing the conclusion of the \nprocess of revitalization of the role and authority of the \nGeneral Assembly as a more representative and \nlegitimate body of the United Nations.  \n It is in this Assembly, where we are all \nrepresented and where every vote counts, that the most \nimportant decisions on the international agenda, \nincluding the peaceful and negotiated settlement of \ndisputes, should be taken and evaluated. Only a strong \nGeneral Assembly, endowed with the necessary \nauthority and competence and adequate resources, \nwould be up to these responsibilities and current \nchallenges. \n Another important component of reform that \ncontinues to deserve our attention is the Security \nCouncil. This body should, in a transparent, inclusive \nand democratic manner, follow the evolution and \ndynamics of contemporary global challenges and \nassume its vital role in building the credibility of the \nUnited Nations as a universal entity. We are confident \nthat these reforms will allow greater dialogue and \ncooperation between the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council, strengthening the relationship with \neach other and with relevant regional and subregional \norganizations. \n We have been following with due attention the \nsocial and political developments in North Africa and \nthe Middle East. We recognize that these developments \npose a challenge for the countries and regions \nconcerned and also for the international community. \nWe are hopeful that the processes in progress will \ncapitalize on opportunities to promote peace, expand \nfreedoms, promote development and improve living \nconditions. We call upon all relevant actors to engage \nin constructive dialogue and work for peaceful \nsolutions to ensure peace and stability. \n From those developments we have learned the \nlesson that internal dialogue, regional cooperation, and \nfairness in the interventions of the United Nations \nshould be privileged. \n We note with concern the lack of progress in the \nIsraeli-Arab peace process. In this context, we urge the \nparties to commit themselves to relaunching \nnegotiations that are translated into concrete actions \nwith a view to a lasting, comprehensive and fair \nconflict solution. We reiterate our unequivocal support \nfor the cause of the Palestinian people, who have been \ndenied the inalienable right to self-determination. \n We reaffirm our support for the principle of the \ncreation of two States, Palestine and Israel, coexisting \npeacefully and in accordance with the 1967 borders. \nWe also reiterate our support for the commitment of \nthe international community to finding a sustainable \nsolution in favour of the people of Western Sahara. We \nalso reiterate our support for their legitimate right to \nself-determination. \n We take this opportunity to express our solidarity \nwith the brotherly peoples of Somalia, Ethiopia and \nKenya, plagued by severe drought and famine. We \npraise the efforts that the international community has \nmade so far to alleviate the suffering and loss of life.  \n Finally, we reaffirm the continued engagement \nand commitment of the Republic of Mozambique to \npeace, security and stability."

        "file_text": "It is indeed \nan honour and a source of pride to see our sister State \nof Qatar represented in the good person of the \n  \n \n11-51390 18 \n \nPresident leading this year\u2019s session of the General \nAssembly. His election was certainly the right choice \ngiven his commendable initiatives and contributions to \nmaintaining peace and security, both regionally and \ninternationally, which bear out his qualifications and \ncapabilities. Indeed, we congratulate him on assuming \nhis post. Through you, Sir, may I also convey my \ncongratulations and gratitude to Mr. Joseph Deiss, \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  \n We would also like to congratulate His Excellency \nthe Secretary-General on his reappointment. We commend \nhim and his colleagues on their admirable efforts in the \nvarious areas in which the Organization is active. We \nhope that our deliberations this year will benefit \nhumankind and serve to promote peace, harmony and \ncooperation among peoples and nations.  \n I address the Assembly today as the Sudan \napproaches the international community with new \nmomentum, having recently provided an exemplary \nmodel in choosing peace and stability, even though \ntheir price entailed sacrificing a dear part of our \ncountry\u2019s territory. During the past six years, the \ninternational community has followed the Government \nof the Sudan\u2019s degree of commitment to the choice of \npeace through the implementation of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement, which we concluded \nand signed on 9 January 2005.  \n Despite the obstacles and challenges facing the \nimplementation of the Agreement from the start, we \nhave continued to implement it with perseverance and \npatience. That culminated in the holding of the \nreferendum on the self-determination of South Sudan \nand, eventually, the acceptance of its result. We were \nthe first country to recognize the nascent Republic of \nSouth Sudan, extending a hand of cooperation and \nbrotherhood to it.  \n The international community has also followed \nthe historic visit that our country\u2019s President, Mr. Omer \nHassan Al-Bashir, paid to the city of Juba prior to the \nholding of the referendum, as well as his participation \nin the celebrations declaring the establishment of the \nState of South Sudan on 9 July. His address on that \noccasion outlined the guiding principles that \nestablished the basis of our warm and friendly \nrelations, discarding the negative atmosphere and \nbitterness of the past and looking towards the broader \nhorizons of cooperation and communication that serve \nthe interests of that country\u2019s brotherly people. From \nthis rostrum, we reiterate our commitment to that spirit. \nWe also reiterate our congratulations to the State of \nSouth Sudan as it takes its place among the Members \nof the United Nations.  \n Allow me to take this opportunity to welcome the \nNational Transitional Council as the legitimate \nrepresentative of the brotherly people of Libya at the \nUnited Nations, following the revolution that Libya \nexperienced and the changes it has brought about. \n The separation leading to the establishment of the \nindependent State of South Sudan does not mean a \ndefinitive divorce, in particular as we live in an era of \nglobalization and State alliances and groupings that \ntranscend political boundaries and traditional \nframeworks. Moreover, until recently our two peoples \nwere one, connected by common denominators and \nvarious historical, cultural and social ties. \n Given those facts, we are resolute in our full \ncommitment to settling all outstanding issues with \nregard to the implementation of the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement, including the situation in the Abyei \nregion, in order to complete the border demarcation \nand the necessary joint measures and mechanisms \nrequired to monitor the border and address economic \nissues, including access to oil and oil revenues.  \n We also affirm that we are committed to reaching \nsecurity and political arrangements that address all the \nrecent tensions in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile \nstates. As I have said before, we accepted the choice of \nseparation not because we were bored with unity, for \nwe had paid dearly for that unity, but because we \nwanted sustainable peace and stability. It is therefore \nunacceptable and irrational to accept any proxy war \nthat destabilizes those two states, or any other border \narea between them. That will require understanding of \nthe joint vision that takes into account the special \ncharacteristics of the demographic character of the \nregion and the interaction among the tribes in those \nareas. \n With regard to the situation in Darfur, the most \nrecent peace negotiations in the sisterly State of Qatar \nconcluded with the signing of the Doha Document for \nPeace in Darfur, which was accepted and supported by \nthe various groups in Darfur. That support was \nevidenced by the broad participation in the all-Darfur \nstakeholders conference, which was held in May and \nattended by representatives of internally displaced \npersons, civil society and leaders from the legislative, \n \n \n19 11-51390 \n \npolitical and executive branches, as well as tribal and \npolitical party leaders, elders and local administration. \nThe conference adopted the Doha Document for Peace \nin Darfur because it responded to all of the aspirations \nof the people of Darfur in terms of peace, development, \nstability, justice and political participation. As the \nAssembly is aware, the Document has received \nconsiderable support from the international community.  \n I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our \nappreciation to our sister State of Qatar, the African \nUnion and the League of Arab States, which \nspearheaded this initiative. We also wish to thank the \nJoint Mediation Support Team and all regional and \ninternational partners who contributed to the \nagreement. From this rostrum, I again emphasize that \nwe will continue to implement our national strategy on \nDarfur on the basis of its five pillars: security, \ndevelopment, the resettlement of refugees and \ninternally displaced persons, internal reconciliation and \na comprehensive political settlement. We will give top \npriority to completing the return of internally displaced \npersons and refugees and to creating stable conditions \nfor them through development, rehabilitation and \nreconstruction projects.  \n We expected the Secretary-General to include a \nspecial paragraph in his statement to illustrate my \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to peace, which was \nevident from the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement and the declaration of the Republic of \nSouth Sudan, which my Government was first to \nrecognize as a State. We call on our international \nOrganization not to be hoodwinked by the policies of \nsome countries, which refuse to give credit where it is \ndue. The Sudanese leadership, headed by President \nOmer Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir, enabled the people of \nthe South to exercise their right to self-determination. \nIt made a commitment to do so because of its desire for \npeace and stability. Consequently, it is a leadership that \ndeserves respect and appreciation, not to be the target \nof attempts at incrimination or of the arbitrary levelling \nof accusations, for example, by the International \nCriminal Court.  \n I need not recall the fact that the President is the \nleader of the Republic of the Sudan and was \nlegitimately elected in fair and transparent elections \nconducted under the supervision of international and \nregional bodies. Moreover, the unilateral and \nunjustified economic sanctions adopted by the United \nStates of America against the Sudan in order to weaken \nit and erode its development revival are but unjust and \ncoercive measures against the people of the Sudan. \nThis is happening at a time when we aspire to have the \nsupport of the international community as we move \ntowards that goal more openly and with greater \ndetermination to fulfil our natural role as an active and \npioneering member of the international family.  \n As a State emerging from conflict, we look \nforward to the contribution of the international \ncommunity and its financial institutions in terms of \ndebt forgiveness and support for development projects. \nThat would be consistent with the measures being \napplied to all least developed countries, as well as to \nthose emerging from conflict and moving into \npeacebuilding, which has now become a reality. The \nWorld Bank has put forward these and other \nrequirements, and has stated that my country has \nindeed demonstrated compliance in that regard. \n Similarly, from this rostrum, we call on all \ninvestors, without exception, to try to benefit from the \nSudan and its promising resources, especially those \nother than oil, such as mineral resources and metals. \nWe urge them to invest in the Sudan\u2019s agricultural \nresources, taking into consideration the extent of the \ncountry\u2019s arable land and its significant water \nresources. This is particularly important in the light of \nthe food crises, famines resulting from drought and \ndesertification, and the urgent global need for cereals \nand grains. The Sudan\u2019s investment law has provided \nall necessary facilities to all foreign investors. \n The international financial and economic crisis \nhas adversely affected most countries of the world. In \nthe countries of Africa, the crisis has notably \nintensified and exacerbated the difficulties plaguing the \neconomies of developing nations, resulting in increased \npoverty and food shortages and the decline of social \nservices.  \n At a time when climate change is leading to \nnatural disasters in many countries, I call on the \nGeneral Assembly, all donors and the relevant United \nNations agencies, funds and programmes to respond \nurgently to the devastating famine and the attendant \ntragic humanitarian situation, which is affecting some \nof our sister republics in the Horn of Africa, in \nparticular Somalia. \n We also wish to highlight the importance of \ngiving issues affecting the African continent a high \npriority on the development agenda of the United \n  \n \n11-51390 20 \n \nNations, with a view to supporting and building the \ncapacities of African economic institutions. This could \nbe accomplished by reactivating the New Partnership \nfor Africa\u2019s Development initiative. Priority, support \nand financing should be given to projects aimed at \ncombating poverty and endemic diseases on the \ncontinent, as well as to the relevant programmes linked \nto the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals.  \n Since development and peace go hand in hand, \nwe wish to emphasize the importance of supporting the \ninstitutions of the African Union, especially its Peace \nand Security Council and its other various mechanisms, \nto build early-warning conflict prevention capacities. I \nneed not mention that Chapter VIII of the United \nNations Charter clearly emphasizes the importance of \nregional arrangements in strengthening and \nmaintaining international peace and security.  \n We also wish to emphasize the importance of \nactivating preventive diplomacy mechanisms and \nAfrican peacemaking efforts. I refer in particular to the \nexperience of the Panel of the Wise of the African \nUnion, headed by former South African President \nThabo Mbeki, which is playing a commendable role in \nthe Sudan. This attests to the effectiveness of the role \nof regional bodies in settling disputes and achieving \npeace and security in African countries. \n The Sudan had hoped for international consensus \non climate and environment issues, in particular \nbecause we have been directly affected by them, as has \nclearly been the case in Darfur. United Nations reports \nhave emphasized the relationship between the negative \nimpact of climate change and the intensification of \nconflict, especially on the African continent. We had \nalso hoped that the efforts made in Copenhagen would \nhave been successful and led to an agreement on how \nto address this phenomenon and avoid its negative \nconsequences.  \n We had hoped, too, that developed nations would \nassume their historic responsibilities in that regard by \nadopting specific strategies and action plans to tackle \nthe root causes of climate change in a manner \nconsistent with the Rio Declaration on Environment \nand Development, adopted at the Earth Summit in \n1992. The Sudan attaches the highest priority to the \nimplementation of a series of national programmes \ndesigned to alleviate the consequences of climate \nchange and to raise awareness as to its dire effects. \n The Sudan looks forward to participating actively \nand effectively in the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development to be held next year, in order \nto help strengthen international efforts to face the \nchallenges of sustainable development with a \ncollective will that reflects the aspirations of the whole \nworld, developing nations in particular, for \ndevelopment and a decent life for their peoples. \n Various entities of the United Nations, including \nthe Security Council, have adopted dozens of \nresolutions regarding the question of Palestine, none of \nwhich have been implemented. This is because of \nIsrael\u2019s blatant defiance of the international community \nand because of the support and protection it enjoys \nfrom some powerful countries. This demonstrates that \nthe Organization is incapable of standing up for the \nrights of peoples and to support their legitimate claims, \nas enshrined in the Charter. That has given the green \nlight to the occupying authorities to continue with their \nsettlement policies that seek to entrench the occupation \nand banish the Palestinian people, the owners of the \nland. \n The Sudan therefore fully supports the \nPalestinian National Authority\u2019s decision to request full \nmembership of the United Nations, which is their legal \nright, based on the right to self-determination, one of \nthe principles of international law. Moreover, the \nPalestinians\u2019 request for recognition as a State is a \nlegitimate right that seeks to confirm that, first, the \nUnited Nations is committed to its Charter and, \nsecondly, to international law. This would also help to \nalleviate tensions in the region. The international \ncommunity should consider the fact that there may be \nno one to negotiate with if it allows Israel to impose \nconditions on the world and to deprive the Palestinians \nof their legitimate rights. \n In conclusion, the reform of the United Nations, \nand in particular of the Security Council, is an urgent \nand compelling priority requiring speedy action. \nWithout efforts to reform the Organization and its \nvarious entities, we will weaken the role of developing \nnations and have a negative effect on their national \ninterests. This will also allow bodies such as the \nSecurity Council to become a channel through which \nparticular countries impose their own political agendas, \nespecially with regard to international peace and \nsecurity. Genuine reform of the Security Council and \nits working methods is therefore the only way to \nprevent it from being exploited by some countries in a \n \n \n21 11-51390 \n \nmanner that could cast doubt on the credibility and \nneutrality of the Organization, whose founders \ncarefully drafted its Charter so as to make it the widest \npossible forum for consultation and debate \u2014 debate \nthat requires cooperation and interaction among \npeoples, nations, cultures and civilizations in order to \ncreate a world in which values such as freedom, peace, \nsecurity and justice can prevail."

        "file_text": "\nI begin by saluting Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, \nwho presides over the current session. His long \nexperience at the United Nations augurs well for our \nwork.  \n I also acknowledge the outstanding work of \nMr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland, the outgoing \nPresident. Our delegation worked very closely with \nMr. Deiss, and we can testify to his exceptional \ncommitment to the United Nations and his immense \ncapacity for work. \n I also salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I \nreiterate our appreciation of his management, and \ncongratulate him on his re-election for a second five-\nyear term. I thank him for the support he has given to \nmy country and Central America, shown especially by \nhis recent visit to Guatemala. \n My presence at every General Assembly session \nduring the four years of my presidency testifies to our \nbacking for the United Nations and our gratitude for its \nsupport. \n This occasion is unique, for two reasons.  \n First, I can tell the Assembly about the \nachievements of my Administration over the past four \nyears and also about some pending issues. Secondly, I \ncan report that just 10 days ago the first round of \ngeneral elections was held in my country, in a calm, \nnormal climate with broad citizen participation, thus \nconsolidating our progress towards a democratic and \nparticipatory society. \n Let me then start with a few words about the \nprogress made in Guatemala, despite the exceptional \nobstacles created by the international financial crisis of \n2008-2009, a severe political crisis in Guatemala in \n2009 that was overcome in compliance with the rule of \nlaw and truth revealed by investigations, and the \nimpact of three major natural disasters, which led to a \n109-day state of emergency, as well as historical \nchallenges that we face now and shall face in the \nfuture. \n  \n \n11-50847 2 \n \n I shall sum up in a few words the significance of \nmy period in office, as follows. \n First, my Administration gave priority to the \nindividual by dealing with social issues that had not \nbeen addressed for 50 years. We have tried to reduce \npoverty and extreme poverty, with tangible results, \nespecially through our social cohesion programmes, \nparticularly conditional transfers of cash to mothers of \nextremely poor families \u2014 more than 940,000 families. \n Second, space was recovered for the State in \nareas previously dominated corporately by private \ninterests. \n Third, we began to contain and reverse a \nshocking escalation of the criminal violence that had \nstarted in earlier periods, by reorganizing the security \nforces and promoting policies that confronted, instead \nof coexisting with, organized crime. \n Fourth, in accordance with those measures, we \nrecovered whole territories previously dominated by \ndrug traffickers, particularly the Mayan biosphere in \nthe northern Department of Pet\u00e9n, consisting of more \nthan 138,000 hectares; 48,000 head of cattle were \nexpelled from the area, and the Government has \nretaken control of it. Unprecedented seizures of drugs \nhave taken place. In three and a half years we have \nseized $12 billion, the equivalent of almost two \nnational budgets. By comparison, over the eight-year \nperiod before my Government came to power scarcely \n$1 billion was seized. \n However much we do in the Central American \nregion, Mexico and Colombia, it is essential that drug \nconsumption be controlled. Drug-consuming countries \nmust accept co-responsibility for the daily killings in \nour countries, and for the uncontrolled sales of arms \nentering it. They must take co-responsibility for the \ncontrol of money-laundering and of arms, which bring \ndeath to our region, and for the control of factories \nproducing chemical precursors for drug production. \nResponsibility must be taken for the destination of the \nproducts and arms. \n We cannot control organized crime in Central \nAmerica without the support of Mexico and Colombia. \nWe can win the battle only if the consumer markets do \ntheir share. We cannot go on shedding blood and being \nwounded by bullets. That is unfair. The consumer \nmarkets must assume true co-responsibility. \n Fifth, a series of wide-ranging policies was \nadopted to gain greater transparency. They included the \ncreation of the Secretariat for Transparency and the \nadoption of a law on public information. \n Sixth, the energy matrix was renewed and \nupgraded to make it more environmentally sound and \nto counter the effects of the rising cost of \nhydrocarbons. \n Seventh, we promoted two major economic \ncorridors in poverty-stricken regions. In addition, the \nconstruction of the Northern Transversal Strip will \nunite the Mexican State of Chiapas with our neighbour, \nHonduras, and Polochic. \n Eighth, we pursued a dynamic foreign policy, \nputting the Central American region on a new footing \nand making possible a closer understanding with our \nneighbours of Latin America and the Caribbean. I shall \nreturn to this matter a little later. \n Ninth, municipal power was given full respect \nand strengthened, being recognized as a fourth power \nin the democratic system. \n Tenth, the independence of the different branches \nof the State was faithfully respected. \n Finally, while everything that I have described \nwas achieved we preserved and improved a solid, \nstable macroeconomic system. Guatemala is one of the \nthree countries that had no shrinkage of their economy \nduring the financial crisis. \n Some important topics require the participation of \nevery State institution; we need legislation by the \nCongress of the Republic and rulings by the \ninstitutions that constitute the country\u2019s judicial \nsystem. Among other matters, I wish to refer to the \nstruggle we have waged against impunity, experienced \nin Guatemala for many years. Seven of the most \nwanted drug traffickers, who are known to all \nGuatemalans, are now in jail, awaiting trial. The \nGovernment has initiated trials for crimes against \nhumanity committed during our 36-year civil war, \nwhich ended in 1996. Sentence has already been passed \nin some cases, and other trials are continuing. \n Here I wish to highlight the crucial role played by \nthe United Nations through the International \nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala, a unique \nUnited Nations exercise which enjoys the strong \nsupport of not only my Government, but also \n \n \n3 11-50847 \n \nGuatemalan civil society. We are pleased that the \nCommission\u2019s mandate has been extended for two \nmore years, until September 2013. We recognize the \nsignificant achievements it has recorded since its \nestablishment. \n Among the main challenges facing us, I wish to \nmention the following. \n First, despite the progress in social matters, we \nmust acknowledge how much remains to be done to \neliminate poverty and raise the level of wellbeing of \nthe Guatemalan population. There were many years of \nneglect, especially of the most vulnerable, such as \nchildren, single mothers, and a disproportionate part of \nthe indigenous population.  \n I am convinced that the actions taken should be \ninstitutionalized through social cohesion programmes \nand presidential programmes. That will require a \nsubstantial fiscal transformation to provide the State \nwith the necessary funds. It should be recognized that \nthat is not possible without the support and \nparticipation of Congress, even where the Central \nGovernment promotes it, as in my case.  \n In economic matters we need a revival of \nproductive activities in a framework of financial \nstability and fiscal reform compatible with financing \nfor development. \n Secondly, due to our geographical location, \nGuatemala has become an important transit point for \nillicit activities, including drug trafficking and human \ntrafficking, both of which are increasingly in the hands \nof transnational organized crime. We have made \nstrenuous efforts to deal with them and to address the \npublic demand for improved security for every citizen.  \n It is essential to have regional and international \ncooperation. Member countries of the Central \nAmerican Integration System have adopted a historic \nCentral American Security Strategy, which was jointly \npresented, with the support of the Governments of \nColombia and Mexico, to the international community \nat an international conference held in Guatemala on \n22 and 23 June. The main point is that we have acted \nforcefully, but that it is imperative to implement the \n22 projects that need funding. \n Here I recall the words of President Calder\u00f3n of \nMexico at the June conference, when he asked what \npeace there would be in Central America, and Mexico \nand Colombia, if we were north of Canada; if we \nsimply changed our geographic position we would \neliminate the problem of drug trafficking. Once again I \nstress the co-responsibility of the drug-consuming \nmarkets. \n Thirdly, it is difficult to promote development \nwhen we repeatedly face severe natural disasters, \nwhich recently have been occurring at a rate of at least \none a year. This can be attributed, at least in part, to \nclimate change, given the high vulnerability of Central \nAmerica to the effects of this phenomenon. Therefore, \nit is imperative that humanity close ranks in defence of \nour common habitat: our planet. So far, progress has \nbeen minimal. We urge the international community to \nredouble efforts to take tangible steps at the next \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Durban, South Africa, in December. \n In my previous statements to the Assembly, I \nhave concluded with references to our foreign policy, \nespecially as it affects, or is impacted by, the United \nNations agenda. \n My Government has developed an active foreign \npolicy, which includes strengthening the integration \nprocess in the framework of the Central American \nIntegration System. We are confident that, as part of \nthat active policy, in some three weeks we shall attain \none of our main objectives at the multilateral level \u2014 \nGuatemala\u2019s election by the General Assembly to a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nnext biennium. This will renew our commitment to the \nUnited Nations, and also strengthen our foreign policy, \nexposing us to a broad and complex diplomatic agenda. \nWe shall carry out our work with responsibility and \nindependence, and with respect for the principles and \nvalues enshrined in the Charter.  \n I thank our regional group, the Latin American \nand Caribbean Group, for endorsing our candidature, \nand I thank all Member States in advance for the \nsupport that I trust we shall receive when new \nmembers are elected to the Security Council. \n The central theme of the session is mediation. I \nreiterate our full commitment to strengthening \npreventive diplomacy and the instruments that the \nUnited Nations possesses to prevent conflicts. In this \ncontext, we can even accept sanctions regimes, \nprovided that they come about as a result of collective \ndecisions taken by the Security Council.  \n  \n \n11-50847 4 \n \n The other side of the coin is that we reject \nsanctions and coercive measures taken unilaterally. In \nthis regard, we urge the Government of the United \nStates of America to abandon the economic embargo of \nthe Republic of Cuba. We believe that such a step \nwould have many favourable consequences in both \ncountries.  \n We are following closely, and with hope, the \nevents affecting several countries of North Africa, \nwhich will give a greater voice to their peoples. \nClearly, it is up to them to decide their own destiny. \n But in the midst of the current turbulent situation, \nit is not possible to delay a solution to the secular \nconflict resulting from the confrontation between the \nState of Israel and its neighbours. We support the \ncreation of a viable and prosperous Palestinian State \nliving in peace and harmony, behind secure and \ndefensible borders, side by side with the State of Israel. \nWe understand that the international community can \ntake part in the process of fulfilling that vision, as \nindeed is happening through the so-called Quartet \ncomprising the United States, the Russian Federation, \nthe European Union and the United Nations, but its \nrealization is up to the two parties \u2014 Israel and \nPalestine \u2014 and should be achieved through direct \nnegotiations to resolve all outstanding issues. \n We reiterate our commitment to the relaunching \nof the regional integration process of the Central \nAmerican Integration System to bring about even \ncloser relations with our neighbours of the Caribbean \nand Latin America, and we enthusiastically support the \ncreation of the Community of Latin American and \nCaribbean States. \n In another crucial area, we regard as an important \nstep towards resolving our age-old territorial dispute \nwith Belize the signing of the Special Agreement, \nwhich, when the domestic juridical processes are \nconcluded, will enable both countries to seek a legal \nsolution through the International Court of Justice. I \nam pleased to report that the Congress of Guatemala \nhas approved the Agreement unanimously. The next \nstep will be to submit it to a national referendum. \n In the ancestral Mayan calendar today is the day \nof balance, the day of dawn, the day that the \nGuacamaya sings, announcing the coming of a new \ndawn. Today we have come together to witness a new \ndawn. It should be the dawn of peace, the dawn of less \npoverty, the dawn of harmony and above all the dawn \nof respect for fundamental human rights."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to \nbe here today. I would like to talk to the General \nAssembly about a subject that is at the heart of the \nUnited Nations \u2014 the pursuit of peace in an imperfect \nworld. \n War and conflict have been with us since the \nbeginning of civilization. But in the first part of the \ntwentieth century, the advance of modern weaponry led \nto death on a staggering scale. It was that killing that \n  \n \n11-50692 10 \n \ncompelled the founders of this body to build an \ninstitution that was focused not just on ending one war, \nbut on averting others; a union of sovereign States that \nwould seek to prevent conflict while also addressing its \ncauses. \n No American did more to pursue that objective \nthan President Franklin Roosevelt. He knew that a \nvictory in war was not enough. As he said at one of the \nvery first meetings on the founding of the United \nNations, \u201cWe have got to make not merely peace, but a \npeace that will last\u201d. \n The men and women who built this institution \nunderstood that peace is more than the absence of war. \nA lasting peace \u2014 for nations and individuals \u2014 \ndepends upon a sense of justice and opportunity; of \ndignity and freedom. It depends upon struggle and \nsacrifice; on compromise and on a sense of common \nhumanity. \n One delegate to the San Francisco Conference, \nwhich led to the creation of the United Nations, put it \nwell: \n \u201cMany people have talked as if all we had to do \nto get peace was to say loudly and frequently that \nwe loved peace and hated war. Now we have \nlearned that no matter how much we love peace \nand hate war, we cannot avoid having war \nbrought upon us if there are convulsions in other \nparts of the world\u201d. \n The fact is, peace is hard, but our people demand \nit. Over nearly seven decades, even as the United \nNations helped avert a third world war, we still live in \na world scarred by conflict and plagued by poverty. \nEven as we proclaim our love for peace and hatred of \nwar, there are still convulsions in our world that \nendanger us all. \n I took office at a time of two wars for the United \nStates. Moreover, the violent extremists who drew us \ninto war in the first place \u2014 Osama bin Laden and his \nAl-Qaida organization \u2014 remained at large. Today, we \nhave set a new direction. \n At the end of this year, America\u2019s military \noperation in Iraq will be over. We will have a normal \nrelationship with a sovereign nation that is a member \nof the community of nations. That equal partnership \nwill be strengthened by our support for Iraq \u2014 for its \nGovernment and its security forces, for its people and \ntheir aspirations. \n As we end the war in Iraq, the United States and \nour coalition partners have begun a transition in \nAfghanistan. Between now and 2014, an increasingly \ncapable Afghan Government and security forces will \nstep forward to take responsibility for the future of \ntheir country. As they do, we are drawing down our \nown forces, while building an enduring partnership \nwith the Afghan people. \n So let there be no doubt: the tide of war is \nreceding. When I took office, roughly 180,000 Americans \nwere serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. By the end of \nthis year, that number will be cut in half, and it will \ncontinue to decline. This is critical for the sovereignty \nof Iraq and Afghanistan, and to the strength of the \nUnited States as we build our nation at home. \n Moreover, we are poised to end these wars from a \nposition of strength. Ten years ago, there was an open \nwound and twisted steel; a broken heart in the centre of \nthis city. Today, as a new tower is rising at Ground \nZero, it symbolizes New York\u2019s renewal, even as \nAl-Qaida is under more pressure than ever before. Its \nleadership has been degraded. Osama bin Laden, a man \nwho murdered thousands of people from dozens of \ncountries, will never endanger the peace of the world \nagain. \n Yes, this has been a difficult decade. But today \nwe stand at a crossroads of history, with the chance to \nmove decisively in the direction of peace. To do so we \nmust return to the wisdom of those who created this \ninstitution.  \n The founding Charter of United Nations calls \nupon us, to unite our strength to maintain international \npeace and security. Article 1 of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights reminds us that, \u201cAll \nhuman beings are born free and equal in dignity and in \nrights\u201d. Those bedrock beliefs \u2014 in the responsibility \nof States and the rights of men and women \u2014 must be \nour guide. \n In that effort, we have reason to hope. This year \nhas been a time of extraordinary transformation. More \nnations have stepped forward to maintain international \npeace and security. More individuals are claiming their \nuniversal right to live in freedom and dignity. \n Think about it. One year ago, when we met here \nin New York, the prospect of a successful referendum \nin South Sudan was in doubt. But the international \ncommunity overcame old divisions to support the \n \n \n11 11-50692 \n \nagreement that had been negotiated to give South \nSudan self-determination. Last summer, as a new flag \nwent up in Juba, former soldiers laid down their arms, \nmen and women wept with joy and children finally \nknew the promise of looking to a future that they will \nshape. \n One year ago, the people of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \napproached a landmark election. When the incumbent \nlost and refused to respect the results, the world \nrefused to look the other way. United Nations \npeacekeepers were harassed, but they did not leave \ntheir posts. The Security Council, led by the United \nStates, Nigeria and France, came together to support \nthe will of the people. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is now governed \nby the man who was elected to lead. \n One year ago, the hopes of the people of Tunisia \nwere suppressed. But they chose the dignity of \npeaceful protest over the rule of an iron fist. A vendor \nlit a spark that took his own life, but ignited a \nmovement. In the face of a crackdown, students spelled \nout the word freedom. The balance of fear shifted from \nthe ruler to those whom he ruled. Now the people of \nTunisia are preparing for elections that will move them \none step closer to the democracy that they deserve. \n One year ago, Egypt had known one President for \nnearly 30 years. But for 18 days, the eyes of the world \nwere glued to Tahrir Square, where Egyptians from all \nwalks of life \u2014 men and women, young and old, \nMuslim and Christian \u2014 demanded their universal \nrights. We saw in those protesters the moral force of \nnon-violence that has lit the world from Delhi to \nWarsaw, from Selma to South Africa \u2014 and we knew \nthat change had come to Egypt and to the Arab world. \n One year ago, the people of Libya were ruled by \nthe world\u2019s longest-serving dictator. But faced with \nbullets and bombs and a dictator who threatened to \nhunt them down like rats, they showed relentless \nbravery. We will never forget the words of the Libyan \nwho stood up in those early days of the revolution and \nsaid, \u201cOur words are free now\u201d. It is a feeling one \ncannot explain. Day after day, in the face of bullets and \nbombs, the Libyan people refused to give back that \nfreedom. And when they were threatened by the kind \nof mass atrocity that often went unchallenged in the \npast century, the United Nations lived up to its Charter. \nThe Security Council authorized all necessary \nmeasures to prevent a massacre. The Arab League \ncalled for that effort. Arab nations joined a NATO-led \ncoalition that halted Al-Qadhafi\u2019s forces in their tracks. \n In the months that followed, the will of the \ncoalition proved unbreakable, and the will of the \nLibyan people could not be denied. Forty-two years of \ntyranny were ended in six months. From Tripoli to \nMisurata to Benghazi \u2014 today, Libya is free. \nYesterday, the leaders of a new Libya took their \nrightful place beside us, and this week the United \nStates is reopening our embassy in Tripoli. \n This is how the international community is \nsupposed to work \u2014 nations standing together for the \nsake of peace and security, and individuals claiming \ntheir rights. Now, all of us have a responsibility to \nsupport the new Libya and the new Libyan \nGovernment as they confront the challenge of turning \nthis moment of promise into a just and lasting peace \nfor all Libyans. \n So this has been a remarkable year. The \nAl-Qadhafi regime is over. Gbagbo, Ben Ali and \nMubarak are no longer in power. Osama bin Laden is \ngone, and the idea that change could come only \nthrough violence has been buried with him. Something \nis happening in our world. The way things have been is \nnot the way that they will be. The humiliating grip of \ncorruption and tyranny is being pried open. Dictators \nare on notice. Technology is putting power into the \nhands of the people. Youth are delivering a powerful \nrebuke to dictatorship and rejecting the lie that some \nraces, some peoples, some religions and some \nethnicities do not desire democracy. The promise \nwritten down on paper \u2014 \u201call human beings are born \nfree and equal in dignity and rights\u201d \u2014 is closer at \nhand. \n But let us remember: Peace is hard. Peace is hard. \nProgress can be reversed. Prosperity comes slowly. \nSocieties can split apart. The measure of our success \nmust be whether people can live in sustained freedom, \ndignity and security. And the United Nations and its \nMember States must do their part to support those \nbasic aspirations. And we have more work to do. \n In Iran, we have seen a Government that refuses \nto recognize the rights of its own people. As we meet \nhere today, men, women and children are being \ntortured, detained and murdered by the Syrian regime. \nThousands have been killed, many during the holy time \nof Ramadan. Thousands more have poured across \nSyria\u2019s borders. The Syrian people have shown dignity \n  \n \n11-50692 12 \n \nand courage in their pursuit of justice, protesting \npeacefully, standing silently in the streets and dying for \nthe same values that this institution is supposed to \nstand for. And the question for us is clear: Will we \nstand with the Syrian people or with their oppressors? \n Already, the United States has imposed strong \nsanctions on Syria\u2019s leaders. We supported a transfer of \npower that would be responsive to the Syrian people. \nAnd many of our allies have joined in this effort. But \nfor the sake of Syria \u2014 and the peace and security of \nthe world \u2014 we must speak with one voice. There is \nno excuse for inaction. Now is the time for the Security \nCouncil to sanction the Syrian regime and to stand with \nthe Syrian people. \n Throughout the region, we will have to respond \nto the calls for change. In Yemen, men, women and \nchildren gather by the thousands in towns and city \nsquares every day with the hope that their \ndetermination and spilled blood will prevail over a \ncorrupt system. America supports those aspirations. We \nmust work with Yemen\u2019s neighbours and our partners \naround the world to seek a path that allows for a \npeaceful transition of power from President Saleh, and \na movement to free and fair elections as soon as \npossible. \n In Bahrain, steps have been taken towards reform \nand accountability. We are pleased with that, but more \nis required. America is a close friend of Bahrain, and \nwe will continue to call on the Government and the \nmain opposition bloc \u2014 al-Wifaq \u2014 to pursue a \nmeaningful dialogue that brings peaceful change that is \nresponsive to the people. We believe the patriotism that \nbinds Bahrainis together must be more powerful than \nthe sectarian forces that would tear them apart. It will \nbe hard, but it is possible. \n We believe that each nation must chart its own \ncourse to fulfil the aspirations of its people. America \ndoes not expect to agree with every party or person \nwho expresses themselves politically, but we will \nalways stand up for the universal rights that were \nembraced by this Assembly. Those rights depend on \nelections that are free and fair, governance that is \ntransparent and accountable, respect for the rights of \nwomen and minorities, and justice that is equal and \nfair. That is what our people deserve. Those are the \nelements of peace that can last. \n Moreover, the United States will continue to \nsupport, with greater trade and investment, those \nnations that transition to democracy, so that freedom is \nfollowed by opportunity. We will pursue deeper \nengagement with Governments, but also with civil \nsociety \u2014 students and entrepreneurs, political parties \nand the press. We have banned those who abuse human \nrights from travelling to our country and we have \nsanctioned those who trample on human rights abroad. \nAnd we will always serve as a voice for those who \nhave been silenced. \n Now, I know, particularly this week, that for \nmany in this Hall, there is one issue that stands as a test \nof these principles and a test of American foreign \npolicy, and that is the conflict between the Israelis and \nthe Palestinians. \n One year ago, I stood at this podium and I called \nfor an independent Palestine. I believed then, and I \nbelieve now, that the Palestinian people deserve a State \nof their own, but what I also said is that a genuine \npeace can be realized only between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians themselves. One year later, despite \nextensive efforts by America and others, the parties \nhave not bridged their differences. Faced with this \nstalemate, I put forward a new basis for negotiations in \nMay of this year. That basis is clear. It is well known to \nall of us here. Israelis must know that any agreement \nprovides assurances for their security. Palestinians \ndeserve to know the territorial basis of their State. \n I know that many are frustrated by the lack of \nprogress; I assure them that I am too. But the question \nis not the goal that we seek. The question is: How do \nwe reach that goal? And I am convinced that there is no \nshortcut to the end of a conflict that has endured for \ndecades. Peace is hard work. Peace will not come \nthrough statements and resolutions at the United \nNations. If it were that easy, it would have been \naccomplished by now. Ultimately, it is the Israelis and \nthe Palestinians who must live side by side. Ultimately, \nit is the Israelis and the Palestinians \u2014 not us \u2014 who \nmust reach agreement on the issues that divide them: \non borders and on security, on refugees and on \nJerusalem. \n Ultimately, peace depends upon compromise \namong people who must live together long after our \nspeeches are over, long after our votes have been \ntallied. That is the lesson of Northern Ireland, where \nancient antagonists bridged their differences. That is \nthe lesson of the Sudan, where a negotiated settlement \nled to an independent State. And that is and will be the \n \n \n13 11-50692 \n \npath to a Palestinian State \u2014 negotiations between the \nparties. \n We seek a future where Palestinians live in a \nsovereign State of their own, with no limit to what they \ncan achieve. There is no question that the Palestinians \nhave seen that vision delayed for too long. It is \nprecisely because we believe so strongly in the \naspirations of the Palestinian people that America has \ninvested so much time and so much effort in the \nbuilding of a Palestinian State and in the negotiations \nthat can deliver a Palestinian State. \n But understand this as well: America\u2019s \ncommitment to Israel\u2019s security is unshakeable. Our \nfriendship with Israel is deep and enduring. And so we \nbelieve that any lasting peace must acknowledge the \nvery real security concerns that Israel faces every \nsingle day. \n Let us be honest with ourselves: Israel is \nsurrounded by neighbours that have waged repeated \nwars against it. Israel\u2019s citizens have been killed by \nrockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their \nbuses. Israel\u2019s children come of age knowing that \nthroughout the region other children are taught to hate \nthem. Israel, a small country of less than 8 million \npeople, looks out at a world where leaders of much \nlarger nations threaten to wipe it off of the map. The \nJewish people carry the burden of centuries of exile \nand persecution and fresh memories of knowing that \n6 million people were killed simply because of who \nthey are. Those are facts. They cannot be denied. \n The Jewish people have forged a successful State \nin their historic homeland. Israel deserves recognition. \nIt deserves normal relations with its neighbours. And \nfriends of the Palestinians do them no favours by \nignoring that truth, just as friends of Israel must \nrecognize the need to pursue a two-State solution with \na secure Israel next to an independent Palestine. \n That is the truth. Each side has legitimate \naspirations, and that is part of what makes peace so \nhard. And the deadlock will be broken only when each \nside learns to stand in the other\u2019s shoes and each side \ncan see the world through the other\u2019s eyes. That is \nwhat we should be encouraging. That is what we \nshould be promoting. \n This body \u2014 founded as it was out of the ashes \nof war and genocide, and dedicated as it is to the \ndignity of every single person \u2014 must recognize the \nreality that is lived by the Palestinians and the Israelis \nalike. The measure of our actions must always be \nwhether they advance the right of Israeli and \nPalestinian children to live lives of peace and security \nand dignity and opportunity. And we will succeed in \nthat effort only if we can encourage the parties to sit \ndown, to listen to each other and to understand each \nother\u2019s hopes and each other\u2019s fears. That is the project \nto which America is committed. There are no shortcuts. \nAnd that is what the United Nations should be focused \non in the weeks and months to come. \n Even as we confront these challenges of conflict \nand revolution, we must also recognize \u2014 and we must \nalso remind ourselves \u2014 that peace is not just the \nabsence of war. True peace depends on creating the \nopportunity that makes life worth living. And to do \nthat, we must confront the common enemies of \nhumanity: nuclear weapons and poverty, ignorance and \ndisease. Those forces corrode the possibility of lasting \npeace and together we are called upon to confront \nthem. \n To lift the spectre of mass destruction, we must \ncome together to pursue the peace and security of a \nworld without nuclear weapons. Over the past two \nyears, we have begun to walk down that path. Since \nour Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., \nnearly 50 nations have taken steps to secure nuclear \nmaterials from terrorists and smugglers. Next March, a \nsummit in Seoul will advance our efforts to lock down \nall of them. The New START Treaty between the \nUnited States and Russia will cut our deployed arsenals \nto the lowest level in half a century, and our nations are \npursuing talks on how to achieve even deeper \nreductions. America will continue to work for a ban on \nthe testing of nuclear weapons and the production of \nfissile material needed to make them. \n And so we have begun to move in the right \ndirection. And the United States is committed to \nmeeting our obligations. But even as we meet our \nobligations, we have strengthened the treaties and \ninstitutions that help stop the spread of those weapons. \nAnd to do so, we must continue to hold accountable \nthose nations that flout them. \n The Iranian Government cannot demonstrate that \nits programme is peaceful. It has not met its obligations \nand it rejects offers that would provide it with peaceful \nnuclear power. North Korea has yet to take concrete \nsteps towards abandoning its weapons and continues \n  \n \n11-50692 14 \n \nbelligerent action against the South. There is a future \nof greater opportunity for the people of those nations if \ntheir Governments meet their international obligations. \nBut if they continue down a path that is outside \ninternational law, they must be met with greater \npressure and isolation. That is what our commitment to \npeace and security demands. \n To bring prosperity to our people, we must \npromote the growth that creates opportunity. In this \neffort, let us not forget that we have made enormous \nprogress over the past several decades. Closed societies \ngave way to open markets. Innovation and \nentrepreneurship have transformed the way we live and \nthe things that we do. Emerging economies from Asia \nto the Americas have lifted hundreds of millions of \npeople from poverty. It is an extraordinary \nachievement.  \n And yet, three years ago, we were confronted \nwith the worst financial crisis in eight decades. And \nthat crisis proved a fact that has become clearer with \neach passing year. Our fates are interconnected. In a \nglobal economy, nations will rise or fall together. \n Today, we confront the challenges that have \nfollowed on the heels of that crisis. Around the world \nrecovery is still fragile. Markets remain volatile. Too \nmany people are out of work. Too many others are \nstruggling just to get by. We acted together to avert a \ndepression in 2009. We must take urgent and \ncoordinated action once more. \n Here in the United States, I have announced a \nplan to put Americans back to work and jump-start our \neconomy, at the same time as I am committed to \nsubstantially reducing our deficits over time. \n We stand with our European allies as they \nreshape their institutions and address their own fiscal \nchallenges. For other countries, leaders face a different \nchallenge as they shift their economy towards more \nself-reliance, boosting domestic demand while slowing \ninflation. So we will work with emerging economies \nthat have rebounded strongly so that rising standards of \nliving create new markets that promote global growth. \nThat is what our commitment to prosperity demands. \n To combat the poverty that punishes our children, \nwe must act on the belief that freedom from want is a \nbasic human right. The United States has made it a \nfocus of our engagement abroad to help people to feed \nthemselves. And today, as drought and conflict have \nbrought famine to the Horn of Africa, our conscience \ncalls on us to act. Together, we must continue to \nprovide assistance and support organizations that can \nreach those in need. And together, we must insist on \nunrestricted humanitarian access so that we can save \nthe lives of thousands of men and women and children. \nOur common humanity is at stake. Let us show that the \nlife of a child in Somalia is as precious as any other. \nThat is what our commitment to our fellow human \nbeings demands. \n To stop disease that spreads across borders, we \nmust strengthen our system of public health. We will \ncontinue the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \nmalaria. We will focus on the health of mothers and of \nchildren. And we must come together to prevent and \ndetect and fight every kind of biological danger \u2014 \nwhether it is a pandemic like H1N1 or a terrorist threat \nor a treatable disease. \n This week, America signed an agreement with the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) to affirm our \ncommitment to meeting that challenge. And today, I \nurge all nations to join us in meeting the WHO goal of \nmaking sure all nations have core capacities to address \npublic health emergencies in place by 2012. That is \nwhat our commitment to the health of our people \ndemands. \n To preserve our planet, we must not put off action \nthat climate change demands. We have to tap the power \nof science to save those resources that are scarce. And \ntogether, we must continue our work to build on the \nprogress made in Copenhagen and Canc\u00fan, so that all \nthe major economies represented here today follow \nthrough on the commitments that were made. Together, \nwe must work to transform the energy that powers our \neconomies and support others as they move down that \npath. That is what our commitment to the next \ngeneration demands. \n To make sure our societies reach their potential, \nwe must allow our citizens to reach theirs. No country \ncan afford the corruption that plagues the world like a \ncancer. Together, we must harness the power of open \nsocieties and open economies. That is why we have \npartnered with countries across the globe to launch a \nnew partnership on open Government that helps ensure \naccountability and helps to empower citizens. No \ncountry should deny people their rights to freedom of \nspeech and freedom of religion, but also no country \nshould deny people their rights because of whom they \n \n \n15 11-50692 \n \nlove, which is why we must stand up for the rights of \ngays and lesbians everywhere. \n No country can realize its potential if half its \npopulation cannot reach theirs. This week, the United \nStates signed a new declaration on women\u2019s \nparticipation. Next year, we should each announce the \nsteps we are taking to break down the economic and \npolitical barriers that stand in the way of women and \ngirls. That is what our commitment to human progress \ndemands. \n I know there is no straight line to that progress, \nno single path to success. We come from different \ncultures, and carry with us different histories. But let \nus never forget that even as we gather here as Heads of \ndifferent Governments, we represent citizens who share \nthe same basic aspirations to live with dignity and \nfreedom, to get an education and pursue opportunity, to \nlove our families and love and worship our God, to live \nin the kind of peace that makes life worth living. \n It is the nature of our imperfect world that we are \nforced to learn these lessons over and over again. \nConflict and repression will endure so long as some \npeople refuse to do unto others as we would have them \ndo unto us. Yet that is precisely why we have built \ninstitutions like this \u2014 to bind our fates together, to \nhelp us recognize ourselves in each other \u2014 because \nthose who came before us believed that peace is \npreferable to war, and freedom is preferable to \nsuppression, and prosperity is preferable to poverty. \nThat is the message that comes not from capitals, but \nfrom citizens, from our people. \n When the cornerstone of this very building was \nput in place, President Truman came here to New York \nand said, \u201cThe United Nations is essentially an \nexpression of the moral nature of man\u2019s aspirations\u201d \u2014 \nthe moral nature of man\u2019s aspirations. As we live in a \nworld that is changing at a breathtaking pace, that is a \nlesson that we must never forget. \n Peace is hard, but we know that it is possible. So, \ntogether, let us be resolved to see that it is defined by \nour hopes and not by our fears. Together, let us make \npeace \u2014 but a peace, most importantly, that will last."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government \nand the people of South Africa, I wish to extend our \nsincere congratulations to Ambassador Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly. We wish him a successful tenure in \nthe stewardship of this body and assure him of our \ndelegation\u2019s full support. We also congratulate his \npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for the diligent manner \nin which he guided the work of the Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session. \n I would further like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his re-appointment as \nSecretary-General. \n It is also an honour for South Africa to welcome \nthe Republic of South Sudan to the community of \nnations as the 193rd State Member of the United \nNations. \n This month, the United States and the world \nmarked the tenth anniversary of the horrendous \nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, which affected \nthe United States and 89 other countries. That horrific \nincident united the international community and \nstrengthened its resolve to cooperate in the fight \nagainst terrorism. We pay our respects to the victims of \nthe tragedy and their families. We reaffirm our \ncommitment to working with other Member States to \neradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. \n The theme of this session \u2014 \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d \u2014 is timely and well chosen. The Charter of \nthe United Nations mandates the Organization to \nutilize mediation as one of the tools to prevent and \nresolve conflicts across the globe. The role of \nmediation as a tool for the settlement of disputes has \nrenewed relevance today, given the number of conflicts \nin the world. We should defend the independence and \nimpartiality of the United Nations and promote the \nprinciples of its Charter during conflicts and crises. \nThe United Nations should never take sides in any \nconflict but should always maintain its impartiality. \nThe United Nations must not allow itself to be used by \nany country, regardless of its history or size. All \ncitizens of the world should feel confident and secure \nin the knowledge that the United Nations is above all \npartisan interests and serves only those of the citizens \nof the globe. \n We are of the view that regional organizations \nplay a crucial role in the resolution of conflicts and in \nregional mediation processes. The Charter of the \nUnited Nations itself provides for the role of regional \norganizations in cooperation with the United Nations. \nThis role of the regions must always be enforced and \nenhanced, and not undermined. In our continent, the \nAfrican Union (AU) continues to play a significant role \nin mediation and the resolution of conflicts, trying at \n \n \n23 11-50702 \n \nall times to produce African solutions to African \nproblems, of course with the support of the world. \n This year, the world witnessed the so-called Arab \nSpring in North Africa and the Middle East. With \nregard to the situation in Libya, the AU played a \ncrucial role in seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis, \nin line with its mandate of working for peace and \nstability in the continent. However, it is a matter of \nrecord now that the AU efforts were never given a \nchance. Military actions were preferred over peaceful \nmeans. \n Nonetheless, the AU continues to be seized with \nthe Libyan conflict, as it should be. South Africa, \nthrough the AU and the United Nations, will work with \nthe National Transitional Council, the representative of \nthe Libyan people, as it proceeds to form an inclusive \ntransitional Government that will take the Libyan seat \nin the African Union. During this period of working \ntowards normalcy in Libya, we call for a cessation of \nhostilities and an end to the NATO aerial \nbombardment. We also call for the lifting of the no-fly \nzone, whose imposition was necessary for the \nprotection of civilians. \n The proliferation of arms in Libya is a major \nconcern. The transitional Government will need to be \nsupported in addressing this security issue. It may pose \na serious challenge affecting the entire subregion if it is \nnot adequately attended to. We also urge the new \nLibyan authorities to ensure the protection of migrant \nworkers, especially those from sub-Saharan African \ncountries, who number approximately 2.5 million. \nImmediate measures should be taken to put an end to \nthe killing, arbitrary arrest and detention of migrant \nworkers and black Libyans. \n We will fully support the people of Libya as they \ngo through the transition towards a new, united and \ndemocratic Libya that protects human rights, human \ndignity and freedom. \n South Africa continues to support international \nefforts to assist the people of Palestine and Israel to \nfind lasting peace. The decades-old struggle of the \nPalestinian people for a sovereign State of their own \nhas now reached a turning point. The Palestinian \nAuthority, backed by the League of Arab States, has \nstated its intention to seek United Nations membership \nfor the State of Palestine. South Africa fully supports \nthis position. It is a decisive step towards achieving \nlasting peace, economic cooperation and prosperity for \nthe millions of people in the Middle East, and we urge \nthat it be viewed favourably. \n We also support the ongoing struggle for self-\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara. We \nurge the international community to support their quest \nfor freedom, human rights and dignity. \n We reiterate our call for the lifting of the \neconomic and financial embargo against the people of \nCuba in order to help them gain their economic \nfreedom. \n All Member States have a duty to safeguard the \nfuture and relevance of the United Nations. Recent \ninternational developments have made more urgent our \nefforts to intensify the reform agenda of the United \nNations, particularly the Security Council, as well as \nthe Bretton Woods institutions. No reform can be \ncomplete without the substantive reform of the \nSecurity Council, whose membership must be \nconsistent with the principle of equitable geographical \nrepresentation. In this regard, we reiterate our call for \nAfrica to be represented in the category of permanent \nmembership of the Security Council. \n South Africa is preparing to welcome the \ninternational community and all stakeholders to the \nseventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange and to the seventh Meeting of the Parties to the \nKyoto Protocol, in November and December this year. \nThe success of the Conference is highly dependent on \nthe willingness of all parties to reach an agreement. It \ndoes not depend on South Africa alone. As leaders, we \nare accountable to the global citizenry, the ordinary \npeople that suffer daily from the impacts of climate \nchange. They hold high expectations of their leaders to \nbe responsible and to find effective solutions to the \nthreat that climate change poses to their livelihood, \nquality of life, dignity and, in many cases, their very \nsurvival. We dare not fail them. \n We are witnessing the catastrophic effects of \nfamine in Somalia and neighbouring countries. Our \nresponse should not be left to the United Nations alone; \nit requires united action from all of us. South Africa \nhas been humbled to contribute in a small way to the \nalleviation of human suffering. The people of Somalia \nstill need more support, and we urge the world to focus \nits attention more sharply on Somalia and its \nneighbours in the Horn of Africa. \n  \n \n11-50702 24 \n \n It is commendable that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and their realization by 2015 \ncontinue to feature on the agenda of the General \nAssembly. We now have four years to go before we \nreach the target date. It is clear that many of the Goals \nwill not be attained on time, particularly in \nsub-Saharan Africa. We call on the international \ncommunity and the United Nations to redouble efforts \nto assist countries that are lagging. \n At this session, we will be commemorating the \ntenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban \nDeclaration and Programme of Action \u2014 the outcome \ndocument of the World Conference against Racism, \nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related \nIntolerance, which was held in Durban in 2001. Racism \nand racial discrimination continue to pose a challenge \nto humankind and to negate the principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations. We should continue to \nwork together to eradicate the scourge of racism. \n On 8 January 2012, the African National \nCongress (ANC), the oldest liberation movement in \nAfrica, will mark 100 years of existence since its \nestablishment in 1912. The ANC spearheaded the \nstruggle against racial oppression, colonialism and \napartheid in South Africa. It inspired many in the \nAfrican continent to fight for their freedom and \nindependence from colonialism. \n The United Nations declared apartheid a crime \nagainst humanity and in that way endorsed the struggle \nagainst racial oppression in our country. The centenary \nof the ANC recognizes the immense contribution of the \nUnited Nations and the international community in \nworking to eradicate racism and racial discrimination \nin the world. We will, tomorrow, host a symposium on \nSouth Africa\u2019s contribution to the fight against racism \nand racial discrimination. \n Working together, let us remain committed to \nmultilateralism and cooperation in this session of the \nGeneral Assembly and beyond, and promote the \nrealization of a more equitable and just world."

        "file_text": "It gives me \ngreat pleasure to address the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations this year, at a time when its President is \na son of the State of Qatar, His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser. I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate him on his election and to wish him every \nsuccess in his mission. I would also like to express my \nthanks to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph \nDeiss, for his hard work during his presidency of the \nprevious session. Let me also congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for the trust that all \nMember States expressed in him by reappointing him \nas Secretary-General of the United Nations for a \nsecond term. \n I come to the Assembly from a region brimming \nwith great expectations and hopes that is navigating \nthrough strong currents, a region whose peoples are \ncalling for reform so that they can achieve their goals, \nassume their responsibilities and take their place in the \npartnership of the future of humankind, with all of its \nchallenges and prospects. \n We have been aware of our role from the very \nbeginning and we have acted within its parameters. We \nare for the promotion of dialogue among cultures and \ncivilizations. We are for strengthening and consolidating \nrelations among peoples. We are for the consolidation \nof rapprochement among Powers on the basis of the \nprinciples of right and justice and within the \nframework of rightful cooperation. That cooperation \nmust be governed by the principles, laws and \n  \n \n11-50692 16 \n \ninternational charters and covenants that have been \ndeveloped by humankind over the centuries to ensure a \nbetter future for the world. \n All members of the Assembly are aware that the \nblossoming of the Arab Spring \u2014 with all that it \nrepresents in Arab and human history \u2014 has presented \neveryone with heavy responsibilities that they have to \nassume, as well as positions that they have to take. We \nwere among those who made a choice. On the one \nhand, we have always had a clear policy with regard to \nthe rules that govern our Arab, regional and \ninternational relations. Those rules are based on \nunderstanding, reconciliation and harmony among \npeoples and nations. On the other hand, like others, we \nhave been unable to turn a deaf ear or a blind eye to the \ncalls of the wounded seeking help from near and far \nagainst an entrenched oppression and injustice. \n For our part, we exhausted each and every means, \nuntil the only option left for us was to hear and \nsympathize, and to watch and help. We knew that this \nwas not a solution, but rather an emergency situation in \nthe context of one of the most critical issues in the \nArab world today, by which I mean the issue of \nchange. \n We know that our principled choices are stable \nand strong. We also know that our subsequent response \nto the prevailing situation stems from urgency, and that \nit is a situation that needs to be settled on the basis of \nthe rules and laws that govern international relations in \nthe contemporary world. It is a situation that should \nshift responsibilities from States acting individually to \nan international community acting in accordance with \nits rules and laws. \n We have already expressed our views here, \nduring previous sessions of the Assembly, that the \nUnited Nations system needs to evolve in a manner \nconsistent with the situations that reflect the realities of \na new world. That world is not one linked with \ninterests alone, but one where it is imperative to have \nan agreement that confirms the principles that govern \ncivilized behaviour, while simultaneously preserving \nthe unity of those interests. \n The major problems in the Middle East region are \nthe question of Palestine and the continued Israeli \noccupation of Arab territories in the West Bank, the \nGolan Heights and the Shaba\u2019a farmlands in southern \nLebanon, in addition to the threat of war and the \nstrangulating Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip. \n For over four decades, all peace efforts that have \nbeen deployed have resulted in failures to reach a just \nsettlement that would ensure a lasting and \ncomprehensive peace in the region. This is because of \nIsrael\u2019s intransigent position, which seems to be that its \nmilitary might enable it to guarantee peace and \nsecurity, and its insistence to play for time and to use \nthe negotiations to preserve the status quo by \ncontinuing Jewish settlement. \n Faced with this stalemate in the Palestinian cause, \nthe continued suffering of the Palestinian people under \noccupation and persistent violations of their human and \nnational rights, we urge all Member States of the \nUnited Nations to listen to the voice of right. We urge \nthem to respond to the Palestinians\u2019 legitimate request \nfor a Palestinian State that will become a full-fledged \nmember of the United Nations, on an equal footing \nwith all other Member States. This will pave the way \nfor the realization of peace in our region. "

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his \nelection to preside over the sixty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, and extend the best wishes of the \nPrime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Mrs. Kamla \nPersad-Bissessar, and of the Government and people of \nmy country, on whose behalf I address the Assembly. \n I also welcome South Sudan as the newest \nMember of the United Nations. \n More than six decades ago, the United Nations \nwas established, among other things, to save \nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war, \npromote social progress and better standards of life in \ngreater freedom, and employ international machinery \nfor the promotion of the economic and social \nadvancement of all peoples. \n Notwithstanding instances of conflicts that have \nthreatened to reverse the gains achieved since 1945, the \nUnited Nations, with the support of Member States, has \nachieved some success in maintaining international \npeace and security. An important ingredient fuelling \nthis success has been the promotion by the United \nNations of the principle of the settlement of disputes \nthrough pacific or peaceful means. \n The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is very \nsupportive of the President\u2019s choice of the theme for \nthis debate, \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means\u201d. It provides, in our view, \nan opportunity for members of the international \ncommunity to reaffirm their commitment to this \nimportant principle, which is not only enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations but also widely accepted \nas forming part of customary international law.  \n The Charter is the primary legal instrument \ngoverning the conduct of international relations among \nStates. Indeed, Article 33 imposes a binding legal \nobligation on parties to disputes to settle them first of \nall through peaceful means. Under Chapter VII, the \nSecurity Council is also required, as a first resort, to \nuse peaceful means to resolve disputes that constitute \nthreats to peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of \naggression. \n We meet at a time when peoples everywhere are \nseeking more direct roles in the governance of their \nsocieties; when they are not prepared to be silent \nspectators to their plight; when ordinary, law-abiding \ncitizens are prepared to die for the cause of freedom \nfrom tyranny and for democracy; when leadership that \nis anything less than democratic is unacceptable; when \nsocial media have united the peoples of the world into \na global community with one aspiration \u2014 the dignity \nof the human person; and when the hunger of the souls \nof peoples of many nations for democracy cannot be \nappeased by false promises of a distant utopia. Above \nall, we are witnessing levels of youth alienation and \nrestlessness that challenge leaders to bridge the gap \nbetween old cultures and traditions of governance with \n  \n \n11-51398 18 \n \nnew aspirations. There will be no future that is \npeaceful unless the cynicism of the young is addressed. \n Developments in the Middle East and in North \nAfrica reveal a global growing dissonance among the \nmasses with regimes that trample on the freedoms \nfundamental to democracy and do not allow for \nparticipation in governance. In a world linked by social \nmedia, the risk of a people\u2019s uprising that transcends \ncontinents and borders is real. It is a kind of social \nchaos that as leaders we must all prevent. If we do not, \nthe gains we have made will be lost and a kind of \nanarchy could be set in motion. \n What are the reasons for all of this? They have to \ndo with the perception of a denial that people feel \nexists today. That denial is political in nature in terms \nof shared governance; it is also material in nature, as it \nrelates to the way people feel about how resources are \nallocated in their countries; it is also spiritual in nature, \nbecause of the general emptiness that people feel when \nit comes to realizing their human potential.  \n Politically, the age of totalitarianism and \nanti-democratic leadership styles is over. When it \ncomes to the use of their countries\u2019 material resources, \npeople wish to see more equitable distribution and \napplication in ways that improve basic standards of \nliving. The ability to eat even a single meal or to \nreceive basic health care, education, affordable public \ntransport and housing is today at the top of the list of \npeople\u2019s priorities. As leaders of the world, we must \nstop and we must answer. Now more than ever, the \nworld must allocate its resources equitably, ethically, \nsustainably and transparently. \n While we at the United Nations generally talk \nabout mediation as settling differences among nations, \nperhaps the real mediation has to be between \ngenerations. Leaders must now adopt styles of \nleadership that embrace active listening to the views of \nthose governed. Leaders must develop approaches that \nbuild consensus and promote participation, since \npeople now demand a greater say in how their futures \nare shaped. They want to author that future, not be \ndictated to. They want to arrive at a destiny that they \nhave shaped, not one that is shaped for them.  \n The defeat of economic and social demons will \ncome about only when there is unity of purpose, \nnationally and globally \u2014 a reality that is possible only \nwhen the energies of all stakeholders are harnessed \naround a common vision. A common vision cannot be \nfostered when conflicts, internal or external, are \nallowed to fester. This results in the further alienation \nof people who often resort to violence and socially \ndisruptive behaviour to solve disputes. \n Trinidad and Tobago has always advocated the \nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means. This is based \non our support for an international order founded on \nrespect for the rule of law. In this regard, we hold \nsacred the territorial sovereignty of States and the \ninalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms of \nindividuals. We also view the promotion of justice as \nindispensable to the maintenance of peace and security \nat the national, regional and global levels. \nNevertheless, none of these objectives would be \nattainable if there were no systems encouraging \nMember States to settle disputes peacefully. That is \nwhy we have always been vociferous in our support of \nthe work of the International Criminal Court and other \ntribunals established to promote peace by dispensing \njustice. \n Trinidad and Tobago relies heavily for its \neconomic development on the exploration and \nexploitation of the living and mineral resources of the \nmaritime zones within our national jurisdiction. In \ndoing this, we have had to delimit our maritime \nboundaries with neighbouring coastal States in \naccordance with the relevant provisions of the 1982 \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and \nother applicable rules of international law. I can assure \nthe Assembly that this has been done by peaceful \nmeans, either through diplomatic negotiations or by \narbitration pursuant to the provisions of annex VII of \nthe Convention. \n Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the importance \nof the need to settle disputes by peaceful means. \nConsequently, we have become parties to several \nconventions for settling commercial and investment \ndisputes. These have been given the force of law in our \njurisdiction. For example, our 1996 Foreign Arbitral \nAwards Act gives effect to Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s \nobligations under the 1958 Convention on the \nRecognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral \nAwards. Additionally, as a State party to the \nConvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes \nbetween States and Nationals of Other States, we also \nrecognize that, like States, foreign nationals who invest \nin Trinidad and Tobago must be in a position to avail \nthemselves of the conciliation and arbitration services \nprovided by the International Centre for Settlement of \n \n \n19 11-51398 \n \nInvestment Disputes, which is an impartial \ninternational forum for resolving potential investment \ndisputes. Such treaties not only provide the requisite \nreassurance for investors, who know that any dispute \nthat may arise will be settled through an objective \nprocess; they also serve as incentives for would-be \ninvestors to do business in Trinidad and Tobago. \n We in Trinidad and Tobago support the position \ntaken by the International Court of Justice and the \nInternational Law Commission that all Member States \nare bound to refrain in their international relations \nfrom the threat or use of force against the territorial \nintegrity or political independence of any State, or in \nany other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the \nUnited Nations. It is for these reasons that we have \nalways upheld the position that border disputes in our \nregion or any part of the globe should he settled \npeacefully. It will be recalled that as far back as 1970, \nTrinidad and Tobago, through the good offices of our \nformer Prime Minister, the late Mr. Eric Williams, \nfacilitated the conclusion of the Protocol of Port-of-\nSpain, whereby Guyana and Venezuela agreed to a \n12-year moratorium on their border dispute. \n Since then, Trinidad and Tobago has supported \nother initiatives mounted by the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM), the Organization of American States and \nthe United Nations aimed at resolving this dispute by \npeaceful means. Elsewhere in our region, we have \nencouraged the use of good offices and mediation to \nresolve the border dispute between Belize and Guyana, \nas well as internal disputes in Haiti. Our support for \nthese regional initiatives is in keeping with the \nprovisions of Article 52 of the Charter, which envisions \na role for regional organizations in the pacific \nsettlement of disputes. \n Further afield, we have always advocated that the \nMiddle East conflict should be settled peacefully. \nTrinidad and Tobago supports the quest of Palestinians \nfor a State of their own with secure borders, alongside \nthe State of Israel, whose borders must also be secure \nand free from terrorist attacks. The United Nations \nmust continue to show leadership and work with the \nArab League and other entities to resolve the decades-\nold conflict between Israel and Palestine so that there \ncan be lasting peace in the region. For far too long, we, \nlike the rest of the world, have witnessed the \nhorrendous loss of life and destruction of infrastructure \nwhich have erased the hopes and prospects of many \nyoung people for a bright future in the place of their \nbirth. \n The efforts of States at the national or regional \nlevels for the settlement of disputes emphasize their \nprimary responsibility under the Charter to settle \ndisputes peacefully. These are supplementary to and \nreinforce the role of the United Nations as mandated \nunder the Charter. Trinidad and Tobago therefore \nwelcomes the renewed emphasis placed by the United \nNations on mediation and other means for the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, as demonstrated in the report of \nthe Secretary-General dated 8 April 2009 (S/2009/189), \nas well as the adoption on 22 June 2011 by the General \nAssembly of its resolution 65/283, entitled \n\u201cStrengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \nresolution\u201d. \n During her contribution to the general debate last \nyear (see A/65/PV.20), The Honourable Prime Minister \nof Trinidad and Tobago, Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, \ntook the political initiative to call on the General \nAssembly to adopt a resolution on women, \ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control. That \nresolution, which was eventually adopted by the \nAssembly as resolution 65/69, calls on States to \npromote the equitable representation of women in all \ndecision-making processes with regard to matters \nrelated to disarmament, non-proliferation and arms \ncontrol. \n One year later, the United Nations continues to \nmake strides in placing women at the centre of all of its \nactivities. This has been reflected, for example, in the \nestablishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender \nEquality and the Empowerment of Women \n(UN-Women). Consistent with this action, Trinidad and \nTobago applauds the decision taken by Member States \nin resolution 65/283, which recognizes the importance \nof the full and effective participation of women at all \nlevels, at all stages and in all aspects of the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \nresolution, as well as the need to address the lack of \nwomen as chief or lead peace mediators. \n Women are among the most vulnerable during \nconflicts, internal or otherwise, and hence must be \ninvolved in all vehicles relating to the settlement of \ndisputes and conflict prevention. The absence of \nwomen in the process could result in the development \nof peace agreements which are not comprehensive in \n  \n \n11-51398 20 \n \nscope and which may not address those issues that \naffect women during periods of conflict and which \ncontinue thereafter. \n The inclusion of women in the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention is related \nto their involvement in the political process. Women, in \nwhatever part of the world, must not be left out of the \npolitical decision-making process. The Honourable \nPrime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago continues to \ndemonstrate her commitment to the participation of \nwomen in Government in meaningful ways, both \nnationally and internationally. Her advocacy with \nrespect to this issue resulted in the hosting in Trinidad \nand Tobago in 2011 of regional seminars to promote \nthis democratic and just cause.  \n Bearing in mind the significance of this subject, \nPrime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, together with \nother States, the United Nations Development \nProgramme and UN-Women, successfully co-hosted a \nhigh-level colloquium on women\u2019s political \nparticipation last Monday in the margins of the General \nAssembly. It was gratifying and fulfilling to see a room \noverflowing with women from all over the world \nchampioning the common cause of gender equality. \nThe event clearly demonstrated that the small size of a \ncountry is not a deterrent to the realization of big \ndreams and the fulfilment of wholesome ideals in the \npursuit of human development.  \n As part of the colloquium, the Prime Minister of \nTrinidad and Tobago was among those leaders who \nsigned a declaration on advancing women\u2019s political \nparticipation. It is the hope of Trinidad and Tobago that \nthe outcome of this event will promote greater global \nconsciousness and discussions on the participation of \nwomen in Government and the advancement of \ndemocracy globally. In keeping with the objective of \nthis meeting, Trinidad and Tobago calls on Member \nStates to implement the provisions of resolution 65/283 \non the inclusion of women as mediators in the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention. At the \nsame time, we would also welcome greater efforts to \nrecruit lead mediators from developing countries and \nfrom small countries, particularly small island \ndeveloping States, including in the Caribbean, \nconsistent with the principle of equitable geographic \ndistribution in the recruitment of United Nations \npersonnel. \n Like women, our young people are also very \nsusceptible to the negative effects of strife and \ntherefore they, too, must be protected. A number of \ncases before the International Criminal Court (ICC) \nshow that the perpetrators are on trial or under \ninvestigation for committing war crimes because they \nconscripted or enlisted children under the age of 15 \ninto their national armed forces or used them to \nparticipate actively in hostilities. In addition to \nmechanisms aimed at bringing the accused to justice, \nwe support all those aimed at rehabilitating young \npeople who have survived conflict so that they can \nadvance, reach their fullest potential and contribute to \nthe development of their societies. This can be \nachieved if they are able to enjoy their basic human \nrights. Thus we call on States that are in a position to \ndo so to contribute to UNICEF, the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross and the ICC Trust Fund \nfor Victims, which assist in the rehabilitation of \nchildren and other victims of armed conflict. \n Trinidad and Tobago endorses a number of other \nelements contained in resolution 65/283 relating to the \nstrengthening of the position of the United Nations in \nassisting States to develop their capacity to employ \nmediation and other peaceful means to resolve \ndisputes. While the adoption of the resolution is \nlaudable, it is only a means to an end. Member States \nmust ensure that all aspects of the resolution are \nimplemented fully. In this regard, Trinidad and Tobago \nwishes to underscore the importance of the provision \nof adequate resources to the Department of Political \nAffairs and its Mediation Support Unit. Without the \nrequired resources, the Secretary-General will not be \nable to effectively use his good offices and other \nmediation capacities to help resolve existing and future \ndisputes. \n The escalation of armed conflict and armed \nviolence is fuelled by several factors. One component \nis the illegal proliferation of conventional arms, \nincluding small arms and light weapons which have \nbeen diverted from the legal market to the illicit trade. \nThe United Nations, in keeping with its obligations \nunder the Charter to promote and maintain \ninternational peace and security, has recognized the \nimpact of the illegal trade in conventional arms on the \npeace and security of countries and regions and has \nadopted several resolutions and implemented different \nprogrammes to address this matter. \n \n \n21 11-51398 \n \n But for us in Trinidad and Tobago and the \nCARICOM region, the most ambitious measure \nundertaken so far is the decision to convene a \nconference in July 2012 to negotiate the text of an arms \ntrade treaty. Trinidad and Tobago and its CARICOM \npartners have been very active in the deliberations of \nmeetings of the Preparatory Committee examining \npossible elements for inclusion in the treaty. As we \napproach the 2012 conference and begin to reflect on \nitems to be included in the agreement, considerable \ncare must also be taken to ensure that there are \nadequate provisions for the settlement of disputes \nwhich may arise among future States parties on the \ninterpretation and application of the provisions of the \narms trade treaty. \n The absence of peaceful means to resolve \nconflicts has led to genocide, war crimes and other \npernicious misdeeds of concern to the international \ncommunity. In many cases, they have stymied \neconomic growth and social progress and have \ndestroyed human lives. They have limited the capacity \nof many States in conflict, especially those in the \ndeveloping world, to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We must save current and future \ngenerations from the plague of war brought about by \nintolerance, xenophobia, border disputes and \ndisagreements over the allocation of resources. We in \nTrinidad and Tobago feel that a concrete way of doing \nthis \u2014 an intervention strategy \u2014 is to focus, as my \ncountry is focusing, on universal preschool education, \nbecause we believe that the human values that are \ninculcated in children from birth until ages 5 or 6 help \nthem to appreciate the value of peace and the value of \ninterpersonal peace. \n Additionally, the United Nations and other \nintergovernmental organizations must address the \nimpatience and restlessness of today\u2019s young people, \nwho are fed up with the misallocation of resources and \nthe lack of both transparency and peoples\u2019 involvement \nin the processes of governance. Their desires to \nreshape the world to reflect greater participation, \nempathy and democratic principles ought not be \nignored by leaders. We are convinced that those \naspirations will be achieved if mediation and other \npeaceful means of solving disputes, among other \nstrategies, are adopted \u2014 and not just among nations, \nbut among individuals and internally within countries.  \n Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to \nworking with regional partners, the United Nations and \nother actors to promote global peace. We must \nstrengthen our capacity to use mediation, \ncomplemented by the introduction of new approaches \nto Government and governance, such as the greater \nparticipation of women and a desire to build consensus. \n We believe that unless leaders listen more, unless \nwe employ mediation to resolve disputes, unless we \nincorporate our disenfranchised women in governance, \nunless we listen to the real message of today about \ngreater participation in governance, and unless we \nrealize that humankind has common challenges as it \naddresses issues like climate change, then the world \nwill have missed a golden opportunity to advance the \ncause of humankind and promote global peace. \n Let us therefore endeavour to resolve our \ncommon global challenges, for to do otherwise would \nbe to fail succeeding generations of humankind, for \nwhich we who meet here today will never be forgiven \nnor forgotten."

        "file_text": "It is with infinite \npleasure, Mr. President, that I join other speakers who \npreceded me in expressing our felicitations to you on \nyour election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. We owe an \nimmense debt of gratitude to your great country, the \nState of Qatar, for making you available to the service \nof the international community. We are confident that \nunder your guidance and leadership the sixty-sixth \nsession will achieve a successful outcome, one which \nwill make a difference to the lives of multitudes of \ndisadvantaged people around the world. May I also pay \ntribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph \nDeiss, whose effective and exemplary stewardship of \nthe sixty-fifth session earned our deep respect and \nadmiration. \n As the world\u2019s problems have in recent decades \nincreased in numbers and complexity, so have the \nchallenges and responsibilities of the United Nations \nSecretary-General, the head of our grand institution. I \nam pleased to note that the Secretary-General, His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, has acquitted himself \nextremely well, at times under very difficult \ncircumstances. We specifically wish to commend him \nfor his concerted efforts in raising the alarm on conflict \nsituations and emerging threats to international peace \nand security. Allow me therefore to seize this \nopportunity to sincerely congratulate Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon on his well-deserved reappointment for a \nsecond term. \n My delegation is of the conviction that all \nproblems and challenges confronting humanity can be \nresolved within the letter and spirit of the United \nNations Charter and international law. In that \nconnection, we must each do our part and work \ntogether to improve the lives of our people by \nconquering hunger, disease and illiteracy, to encourage \nrespect for human rights and freedoms and to respond \nto natural disasters and different humanitarian \nsituations. \n Once again this year, the world has experienced a \nnumber of natural and man-made disasters, including \nviolent, senseless attacks that have claimed numerous \nlives, left many homeless, caused massive destruction \nof property and caused intolerable pain and suffering. \n  \n \n11-51384 2 \n \nMy delegation wishes to express our heartfelt \ncondolences to all those countries that have been \nvictims of those tragedies. \n Our profound sympathies and heartfelt \ncondolences go to the Government and people of Japan \nfor the unfortunate Fukushima incident, triggered by a \nmassive earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck \nthat country early this year. We also wish to convey our \ncondolences and sympathies to the Government and \npeople of Norway on the recent senseless and \nhorrifying attack that left many people dead. \n The humanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa \nequally deserves our attention. We commend the \nUnited Nations for calling the attention of the \ninternational community to the plight of the victims of \nthat disaster. We in Botswana have made our modest \ncontribution to that relief effort. We express our sincere \nappreciation to the United Nations system and the \ninternational community as a whole for their generous \nand timely response to those tragedies. \n At the inception of the United Nations, the \ninternational community pledged a solemn \ndetermination to safeguard succeeding generations \nfrom the scourge of war. In the intervening period, the \nworld has seen monumental changes with profound \neffects on humanity. The end of colonialism and the \ncold war, the defeat of the inhuman system of \napartheid, the institutionalization of conflict prevention \nand resolution mechanisms around the world, as well \nas the strengthening of collaboration between the \nUnited Nations and regional organizations in dealing \nwith conflict situations, come to mind in this regard. \n For decades the people of South Sudan have been \nengulfed in a seemingly endless bloody conflagration, \naccompanied by heavy loss of human life, destruction \nof property and condemnation to untold misery and \nsuffering. However, we are delighted that the people of \nSouth Sudan, with the assistance and support of the \ninternational community, have realized their long-\ncherished dream. They now face a new dawn of \nfreedom and nationhood. Allow me, therefore, to pay a \nfitting tribute to South Sudan on the assumption of her \nrightful place in the comity of nations as a sovereign \nand independent State and the 193rd Member of the \nUnited Nations. \n South Sudan will obviously need the full support \nof the international community in addressing the \nplethora of challenges of nationhood, including \noutstanding issues from the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement such as the future of the Abyei region, and \nother separation issues that could easily undermine this \nfragile transition. Botswana will endeavour, within the \nlimit of her resources, to assist our brothers and sisters \nin South Sudan translate their political freedom into \ntangible social and economic benefits. \n The evolving situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is also a \ncause for optimism. While many security concerns \nremain, we believe President Ouattara and his \nGovernment have put in place the necessary measures \nto consolidate peace, build confidence, promote \nnational reconciliation and set the country on the path \nto normalcy, reconstruction and sustainable \ndevelopment. We urge the international community to \nremain actively engaged in supporting this process. \n While notable strides have been made towards \nresolving some conflicts, regrettably the same cannot \nbe said of many other conflict situations, such as those \nin the Middle East, Somalia and Syria, where peace \nremains elusive, with attendant hardship and misery. \n On Somalia, my delegation takes note of the \nconclusion of the recent Kampala Accord between the \nPresident of the Federal Transitional Government and \nthe Speaker of Parliament, which is a welcome move \ntowards improving the political situation in that \ncountry. However, we remain concerned about the \ndeteriorating security situation and the growing \nhumanitarian crisis in that country, and we call on all \nparties to remain engaged and to fully honour their \nobligations under that Accord. \n Regarding the Middle East, Botswana shares the \ngeneral frustration at the prolonged impasse in the \nsituation in that region. We call on both the \nPalestinians and Israelis to remain engaged in the \nnegotiations on the basis of a two-State solution, in \nwhich the two peoples will live side by side in peace \nand harmony. \n There are other emerging threats to international \npeace and security. My delegation is deeply concerned \nabout States that continue to violate with impunity \ntheir obligations under their constitutions and \ninternational law to protect their citizens from any \narmed conflict.  \n This very Organization is founded on the premise \nthat Governments have the primary duty and \nresponsibility to do all in their power to safeguard the \n \n \n3 11-51384 \n \nlegitimate aspirations of their people for a better life, \nincluding ensuring their safety and security. It is \ntherefore imperative that Governments provide an \nenvironment conducive to addressing the legitimate \nconcerns and grievances of their people through \ninclusive dialogue and mutual understanding. \n Consequently, it is not acceptable under any \ncircumstances for any State to use military force \nagainst the civilian population \u2014 the very citizens it \nhas sworn to protect. I believe we all agree that this is a \nclear violation of human rights and international law \nand an infringement of our common value system \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. \n Our view is that any leader who sanctions such \nuse of force on his people forfeits the legitimate right \nto be recognized as representing the interests of his \npeople. The international community should therefore \nspare no effort in applying all the necessary measures \nat its disposal to protect civilians from such repressive \nGovernments and to hold them accountable for their \natrocities. In this regard, support for the International \nCriminal Court (ICC) is crucial for realizing the full \nimplementation of the Rome Statute. \n We commend the Security Council for its swift \nand resolute action on Libya under its resolution 1973 \n(2011), which authorized NATO to protect civilians in \nthat country.  \n However, we remain concerned about the delay \nand procrastination on a number of situations in Syria. \nThe Council\u2019s condemnation of human rights \nviolations and the military assault on civilians by Syria \ncame rather too late. It failed to convey a clear and \nunequivocal message of revulsion to the Syrian \nauthorities and to urge them to respect international \nhumanitarian law and human rights. Crimes against \nhumanity have been committed in Syria, and the \nleadership in that country should answer for such \ncrimes through the ICC. \n It is important that the international community \nremain vigilant against any breach of international \npeace and security and also respond in a decisive, \nconsistent and timely manner to any such instances. We \nfind it unacceptable that such countries as mentioned \ncan continue to belong to a community of peace-loving \nnations. \n Botswana recognizes the National Transitional \nCouncil (NTC) in Libya as the interim Administration \nuntil there is an elected Government. We therefore \nwelcome the NTC into the United Nations family to \nrepresent the Libyan people during this session. \n The chosen theme for this session \u2014 the role of \nmediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes \u2014 is \nboth timely and pertinent. It is timely, given the \nmultiplicity of mediation efforts in which the \ninternational community is currently engaged as part of \nan effort to find a peaceful solution to the conflicts \nraging in various parts of the world. It is pertinent in \nthat forging international peace and understanding is \nthe raison d\u2019\u00eatre of this very body. \n In order to maintain momentum in governance, \nmy delegation believes that countries emerging from \nconflict should also commit themselves to the strict \nobservance of human rights and national and \ninternational humanitarian law, as well as of the values \nof accountability and transparency, guided by effective \napplication of the rule of law. In this respect, I wish to \nreiterate my country\u2019s support for all efforts geared \ntowards assisting countries emerging from conflict to \nmake successful transitions to post-conflict \nrehabilitation, reconstruction and economic recovery. \n Allow me now to turn to another critical pillar of \nthe United Nations mandate, namely, sustainable \ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. Now more \nthan ever, our global citizenry is demanding practical \nactions to address the global challenges we face. They \nbelieve \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 that collectively we are \nequipped with enough resources, institutions, policies \nand lessons learned to respond effectively to existing \nand emerging global challenges. They therefore expect \nus to muster the requisite political will to find durable \nsolutions to those challenges.  \n For them, it is no longer acceptable for children \nto die from HIV and AIDS or any other preventable \ndisease just because the Agreement on Trade-Related \nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights hinders access \nto affordable treatment. They do not accept that over \n113 million children have no access to primary \neducation. It is certainly no longer acceptable for \npeople to die from cholera and other waterborne \ndiseases when affordable technology for clean water \nand sanitation exists. Nor is it acceptable for our \npeople to continue to be exposed to the dire \nconsequences of climate change, while we debate \nendlessly instead of concluding a comprehensive, \n  \n \n11-51384 4 \n \nlegally binding climate change regime to curb global \nwarming and its effects.  \n In other words, our people want us to do more \nwith the collective resources that we have at our \ndisposal. \n The residual effects of the financial and economic \ncrisis, coupled with ongoing uncertainties in the global \neconomy and the prevailing high cost of energy and \nfood, have compounded the setbacks experienced in \nthe implementation of internationally agreed goals and \ncommitments, including the Millennium Development \nGoals. We must ensure that sustainable development in \nall its three pillars \u2014 social, economic and \nenvironmental \u2014 remains the key framework for \nattaining a balanced approach towards development in \nour countries. In that context, poverty eradication \nshould remain the centrepiece of all our policies and \nprogrammes.  \n As we prepare for a common global policy on \nsustainable development in Brazil in June of next year, \nwe are increasingly concerned about the negative trend \nthe negotiations are taking. The ongoing climate \nchange negotiations, the failed nineteenth session of \nthe Commission on Sustainable Development and the \nongoing discussions on the 2012 United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development continue to \nexpose deep divisions among our countries. \nUnfortunately, those divisions undermine the \nimplementation of existing commitments and threaten \nprospects for an effective global sustainable \ndevelopment regime. We believe that the Rio+20 \nprocesses present an excellent platform for all Member \nStates, individually and collectively, to muster their \nresolve towards the attainment of sustainable \ndevelopment. \n Similarly, the seventeenth Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, to be held in South Africa later this \nyear, offers the international community yet another \nvaluable opportunity to reverse the harmful effects of \nclimate change on our planet. We must forge a spirit of \ncooperation and partnership, including through South-\nSouth cooperation, public-private partnerships, \nresource mobilization and technology transfer, as well \nas capacity-building, to assist countries such as my \nown to exploit the abundant coal reserves for \nsustainable energy production in a manner less harmful \nto the environment. \n Significant progress was made in that respect last \nSeptember, when we resolved to take effective \nmeasures to further strengthen support for and meet the \nspecial needs of regions and countries struggling to \nachieve economic and social development, including \nmiddle-income countries. Recent experience has shown \nthat even that category of countries, which have made \nsmall gains in poverty reduction, are still vulnerable in \nthe event of further global economic and financial \nupheaval. \n The limitations imposed by our fragile economy \nand the landlocked position of my country, Botswana, \nalso call for the speedy implementation of the Almaty \nProgramme of Action, accompanied by renewed efforts \nto level the playing field in international trade. We \nmust muster the political will to conclude the Doha \nRound of the World Trade Organization trade \nnegotiations as soon as possible. \n We as nations, individually and collectively, face \nthe greatest challenge of our time \u2014 the uplifting of \nhumankind. In fulfilling that mammoth task, our \ngreatest hope lies in our ability as leaders to summon \nour courage and political will to do what is right. \n Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswana\u2019s \ncommitment to working with other Members in our \ncommon endeavour to put our Organization at the \nservice of humanity."

        "file_text": "First of \nall, I would like to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I also want to use \nthis occasion to commend the leadership of Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and to laud the dynamism and \nwisdom he brings to the management of world affairs.  \n From this rostrum, I extend a brotherly welcome \nto our sister nation, South Sudan, which just \nproclaimed its independence on 9 July. We share in \ntheir pride, and we welcome them with great respect as \nthe 193rd Member State of the great family of the \nUnited Nations. On behalf of the Republic of Haiti, I \nsend warm congratulations and our hope that the \ncountry may enjoy peace, happiness and prosperity. I \nhonour the memory of those who died in the struggle \nbefore seeing the dawn of a new day shining in that \npart of the African continent. \n Speaking here today on behalf of Haiti, I join my \nvoice with those of all the Member States that, like us, \nhave known the heavy burden of post-disaster and \npost-conflict circumstances, in saying that even among \nthe weakest and most vulnerable hope lives on. They \ncarry the hope of rebirth, because they know that the \npre-crisis reality is no longer a possibility. They know \nthat change \u2014 change in their mentality and change in \ntheir political, economic and social affairs \u2014 must be \ntheir creed. They cannot afford not to change. In the \ncase of Haiti, it is precisely because an entire people \nwere firmly convinced of the need for change that I \nwas elected with a very clear mandate, namely, that of \nbringing about that change.  \n I am convinced that that leap in awareness that \nresulted from suffering is what will lead to a new \nglobal order. That was the case at the beginning of the \nnineteenth century, when Saint-Domingue broke its \nchains and brought about the birth of Haiti. It was the \ncase in 1945, when countries of good will, including \nHaiti, came together to bring about this body which \nbrings us together this week around noble ideals. It \nalso seems to be the case in the light of the political \nchanges affecting North Africa. \n In a country of the South where the human \ndevelopment index is still of concern, a major disaster \nunfortunately arises, the great question of \nresponsibility comes brutally to the fore again, whether \nthe responsibility be local in terms of governance, or \nwhether the responsibility lies with the global order. \nToday\u2019s world and the United Nations in particular will \nbe more and more called upon, because those post-\ndisaster situations include both situations resulting \nfrom natural disasters and those of a passing nature or \nthose that are simply caused by human folly.  \n When on top of that, in some of those cases, all \nof these factors come together, the response must be \n \n \n21 11-51191 \n \nmore carefully designed, more responsible, more \ncoordinated, bolder and more determined.  \n I strongly believe that, first of all, it is for the \naffected countries to seek and find solutions, because \nany solution that is imposed from the outside, however \ngenerous it might be, will, in the medium term, only \nproduce adverse effects. It is up to the people of the \nSouth to determine how they use their wealth, their raw \nmaterials and their future. In the case of Haiti, I have to \nsay that the international community, through the \nUnited Nations, showed by supporting, six months \nafter the earthquake, presidential elections in a difficult \ncontext, that it understood the urgency. I would like to \nthank it for that. \n But I also strongly believe that it would be \nirresponsible for a country that has been hit by disaster \nto deny itself the assistance, expertise and cooperation \nof sisterly nations, whether they be from the emerging \nSouth or from the North, which is supposedly well-off. \n It is that balance, as I was saying, between \nmature governance and well-conceived international \nassistance that should be sought after and codified, \ngenuinely and without any embellishment. I would cite \nas an example the various peacekeeping and \nstabilization missions of the United Nations in \nnumerous places around the globe, including Haiti.  \n The same situation arises everywhere: a country \ninitially welcomes the missions, but in the medium \nterm, they lose steam. Why? Problems arise because \nthe expectations of the host country are excessive. \nFurthermore, missions cannot operate when they work \nunder inflexible terms of reference. That is to be \nregretted, because nothing would more irresponsible \nand dangerous than to let missions leave before an \neffective national alternative is in place.  \n In the case of Haiti, what would the United \nNations Mission have accomplished if today, suddenly \nand without any warning, it were to be withdrawn? Of \ncourse, I am aware of the fact that unacceptable errors \nhave been committed and have affected the prestige of \nthe Mission, but the trees must not be allowed to hide \nthe forest. I believe that political stabilization goes \nthrough a number of stages. It cannot be based simply \non an intervention force or a more or less neutral \nobserver presence. That would reflect a very simplified \nview of the primary role of the United Nations. \nStabilization is more than that. Thus, the Government \npolicy that I stand for consists of four main pillars: \neducation, employment, environment and the rule of \nlaw.  \n How can we build peace unless there is universal \nand free basic education in a country where there is \nmassive illiteracy? How can we promote sustainable \ndevelopment without high quality education that \npromotes citizen values, ensures gender equality, \nvalues cultural identity and openness to the world, and \nleads to tolerance? \n With respect to jobs, allow me to say that we can \ntalk as much as we like about human dignity and \nhuman rights, and about stabilization and peace, but an \nempty stomach is deaf to words. It is by creating \ndecent jobs that are properly paid and that respect the \nrights of vulnerable categories of people that justice \nbegins. It is by a fair distribution of the income from \nraw materials that we will stop smothering the \ncountries of the South and put an end to the speculation \nthat undermines democracy.  \n On these major themes, nations must come \ntogether and come still closer together. They must be \ncommitted to combating deforestation and climate \nchange. We must also seriously take into account the \nproblem of water. There will be no peace in the world \nas long as the living conditions of countries such as \nmine are so poor that they lead to natural disasters \nbecoming even more tragic, floods even worse, drought \neven more deadly and the rural exodus even more \nwidespread.  \n Stabilization today also means, above all, \nestablishing the rule of law, but the rule of law \nrequires, inter alia, an independent, responsible and \nstrong justice system. It also means the ongoing and \ndifficult but necessary establishment of strong \ninstitutions that are stronger than privilege and group \ninterest.  \n The world will become more beautiful when we \nstop talking about condemning or accusing people. \nHaiti has been witness to that fact. But Haiti can also \nsay that in post-disaster assistance, the disbursement of \nfunds that are not subject to inflexible, complex and \nclumsy red tape are those that are best adapted to \nneeds. Therefore, those procedures, even if they are \nsupported, allow the affected countries to take \nownership of the strategic initiatives concerning their \nfuture. Specifically, in terms of the resources made \navailable to the affected populations, it is also desirable \n  \n \n11-51191 22 \n \nthat pledges be followed up with action and that \nreconstruction projects be actually implemented.  \n In a word, I would say that it would be very sad \nto see the left hand taking back what the right hand had \ngiven. The temptation exists; it is the result of a \ndifficult global economic context. But, once again, \ntruth alone must prevail, because when reconstruction \nis left to wait, the long wait can lead to impatience and \nbring harm. In the case of Haiti, as in other post-\nconflict situations, the United Nations and friendly \nnations should come to our aid to help us to reconstruct \nmore than just a physical space, but reconstruct men \nand women, to whom we must give hope. Beyond \nconcepts and abstractions, this is above all a human \nstory. This is the new order we are here to speak of \ntoday: putting human beings back into the heart of the \ncentral debates of our time. This is the momentum in \nwhich we are caught up and which is shared by billions \nof people in the grip of disasters, forced exoduses, \nconflicts and epidemics.  \n In solidarity with those other victims, the Haitian \npeople wish to send a very clear message from the \nplatform of the United Nations. As long as there are \nmen and women of good will, there will be hope. As \nlong as there are nations united in solidarity, there will \nbe hope. We in Haiti have experienced every \nconceivable kind of catastrophe: every form of man-\nmade disaster and all the natural ones, aggravated by \nthe systematic, irresponsible destruction committed by \nhuman beings. We have known epidemics and hunger, \neven marginalization, but Haiti is now back on its feet, \nready to rebuild and ready for a new start. Nothing is \npredetermined. It is this new Haiti that is open to the \nworld, this new Haiti that is open to new investments \nand collaborations, to reconstruction, dialogue and \npeace. And it is this new Haiti that says thank you to \nall those assembled here."

        "file_text": "It is my honour and pleasure at the outset of \nthis brief statement to welcome and congratulate the \nRepublic of South Sudan upon its accession to \nmembership in the United Nations and for its \nparticipation for the first time in the work of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n I am also happy to warmly congratulate \nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the \npresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \nAllow me to express our full confidence in him as he \nundertakes the exceptional efforts required to \nstrengthen the progress achieved to date in terms of \ninternational peace and security, taking into account \nthe need to preserve the well-being, stability and \nprogress of our world. I pay tribute to the effectiveness \nof Qatari diplomacy and its important role in \nstrengthening international peace and security.  \n I also pay tribute to the valuable efforts made by \nMr. Al-Nasser\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, who \nupheld the principles of dialogue and consultation in \norder to reach the best solutions on international issues. \nI also warmly congratulate Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon on his reappointment to head the \nOrganization and wish him full success. I commend his \npersistent Herculean efforts to resolve many issues, \nincluding strengthening international peace and \nsecurity, achieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), combating climate change and mitigating the \nthreats of famine and endemic disease, as well as all of \nthe challenges that hinder the well-being of humanity. \n The sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly \nis taking place at a sensitive political juncture in our \nregion. The popular uprisings in many Arab countries \nhave led to revolutions calling for democracy, justice, \nfreedom and decent living conditions. My country was \nat the forefront of meeting these demands and \naspirations. Over the past few years, we have \nexperienced radical change in the form of a peaceful \nand flexible transition from a totalitarian regime that \nhad suppressed freedoms and emptied the public \ncoffers to a democratic system and credible institutions \nthat have consolidated the rule of law and guaranteed \nindividual and collective freedoms and the rights of all \nsectors of Mauritanian society, based on justice and the \nrule of law. \n Those measures have included the organization of \nfree, fair and transparent presidential elections that \nwere monitored by international observers and even \nendorsed by their opponents. Our country has also \n  \n \n11-51670 2 \n \nbegun enjoying a sincere political openness at all levels \nof society. A few days ago, we launched a genuine \nnational political dialogue open to all of the country\u2019s \npolitical parties. In addition, media airwaves have been \nfreed and licences issued to 10 radio and television \nstations to begin broadcasting in the near future. \n In the context of good governance, my country \nhas enshrined transparency in its administration and its \nstrengthened and independent judiciary. We have \nachieved remarkable levels of growth through \nambitious programmes to improve our population\u2019s \nstandard of living. These programmes focus first and \nforemost on the most vulnerable sectors of society \u2014 \nlow-income citizens and those living in poor \nneighbourhoods and isolated rural areas \u2014 allowing \nmy country to achieve a stable domestic situation that \nwill in turn foster efforts in our young, effective \ndiplomacy.  \n We are a member of the African Union Peace and \nSecurity Council and chair the Good Offices \nCommission, established to bring together opposition \nparties in Libya and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We are fully \nconvinced that dialogue and mediation are the best \nways to resolve conflict and address crises, as \nindicated in the theme of the general debate of this \nsixty-sixth session. \n Since the election of His Excellency \nMr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz as President, we have \nendeavoured to strengthen our presence within regional \nand international organizations, including the United \nNations and its various specialized bodies, the Arab \nMaghreb Union, the League of Arab States, the African \nUnion, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and \nthe Non-Aligned Movement, to name a few. We have \nalso joined regional African and Caribbean groups to \nshow support for their systems and decisions and as \npart of our strategy to broaden our principled foreign \npolicy. \n In that context, we reiterate our support for \nefforts to reform the United Nations and its various \nbodies, including the Security Council. We ask that \nAfrica be given permanent representation, as it is the \nonly continent that has lacked a permanent seat on the \nSecurity Council since the establishment of the United \nNations. Our continent has 1 billion inhabitants and \nhosts more than two-thirds of United Nations \npeacekeeping operations. We also call for permanent \nrepresentation for the Group of Arab States, whose \npopulation makes up more than 11 per cent of the \nworld\u2019s inhabitants.  \n Consultations on Security Council reform have \nbeen ongoing for many years, and we call for \ncontinued consultations in order to achieve a \ncomprehensive platform, supported unanimously by \nMember States, for reform of the United Nations and \nits working methods and decision-making processes. In \nthat regard, my country believes that we should begin \nwith the make-up of the Security Council, the \ndefinition of its competence and responsibilities, and \ninstitutional relations between the Council and the \nGeneral Assembly in order to ensure the Organization\u2019s \neffectiveness and to fairly and accurately reflect, in a \nbalanced manner, the will of the entire international \ncommunity.  \n In that context, I remind the Assembly that \nMauritania is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on \nthe Security Council for the biennium 2012-2013, \nrepresenting the Group of African States. Support for \nour candidacy was expressed by our continental \norganization, the African Union, at its Addis Ababa \nsummit in January and Malabo summit in June. It also \nsupports our conviction and profound belief in the \nmission and principles of the United Nations and our \nsincere will to effectively contribute to the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, play a \npositive role in the Security Council, and assume \ngreater responsibilities in order to attain the noble \nobjectives for which this Organization was created. \n I note that Mauritania has adopted a policy of \npeaceful coexistence and good-neighbourly relations \nwith the countries of its region. It is not party to any \nconflict and enjoys excellent and friendly relations \nwith all countries of the world. I take this opportunity \nto sincerely thank all of the friendly, kindred States that \nhave supported our candidacy. \n We note with deep satisfaction the gargantuan \nefforts made during the sixty-fifth session, including \nthe High-level Meeting on Youth and the High-level \nPlenary Meeting on the MDGs and the need to \nimplement them. Nevertheless, we note and deplore the \nfact that the populations of most States continue to live \nin dire economic conditions that are not conducive to \nthe achievement of the MDGs.  \n In that context, allow me to recall the steep rise in \nunemployment, especially among young people; the \nincreased rate of abject poverty, especially in the most \n \n \n3 11-51670 \n \nvulnerable sectors of society; the decelerated growth in \ngross domestic product; the global recession; decreased \nofficial foreign investment, especially in Africa; the \nvolatility of basic commodity prices, which has had \ndevastating effects on the buying power of large \nsectors of the populations of developing countries; \nreduced net transfers to developing countries; \ndecreased tourist revenue; increased maternal and \nnewborn death rates; and the increased debt burden. \n This latter issue is already a terrible economic \nburden on developing countries, and leads to the \nemptying of public coffers that are modest to begin \nwith, especially in the light of their infrastructure and \npublic service needs. In such economic conditions, the \neconomies of the least developed countries face many \nenormous obstacles, making it increasingly difficult to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. As we \napproach the deadline for achieving the MDGs, many \ndeveloping countries remain far from doing so.  \n We call on wealthy developed States to \ncontribute, in accordance with their promises, to the \nrevival of these least developed countries so that they \ncan provide acceptable levels of public services and \nguarantee civil peace, security and stability, and to \nstrengthen the social fabric of these countries, which in \nturn will contribute to international peace and security. \n Non-communicable diseases are another \nimportant public health issue. The extent of the spread \nof these diseases is truly catastrophic, and mortality \nrates are higher than those of all other diseases. \nFurthermore, their effects on health and the social and \neconomic fields are a further obstacle to the attainment \nof the MDGs, especially Goals 4 and 5 relative to \nmaternal and child health, which are closely linked to \nnon-communicable diseases. This is especially true \nbecause malnutrition in pregnancy and early childhood \nis the source of hypertension and diabetes later in life.  \n This is why I note with satisfaction that my \ncountry has risen to the challenge posed by these \ndiseases by establishing extensive health infrastructure \nand strengthening the human resources available to \ndeal with such diseases. We have also built a \nspecialized oncology hospital with the latest \ntechnology, a modern hospital for cardiovascular \ndisease, a diabetes treatment centre and over 50 dialysis \ncentres. All of these have been established in record \ntime, less than two years since the accession to power \nof Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz following the \npresidential elections of 18 July 2009.  \n Our country is closely following the situation in \nthe Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the \nefforts of the Secretary-General and his Special \nRepresentative to reach a comprehensive, lasting and \njust solution that enjoys the support of both countries, \nin order to strengthen peace and security in the area \nand to create an Arab Maghreb that is open to progress \nand development and responds to the aspirations of its \npeoples. This is a strategic option for my country. \n I believe that the Israeli-Arab conflict is a source \nof tension and a threat to peace and security in a \nsensitive and vital region of the world. My country \nsupports efforts for peace that will guarantee the \nrecovery of all the rights of the Palestinian people and \nthe creation of an independent Palestinian State within \nthe 4 June 1967 borders, with its capital in Jerusalem, \ncoexisting in peace and security with the State of \nIsrael.  \n This is why the Islamic Republic of Mauritania \ncalls on the international community to recognize \nPalestine as an independent sovereign State and to \nfacilitate its full membership of the United Nations on \nthe basis of the request made last week by \nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, Executive Secretary of the \nPalestine Liberation Organization and President of the \nPalestinian Authority. We must be faithful to the \nhistoric responsibilities of the international community \ntowards Palestine; uphold justice, credibility and \nfairness with regard to this question; and ensure respect \nfor the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy. \nWe condemn the ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip \nand the acts committed by the Israeli military machine, \nkilling civilians and destroying Palestinian facilities.  \n We call for concerted Arab, regional and \ninternational efforts to assist our Libyan brothers and \nsisters. We seek an end to the killings and a response to \nthe legitimate aspirations to reform and change of our \nkindred people of Libya in order to guarantee their \nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We call on the \ninternational community to support the Libyan people \nand provide for all their needs in various areas so as to \nensure the success of the transitional phase.  \n We also call on the international community to \nintensify and accelerate the international response to \nthe tragic humanitarian situation resulting from the \nacute drought in the Horn of Africa. Speedy assistance \n  \n \n11-51670 4 \n \nmust be provided to the hundreds of thousands of \nSomalis citizens who have been forced to become \nrefugees and are enduring tragic living and security \nconditions. Although our means are modest, we have \nprovided assistance in the amount of $1 million to \nsupport the efforts of the African Union on behalf of \nthe people of Somalia.  \n For many years now, our region, the African \nSahel, has been the stage for the expansion of \norganized crime networks that traffic in drugs, \nweapons, ammunition and human beings, and are \nresponsible for illegal migration flows across the area, \nkidnappings, abductions and terrorism. They pose a \nreal threat to the peace and stability of our region.  \n We are convinced that there is a direct and close \nrelationship between peace, development and \ndemocracy. For this reason, we believe that peace and \nsecurity are preconditions to achieving development \nand democracy and to strengthening the rule of law \ninstitutions. We have adopted laws, prepared plans and \ntaken steps to guarantee peace, security and safety for \nour citizens and foreign citizens living legally in \nMauritania. Our security system has responded firmly \nand courageously to the threats of criminal terrorist \ngroups against our security and that of our guests. We \nhave succeeded in guaranteeing peace within our \nborders and security at border points, as attested to by \nall. We work in full understanding and coordination \nwith Algeria, Mali and Niger to suppress the activities \nand free movement of these criminal terrorist groups. \n The culture of peace, the ideals of tolerance \namong nations and civilizations, and upholding justice \nand law among peoples are the best ways to advance \non the road to peace and security in our world. \nHowever, when issues remain pending for years; when \nthere is a growing gap between rich and poor; when \ninternational economic institutions are fragile and \nweak; and when justice, fairness and equality are so \nslow to be provided, tensions will increase and \nextremism and terrorism spread. We in Mauritania \nreject terrorism in every form, and we adhere to the \npeaceful principles of Islam \u2014 principles of tolerance \nand brotherhood that reject violence and extremism. \nWe believe that the international community should \nconsider seriously why terrorism exists and root it out \nvigorously. \n The international community must honour the \ncommitments it has made since the Organization was \nestablished, but it can do so only if all the States and \npeoples of the world are able to benefit from available \npotential and resources and if development efforts in \ndeveloping countries are supported so that people can \nlive in dignity, freedom and equality. That is the only \nway we can achieve the noble goals that this \nOrganization set for itself when it was created."

        "file_text": "I begin \nby congratulating the President on his election to \npreside over this principal organ in which we all strive \nto achieve the purposes of the United Nations. \n I also wish the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, the greatest possible success in carrying out \nhis mission of promoting peace and progress around \nthe world with the same effectiveness as he \ndemonstrated throughout his first mandate. \n I also warmly congratulate the representatives of \nthe new State of South Sudan, which has joined the \nUnited Nations family during the current session. \n The economic and financial crisis continues to be \na cause of serious concern for the entire world; its \nconsequences are seen in many different fields. The \ncapacity of the international community to take action \nto address any type of crisis, and to do so in a timely \nmanner, is limited. This restrains the fight against \npoverty and puts at risk the implementation of \nsustainable development policies, which are needed \nnow more than ever. \n Spain, together with its European Union partners, \nis taking difficult decisions in order to tackle the crisis. \nHowever, beyond the actions taken at the regional and \nnational levels, it is essential to undertake a \n  \n \n11-51378 12 \n \ncoordinated global response. The United Nations \nsystem is an important part of the solution to the crisis. \n Women\u2019s equality is a fundamental human right, \nbased upon the concept of equality among all human \nbeings. Advancing women\u2019s full and equal access to \nthe labour market, as well as to the political and social \nworld, is not only ethically imperative, but an essential \nmeasure to overcome the crisis. \n Since 1 January, the United Nations has been able \nto count on an instrument to assist Member States to \nachieve that goal: UN-Women. Its Executive Director, \nMs. Michelle Bachelet, will boost this effort. I assure \nher of Spain\u2019s full support. We will be at the side of all \nwomen who fight for freedom and equality. \n Over the past few months we have witnessed \nepisodes of rebellion in which peoples have fought \nagainst the tyranny of rulers who denied basic human \nrights, as well as the dignity and value of human \nbeings, preventing people from participating in their \ncountries\u2019 political life and from making use of their \nresources and opportunities. \n We celebrate the success of the popular \nmovements in Tunisia and Egypt and we join the \nefforts of the international community to support and \nstrengthen the political transition processes in both \ncountries, led by their own peoples. \n The Libyan people will also be able to enjoy \nfreedom and live in democracy after decades of \ndictatorship and months of conflict. We have welcomed \nthe Libyan representatives in the General Assembly, \nwith the satisfaction of knowing that the United \nNations, by implementing its principles, has remained \nat the side of the Libyan people. \n We now have the obligation to continue to help \nthe Libyan people in the reconciliation and \nreconstruction processes. We are ready to do so, and \nwe will do it under the guidance of the United Nations, \nfollowing the pace set by the Libyans themselves. \n Unfortunately, the international community \ncontinues to witness with indignation the brutal \nrepression of civilian demonstrators by the Syrian \nauthorities. I firmly condemn those actions once again, \nand reiterate the need for the international community \nto take measures to stop the repression. \n The Tunisian, Egyptian and Libyan revolutions, \nthe Syrian uprising and the acceleration of the reform \nprocesses in Morocco and Jordan are part of a \nprofound transformation of the Arab world, with \nsignificant consequences for the region and for the \ninternational community as a whole. The legitimate \naspiration of the Palestinian people to enjoy freedom \ncannot be left out of this wave of change. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict has been with the \nUnited Nations almost since the Organization\u2019s \nfounding. This session may be remembered as the one \nin which the General Assembly granted Palestine the \nstatus of observer State. Spain could support such a \ndecision, for a number of reasons. \n First, the international community recognizes that \na solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict requires the \nexistence of two States, Israeli and Palestinian, living \nside by side in peace and security. \n Secondly, after more than 60 years of conflict, the \ninternational community should send a clear signal to \nthe Palestinians underlining that its commitment in \nfavour of the creation of the Palestinian State is deep \nand unambiguous. \n Thirdly, in the year in which the Arab Spring \nchanged realities in the Arab world \u2014 and, indeed, in \nthe world at large \u2014 the just, legitimate and long-\nstanding aspiration of the Palestinians to live in dignity \nin their own State, free from occupation and its \naccompanying suffering, deserves a clear response \nfrom the international community, a response that can \nno longer be postponed. \n This new step could be conceived as a stage \ntowards the legitimate objective of Palestine\u2019s \nbecoming a Member State of the United Nations with \nfull rights. \n Effective, sustainable peace can only be achieved \nthrough negotiations between the parties. Spain \nbelieves that the Palestinians could find in this new \nstatus a stimulus for the prompt resumption of \nnegotiations. Precisely because that is the shared goal \nof the parties and the international community, such a \nsituation should not be used for actions incompatible \nwith the spirit of negotiations. Israel should also \ncontribute to this spirit by refraining from measures \nthat prejudge the final status. \n Spain is coordinating its position with its \nEuropean Union partners. I am grateful for the efforts \nof the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, to \nreactivate the negotiations, in a way acceptable to all \n \n \n13 11-51378 \n \nEuropean Union member States, and the declaration of \nthe Quartet, which Spain assesses very positively. \n Spain\u2019s engagement with the Palestinian people \nand their struggle against occupation is long-standing \nand known to everyone. Spain has always given \npolitical, economic and moral support to the legitimate \naspirations of the Palestinians. \n On the other hand, the historical relations \nbetween Spain and the Jewish people date back many \ncenturies. Spain\u2019s historical identity cannot be \nunderstood without its Arab and Jewish heritage. \n I wish to underscore Spain\u2019s commitment to \nIsrael with regard to the endeavour to create a \nhomeland for the Jewish people. Since its founding, \nIsrael has experienced a number of wars and has \nsuffered from terrorism against its civilian population. \nFor Spain, the security of this young State born out of \nan ancient people is essential.  \n The best way to preserve that State is through a \npeace treaty that, among other things, provides for the \nestablishment of a Palestinian State along the 1967 \nlines, with agreed swaps and with Jerusalem as a \nshared capital. The security of Israel and Palestine will \nrequire effective guarantees in the future peace \nagreement, including possible international participation, \nshould the parties request it. \n The future peace agreement should look to the \nfuture, turning its back on the painful years of conflict. \nTherefore, Israel and Palestine have to be certain that \nclaims originating from the conflict will be overcome \nwith their signature of the peace agreement. \n  In addition, the solution to the painful tragedy of \nthe Palestinian refugees must be a just one agreed by \nall the parties concerned, while allowing the \npreservation of Israel\u2019s current character. The \nPalestinian State will be, in this regard as well, a key \nelement for the final resolution of the conflict. \n Some voices have raised concerns that the new \ndemocracies may be home to political groups with \nradical or extremist ideologies. Democracy is an open \nand fair system of political participation that must also \nbe able to defend itself against possible threats. \n Fortunately, we can count on instruments that \nmay contribute to preventing such situations. The \nUnited Nations Alliance of Civilizations, which \npromotes intercultural dialogue and cooperation, is a \nclear example. The Regional Strategy for the \nMediterranean, developed within the Alliance \nframework, may help, through youth programmes and \ncampaigns to raise awareness, to diffuse democratic \nvalues and respect for human rights, always in \ncoexistence with those of local cultures. \n We have to prevent Al-Qaida\u2019s terrorism from \nbeing reinforced in the Sahel region through the release \nof uncontrolled weapons. The international community \nmust be united in the fight against this curse that \nrepresents a scourge to countries such as Afghanistan \nand Pakistan, in the same irrational and cruel way as \nthat in which it struck New York, Bali, Madrid, \nLondon, Mumbai, Moscow and many other places over \nthe past decade.  \n The United Nations itself recently suffered the \nconsequences of a terrible terrorist attack in Abuja, \nadding to those previously endured in Baghdad and \nAlgiers, among others. Once again, I extend our \ncondolences to the Secretary-General, and express our \nsolidarity with the victims and their families, as well as \nwith the hard-working members of staff of the United \nNations. \n The tenth anniversary of the attack on the Twin \nTowers in the city of New York took place a few days \nago. We have lived through a bloody decade since the \nattack, in spite of the determined fight of the \ninternational community against terrorism.  \n I firmly believe in, and reaffirm, the need to \nstrengthen international cooperation in order to prevent \nand fight terrorism. Every country must assume the \nobligation to address this universal scourge. That is \nwhy Spain joined, from the beginning, the initiative \nregarding the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The \nForum was launched just a few days ago.  \n We firmly support United Nations initiatives \nwithin the framework of its Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy, as well as the efforts of the Security Council \nand of the Secretariat to rationalize the existing \nstructures in order to reach the goals that we have set \nin this area. \n Spain is especially sensitive with regard to the \nvictims of terrorism. Unfairly forgotten at times, they \ncannot be mentioned only as a rhetoric tool. Rather, \nthere should be an effective commitment to give them \nrecognition, remember them and provide them the \nassistance and support that they deserve. That is how \n  \n \n11-51378 14 \n \nwe have understood the position of victims in Spain, \nand we have passed legislation on the issue, giving us \none of the most advanced and efficient models in the \nworld in assisting the victims of terrorism. \n Spain follows very closely the dynamism of a \nregion with strong links with Spain \u2014 Latin America. \nThe strength of the Latin American economy is \nessential to overcome the crisis and to create a new \ninternational economic governance. \n That is why enhancing and consolidating a broad \ndialogue with Latin America is crucial. The dialogue \nshould include the big issues on the global agenda, \nsuch as the design of an ambitious and innovative \ninternational financial architecture, as well as the \nresponse to climate change, energy, security and \nmigration. \n Latin America\u2019s regional integration has been an \nengine fuelling its growth and improving \nunderstanding. Spain has always wished to support this \nprocess in the framework of the Ibero-American \nSummits. \n Other regions of the world also deserve special \nattention because of the tragic situations of their \npopulations as a result of drought and other endemic \nproblems.  \n The situation in the Horn of Africa is intolerable. \nWe are contributing to alleviating the famine in \nSomalia, in coordination with other donors and United \nNations agencies. However, humanitarian aid, despite \nbeing a priority, is only a first step towards \ndevelopment. We still have a long way to go in many \nparts of the world. \n I therefore reaffirm Spain\u2019s commitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals. The fight against \npoverty is a fundamental objective of my country\u2019s aid \nand cooperation for development policy. The challenge \nof the Millennium Development Goals should \nencourage us to redouble our efforts to achieve them \nwithin the deadline that has been set. \n However, in order to realize the Goals and to \nprovide a future for generations to come, we must \nmake the most of meetings such as the one to be held \nin Rio de Janeiro in 2012, where the intention is to \nforge a new paradigm that should allow us to combine \nthe Millennium Development Goals with environmental \nsustainability. \n It is also important to take advantage of the \nmomentum created by the Canc\u00fan Conference in 2010 \non the climate change negotiating process. We will \ncontinue to contribute to the process constructively, \ntogether with our European Union partners, at the \nupcoming Durban Conference. \n The financial crisis affecting the global economy \ncannot be an excuse to avoid our commitments. On the \ncontrary, it should encourage us to fulfil them. That is \nwhy Spain believes in supporting the development of \ninnovative financing instruments \u2014 in other words, the \ndevelopment of mechanisms through which to mobilize \nmid-term and long-term additional financial resources. \nThat should be done in a way that is stable and \npredictable, as well as being complementary to official \ndevelopment aid, which should be maintained, come \nwhat may. Spain currently chairs the leading Pilot \nGroup on innovative financing for development, of \nwhich we have great hopes. \n Spain\u2019s support for, and participation in, the \nactivities of the Organization relating to the \nmaintenance of peace and security in diverse parts of \nthe world also demonstrates our commitment to the \nachievement of the purposes of the United Nations. \nAlmost 1,200 Spaniards actively participate today in \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, with an \nespecially prominent presence in the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon, a mission essential to \nmaintaining stability in the south of the country, as \nwell as to helping its economic development. \n I thank the Secretary-General for participating in \nthe inauguration of the United Nations base in Quart de \nPoblet, Valencia, thus recognizing Spain\u2019s commitment \nto the United Nations. The construction of the base, \nwhich Spain provided to the United Nations, will, as \nthe Secretary-General said, facilitate the work of the \nOrganization, enhance the reliability of its \ncommunications and considerably improve the safety \nand security of staff in the field. \n Spain is very proud of its participation in United \nNations operations. We intend to maintain a firm, \nactive, permanent commitment to the Organization and \nits purposes. In line with that commitment, Spain \nannounced in 2005 its candidature for a non-permanent \nseat on the Security Council for the biennium 2015-\n2016. We hope that, with the support of Member \nStates, we shall have a seat on the Council and in that \nposition continue working for the preservation of \n \n \n15 11-51378 \n \ninternational security and stability. At the same time, \nwe will strive to promote development and human \nrights as fundamental pillars of lasting peace. \n A year ago, Libyan, Egyptian and Tunisian men \nand women witnessed the Assembly meeting while \nthey were still under the oppression of dictatorial \nregimes. Today they own their future. They have \nfought for it. The international community has \nprotected and supported them. They, on their part, have \ngiven us hope. We can now hope that change is \npossible. There is no insurmountable challenge. \n We are today certain that the international \ncommunity, guided by the United Nations, is on the \npath of peace and freedom."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you, \nSir, on your election to the very important post of the \nhighest representative of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-sixth session. \n A few days ago New York City and the entire \nworld remembered the tenth anniversary of the tragic \nevents of 11 September. I should like to use this \nopportunity to pay homage to all the victims and to the \nfirefighters and other rescue workers who died in \nconnection with the 2001 attacks. We should not forget \nthem. \n The main topic suggested for the sixty-sixth \nsession \u2014 the mediation of disputes by peaceful \nmeans \u2014 is at the very core of the United Nations \nCharter, and I can assure members it is also at the core \nof the foreign policy principles of the country I have \nthe privilege to represent, the Czech Republic. Nineteen years ago the dissolution of \nCzechoslovakia was negotiated peacefully from within, \nwithout any need for external mediation. Our \nexperience tells us that if a solution to any country\u2019s \naspirations to sovereignty and freedom, or a solution to \na dispute among countries, is to be lasting and \nacceptable for the citizens of those countries, that \nsolution must primarily come from within the region \nitself and from the negotiations of the countries \nconcerned. In the same spirit, the Czech Republic is \nconvinced, with regard to the most important issue of \nthis session of the General Assembly, that it is \nnecessary for the two sides in the Israeli-Palestinian \ndispute to find a way forward themselves.  \n I agree with President Obama that there is no \nshortcut to ending a conflict that has endured for \ndecades. It requires that both sides take an innovative \napproach and overcome some old, inflexible and rigid \nschemes of thought. It requires both sides to negotiate \nand to find a balanced solution that will last. Such a \nsolution cannot come through unilateral steps, neither \nthose forced by the United Nations nor the steps taken \nby one side of the dispute only.  \n The Czech Republic successfully completed the \ntransition from communism to democracy, and, based \non that experience, we wish the countries of North \nAfrica to make progress in the same direction. We \nknow it is not an easy path. To remove several leading \npoliticians is not the crucial aspect of the much-needed \nsystemic change.  \n When the Iron Curtain fell in Europe more than \n20 years ago, I used to talk about three mutually \ninterconnected preconditions for successful \ntransformation: a clear and transparent concept of \nwhere to go, a feasible strategy how to get there, and to \nbe able to motivate the citizens of the country to \n  \n \n11-51185 8 \n \npromote it. I still do not see these preconditions in \nsome of the countries of North Africa.  \n By saying that, I want to stress that the systemic \nchange cannot be agreed upon or prearranged at \ninternational conferences. It cannot be mediated or \npassively acquired as a foreign investment. It is a \ndomestic task and a sequence of policies, not a once-\nfor-all policy change.  \n There is something we can do, however. We can \nand should increase our efforts to cooperate with the \ncountries of North Africa. We should not forget that \nthere is a complementarity between freedom and trade. \nOur relations \u2014 and now I speak especially about us, \nthe European Union member States \u2014 with the \ncountries of North Africa should be based on free \ntrade, which means on trade with a minimum of \nregulation and arbitrary standards. Prosperity in the \ncountries of North Africa is a guarantee of stability and \nis also a precondition for preventing growing migration \nto the countries in Southern and Western Europe. \n I should also like to mention another issue that I \nsee as crucial, that of nuclear energy. I welcome the \nfact that the Secretary-General called for a special \nmeeting on this topic. The Czech Republic pays the \nhighest possible attention to nuclear safety and security \nand supports the further development of nuclear \nenergy.  \n What happened in Japan in March this year was a \nserious natural catastrophe, and there are certainly \nlessons to be learned from it. The main lesson is \nobvious. Even coastal locations, which are seen as \nseismically stable for urban planning, can be affected \nby earthquakes far away under the sea. Nuclear power \nplants should be built in locations that are the least \nprone to damage by natural disasters. Yet after the \ntsunami hit the Fukushima power plant, some \nGovernments decided not to build new nuclear power \nplants and some even to abandon nuclear energy as \nsuch.  \n Speaking for the Czech Republic, we consider \nthat what happened in Fukushima did not by any means \nquestion the arguments for nuclear energy. These \narguments are strong, economically rational and \nconvincing. Nuclear power is a stable, legitimate and, \nin some countries, irreplaceable source of energy \ntoday. \n Let me conclude by saying that the Czech \nRepublic continues to support the much-needed reform \nof the Security Council. The world has changed \nconsiderably since the United Nations Charter was \nsigned. New countries must take greater responsibility \nfor this Organization and for its financing.  \n This year the Czech Republic holds the \npresidency of the Executive Board of the United \nNations Development Programme, which supports \nprojects in 177 countries. We support that Programme \nbut want to stress that in order for developing countries \nto develop, all kinds of unnecessary barriers, standards, \nregulations and other constraints in the developed \nworld must first be removed.  \n I wish the President every success in his office \nand assure him that the Czech Republic will continue \nto be an active Member of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "Nearly 66 years ago, in \n1946, one of my predecessors was privileged to \nrepresent Canada at the first session of the General \nAssembly. It is an honour to follow in those footsteps \nand to renew Canada\u2019s commitment to the founding \nprinciples of the United Nations, namely, to maintain \ninternational peace and security; to prevent and \nremove threats to peace; to suppress acts of aggression; \nto respect the principle of equal rights and the self-\ndetermination of peoples; to strengthen universal \npeace; and to promote and encourage respect for \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. This \nHall symbolizes the promise of humankind and what \nwe can accomplish by working together to uphold \nthose founding principles. \n Yet, only a short distance from here is an entirely \ndifferent symbol - ground zero. The date 9/11 was a \nstark reminder that evil exists, that life is fragile, that \nfreedom has enemies, and that the poison of radical \nterrorism is all too real. It serves as a reminder that, as \nfar as humankind has advanced, threats to peace, \nsecurity and human dignity remain. \n In that context, I wish to share reflections on \nthree areas: first, the principles that motivate Canada\u2019s \napproach to foreign policy; secondly, the basis for \nCanada\u2019s support of multilateral organizations and \nmultilateral action; and thirdly, a way forward for the \nUnited Nations. \n The founding principles of these United Nations \nare more than mere words. It is our duty to pull them \nfrom the printed page, to breathe life into them and to \npractise them every day. In everyday practice, it is not \neasy to uphold principles. It requires struggle and \nsacrifice. Some pay the ultimate price. \n The world remembers Secretary-General Dag \nHammarskj\u00f6ld, who was killed 50 years ago this \nmonth. We honour him for his integrity, his principles \nand for his great courage in confronting power. We also \nremember that it was Canada\u2019s Prime Minister, John \nDiefenbaker, who, just a year earlier, stood at this very \n  \n \n11-51390 30 \n \nrostrum to respond to unjust attacks against him. \nCanada did not hesitate to defend the Office and the \nperson of the Secretary-General. \n That is the Canadian tradition \u2014 standing for \nwhat is principled and just, regardless of whether it is \npopular, convenient or expedient. Over the past \ncentury, the world was infected by a lethal combination \nof utopian ideology and brutal despotism that spawned \ntotalitarian regimes that enslaved their own peoples. \nApologists tried to persuade us that the ideology of \nCommunism was benign. Canadians knew better. We \ntook a stand for freedom and fundamental human \nrights. We stood against oppression in Germany and in \nUkraine. We stood with its brave people, and those of \nthe other captive nations of central and Eastern Europe. \n Canada does not go along in order to get along. \nWe will go along only if we go in a direction that \nadvances Canada\u2019s values: freedom, democracy, human \nrights and the rule of law. Also, Canada would not go \nalong to support the farce of a major proliferator of \nnuclear arms presiding over the Conference on \nDisarmament. When North Korea relinquished the \npresidency, we resumed our engagement in the \nConference. Canada\u2019s tough economic sanctions \nagainst that rogue regime remain in place, and we \ncontinue to advocate and advance reform in how the \nPresident of that important body is selected. \n We would not go along with appeasement of the \nformer Al-Qadhafi regime, nor would we look the other \nway when the Lockerbie mass murderer received a \nhero\u2019s welcome and the Colonel\u2019s embrace. We would \nnot look the other way as the Al-Qadhafi regime, \nblatantly disregarding human rights and the rule of law, \nwaged war on the people of Libya. \n Canada backs our principles with action: \nproviding military support to NATO\u2019s Operation \nUnified Protector; recognizing the National Transitional \nCouncil as Libya\u2019s transitional Government; co-founding \nthe Libya Contact Group; and giving early, strong and \ncontinuing support to the Libyan people\u2019s struggle \nagainst tyranny. \n Canada would not simply go along or look \nelsewhere when the Al-Assad regime started killing \nSyrian men, women and children in a despicable and \ndesperate attempt to cling to power. We imposed tough \nsanctions on the regime and its backers. \n Canada will not go along with a double standard \nthat castigates some United Nations Members for \nalleged failings, while ignoring the notorious abuses of \nothers. We supported the aspirations of those peoples \nwho sought brighter futures for themselves and their \ncountries during the Arab spring that has just passed. \n However, we will not go along with the unilateral \nactions of the Palestinian Authority. Just a few days \nago, the Quartet laid the foundation for a return to \nnegotiation. Our Government\u2019s position has been \nclear \u2014 the only solution to the issue is one that is \nnegotiated by the two parties themselves. We continue \nto encourage both sides to accept those principles and \nto return to direct talks, based on a two-State solution, \nwithout delay or precondition.  \n We uphold Israel\u2019s right to exist. We uphold its \nfundamental right, like any Member State, to defend \ninnocent civilians against acts of terrorism. Just as \nFascism and Communism were the great struggles of \nprevious generations, terrorism is the great struggle of \nours. Far too often, the Jewish State is on the front line \nin our struggle and its people are the victims of terror. \n Canada will not accept or stay silent while the \nJewish State is attacked for defending its territory and \nits citizens. The Second World War taught us all the \ntragic price of going along just to get along. It was \naccommodation and appeasement that allowed Fascism \nto gather strength. As Winston Churchill said, an \nappeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will \neat him last. \n We respect State sovereignty, but Canada will not \ngo along or look the other way when a minority is \ndenied its human rights or fundamental freedoms. It is \nour common duty to uphold the rights of the afflicted \nand to give a voice to the voiceless.  \n As citizens of the global community, we have a \nsolemn duty to defend the vulnerable, to challenge \naggression and to protect and promote human rights \nand human dignity, at home and abroad: women, \nChristians, Baha\u2019i and other victims of persecution in \nIran; Roman Catholic priests, other Christian clergy \nand their laity, driven to worship underground in \nChina; Christians being driven out of Iraq by Al-Qaida; \nand Copts being assaulted and killed in Egypt. In \nBurma, the regime discriminates against several forms \nof Buddhism and restricts the activities of Muslims. In \nother places, the Ahmadiyya community faces real \nviolence. Gays and lesbians are threatened with the \n \n \n31 11-51390 \n \ncriminalization of their sexuality in Uganda, and other \nminorities are subjected to persecution, oppression or \nviolence. Our nationalities are many but we share one \nhumanity. \n I am pleased to report that Canada will be \ncreating an office of religious freedom within our \nGovernment at the heart of my own Department. The \noffice will promote freedom of religion and of \nconscience as key objectives of Canadian foreign \npolicy. The long history of humankind has proved that \nreligious freedom and democratic freedom are \ninseparable. As Franklin Roosevelt observed on the eve \nof global war,  \n \u201c[w]here freedom of religion has been attacked, \nthe attack has come from sources opposed to \ndemocracy. Where democracy has been \noverthrown, the spirit of free worship has \ndisappeared. And where religion and democracy \nhave vanished, good faith and reason in \ninternational affairs have given way to strident \nambition and brute force\u201d.  \n That brings me to Canada\u2019s support of \nmultilateral institutions and multilateral action. Some \nyears ago, a former Secretary-General referred to \nenlightened multilateralism as the guarantor, not the \nenemy, of State sovereignty and the integrity of State. \nState sovereignty is not created by multilateral \ninstitutions. Instead, multilateral institutions exist and \nderive legitimacy from the independent decisions of \nsovereign States. \n Canada\u2019s position in that regard was explained by \nour Prime Minister just last year. Referring to \nmultilateral action to address the world economic \ncrisis, Stephen Harper said that he saw world \nleadership, at its best, as a glimpse of a hopeful future \nwhere we act together for the good of all; the world we \nhave been trying to build since 1945; the world we \nwant for our children and for our grandchildren. It can \nbe done if we act together.  \n Enlightened sovereignty, multilateral institutions \nand multilateral action result from a collection of \nsovereign decisions based on individual States\u2019 own \ninterests, not narrow self-interest in sovereignty\u2019s \nname, but an expanded view of mutual interest in \nwhich there is room for all to grow and for all to \nprosper. Canada calls that enlightened sovereignty. It is \nthe natural extension of enlightened self-interest. \n As Canada\u2019s Prime Minister noted when he \naddressed the General Assembly last year, the United \nNations Charter is animated by \u201cthe idea that what is \ngood for others may well be the best way to pursue \none\u2019s own interests\u201d (A/65/PV.11, p. 46) \u2014 in other \nwords, enlightened sovereignty. \n The world knows that we can accomplish great \nthings by working together. This year, collective action \nunder United Nations sanction helped to limit the loss \nof life in Libya and ultimately ended a criminal, \nillegitimate regime\u2019s war on the people whom it \nclaimed to represent. Canada was tremendously proud \nto take part in its demise. Our Royal Canadian Air \nForce flew 10 per cent of the total strike sorties against \nAl-Qadhafi\u2019s forces and our Royal Canadian Navy \nhelped enforce the maritime blockade. \n Canada has paid heavily, both in dollar terms and \nin a costly human toll, to fulfil our United Nations \nobligation to support the lawful Government of \nAfghanistan. We used our chairmanship of the Group \nof Eight to reach out to leaders from Africa and the \nAmericas and to secure an agreement to enact the \nMuskoka Initiative for maternal, newborn and child \nhealth. \n That progress will help to meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal of reducing the appalling mortality \namong mothers and children in developing countries. \nWorking with like-minded nations, Canada continues \nto make significant financial contributions towards \npeace, humanitarian assistance, development aid and \nsecurity in the Sudans. Collective action does not mean \nuniformity. \n For example, Canada works closely with like-\nminded countries to advance human rights and \ndemocracy in Burma. At the same time, we imposed \nthe toughest sanctions in the world against that \ncountry\u2019s repressive military regime. Similarly, when \nCanada placed strong restrictions on Syria\u2019s current \nregime, we acted independently, but in close \nconsultation and cooperation with other nations. \n In the defence of freedom and human rights, form \ncannot prevail over substance. The determinant is \nwhich route produces the best results. While \nmultilateral action should be preferred, failure to \nachieve consensus must not prevent the willing from \nacting to uphold human rights and the founding \nprinciples of the United Nations. \n  \n \n11-51390 32 \n \n Margaret Thatcher was once reported to have said \nthat \u201cconsensus seems to be the process of abandoning \nall beliefs, principles, values and policies. So it is \nsomething in which no one believes\u201d. That leads to my \nthird topic \u2014 the challenges to the relevance and the \neffectiveness of this important Organization. \n Canada has been a consistently reliable and \nresponsible participant in United Nations initiatives \naround the world. We are the seventh largest \ncontributor to United Nations finances. The citizens of \nthe world deserve that the United Nations abide by the \nsame principles observed by so many Governments of \nMember States: accountability, transparency and \nethics; financial responsibility and fiscal austerity; \nefficiency and the elimination of waste and \nduplication; regular reviews to sunset unnecessary, \nredundant and obsolete mandates; and zero tolerance \nfor conflicts of interest, fraud and corruption. \n Yet, the challenges faced by this Organization \nextend beyond financial probity and operational \neffectiveness. This Organization is a forum for debate \nand dialogue, but it must also be a force for positive \naction to make the world a better place. As a former \nCanadian Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, told this \nAssembly during his defence of the world\u2019s persecuted \nminorities: \u201cWe are not here in this Assembly to win \nwars of propaganda. We are here to win victories for \npeace.\u201d (A/PV.871, para. 225)  \n The relevance and effectiveness of the United \nNations are imperilled when the founding principles \nare observed in word but not in deed. Such is the case \nwhen the presidency of the Conference on \nDisarmament passes to a regime involved in the illicit \ntransfers of weapons, material and technology; or when \nIran, which mocks the values of this Organization \nthrough such outrages as refusing to allow entry to  \n \nUnited Nations observers on human rights, is permitted \nto seek leadership roles, such as the vice-presidency of \nthe General Assembly and a seat on the Commission on \nPopulation and Development; or when objection is \ntaken on petty, procedural or process-based grounds to \nreporting that speaks about credible allegations of war \ncrimes committed in Sri Lanka; or when blatant \nviolators of women\u2019s rights are welcomed to the \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination against Women, often despite \nreservations that are incompatible with the object and \npurpose of the very Convention. \n Canada has consistently opposed the debasement \nof multilateral institutions by conduct that is \ninconsistent with their values. For example, this year \nmarks the fiftieth anniversary of Canada\u2019s principled \nrefusal to support membership in the Commonwealth \nof Nations by South Africa\u2019s then apartheid regime. \n The greatest enemies of the United Nations are \nnot those who publicly repudiate its actions. The \ngreatest enemies of the United Nations are those who \nquietly undermine its principles or, even worse, who sit \nidly, watching its slow decline. We cannot sit idly. \n Canada is a vigorous defender of freedom, \ndemocracy and the rule of law. As our Prime Minister \nremarked earlier this month,  \n \u201cwe are not a country that makes war for gain or \nfor territory. We do not fight for glory. If we \ncovet honour, it is only a reputation for doing the \nright thing in a good cause\u201d. \n That is all. That is enough. If I may be so bold, \nthat is why the countries of the world came together in \nthe United Nations - to do the right thing in a good \ncause. The cause is peace, justice, freedom and \nopportunity for all."

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nPresident Jurelang Zedkaia, I bring warm greetings \nfrom the Republic of the Marshall Islands to the \nGeneral Assembly. The Marshall Islands also welcomes \nSouth Sudan as the newest Member of the \nOrganization. \n The Marshall Islands congratulates the Secretary-\nGeneral for making nuclear disarmament and nuclear \nsafety a top priority at the United Nations during his \nsecond term. Fifty-seven years ago, at the dawn of the \nCold War, the United Nations held the Marshallese \npeople in trust. Marshallese leaders petitioned the \nUnited Nations to put a halt to the testing of nuclear \nweapons. The United Nations responded with \nTrusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV), adopted \nin 1954, and 1493 (XVII), adopted in 1956. Acting \nwith assurances of our protection, the United Nations \nand its administering authority, the United States, \ndetonated 67 large-scale nuclear explosions in the \nMarshall Islands. For decades, Marshallese leaders \nhave returned to the United Nations to speak of the \ncontinuing impacts \u2014 cancer, fear and continued exile \nfrom our homeland \u2014 and of a science where \ngoalposts are always moving. \n Three weeks ago, the leaders of the Pacific \nIslands Forum, in their communiqu\u00e9, not only \nrecognized the special responsibility of the United \nStates of America but also agreed to support the \nMarshall Islands at the United Nations, including in \naddressing the issue of the Secretary-General\u2019s report. \nThe United Nations has a clear responsibility to \nacknowledge and address the consequences of nuclear \ntesting undertaken under its watch \u2014 and a special \nresponsibility has already been acknowledged by the \nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons. \n Last year, the General Assembly requested the \nSecretary-General to report on the effects of atomic \nradiation in the Marshall Islands. Such a report would \nrepresent the potential for the Marshall Islands, the \nUnited States and the United Nations to take a very \npositive step forward towards understanding our past, \nbringing closure to this sad chapter in our history and \nbeginning to understand how the international \ncommunity can assist us in addressing future \nremediation challenges. The involvement of the United \nNations is key. \n Sadly, I am concerned that the Secretary-General \nhas thus far neglected this critical opportunity. The \nUnited Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of \nAtomic Radiation, which was invited to contribute to \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to assemble a report, \nhas termed the General Assembly\u2019s deliberate mandate \nto be \u201cnot appropriate\u201d and \u201can apparent error\u201d in need \nof formal correction (A/66/46, para. 13). \n That is not only insensitive but it reveals that \nperhaps the United Nations itself has yet to come to \nterms with, or even to merely acknowledge, its \ndecisions on nuclear safety taken 60 years ago. That \nnegative approach could preclude efforts to bring to the \nattention of this body important scientific work that has \nbeen done in assessing the consequences of the nuclear \ntesting in the Marshall Islands. \n It is our hope that United Nations will have the \ncourage and will to rise above the past and make a \ndifference, rather than allow itself to remain controlled \nby history, and make excuses. As I said earlier, for \ndecades, Marshallese leaders have returned to the \nUnited Nations to repeatedly speak of the legacy of the \nnuclear testing in our country. It is my hope that one \nday a new generation of Marshallese leaders will come \nto this forum not to speak of this sad legacy, but rather \nto proclaim that the work is done and that all is well. \n The impacts of nuclear testing are not the only \nhistorical legacy from international actors in the \nMarshall Islands. Unexploded ordnance from the \nSecond World War and oil leakage are persistent issues \nfor our outer island communities. They pose threats to \nour human security, public health and environmental \nsafety. We welcome the attention of Pacific Island \nForum leaders, and we join the call for assistance from \ninternational bodies and development partners. \n The Republic of the Marshall Islands is not just a \nsmall island State; we are a large ocean nation. \n  \n \n11-51398 14 \n \nTogether, the oceanscape of the Pacific islands is an \narea that covers 10 per cent of the world\u2019s surface and \nis four times the size of Europe. The way we manage \nour maritime space is therefore a central pillar in our \nbasic development aspirations, and has significant \nimplications for the health of global oceans. \n International commitments to ensure sustainable \nfisheries and to visibly advance our development \naspirations can no longer be paid mere lip service and \nthen later be ignored by our partners in regional \nprocesses, including the Western and Central Pacific \nFisheries Commission. The Marshall Islands presently \nonly sees a penny of benefit for every dollar of the \nmarket value of our Pacific tuna. The conservation \nmeasures by the parties to the Nauru Agreement, \nincluding the Vessel Day Scheme and high seas \nclosures, must be implemented by our partners, not \nonly to reduce pressure on overfished stocks but also to \nensure our rightful place as a full economic actor. \n Twenty years ago, global leaders meeting at Rio \nde Janeiro set forward a high international benchmark \nfor sustainable development, crafting a range of \nstrategies and commitments. Next year, the critical \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment must not only focus on moving towards a \nglobal green economy but must also pay specific \nattention to a global \u201cblue economy\u201d \u2014 one that \nensures specific, measurable and time-bound targets \nfor guaranteeing the sustainability of the global oceans \nand their fish stocks, particularly in regions dotted by \nsmall island States like my own. Greater commitment \nis needed to utilize targeted global high seas closures, \nthereby ensuring sustainable fisheries, as we are \nalready doing in the Pacific. The hour is past for vague \nrhetoric. Leaders must respond with action rather than \ncontinued neglect for the world\u2019s oceans. \n The Marshall Islands warmly welcomed the visit \nthis month by the Secretary-General to the Pacific \nregion. The Secretary-General was able to see for \nhimself the vulnerability and existential threat facing \nlow-lying island States. He has now rightfully \nchallenged world leaders to respond. What were once \ntheoretical and distant risks are now on the verge of \nbecoming our reality. \n International climate negotiations are at serious \nrisk of entering a phase of political stalemate. \nNegotiators have spent more than two decades in \ncomplicated processes that have delivered very little in \nterms of practical action to mitigate the climate change \nproblem. Often blocked by only a handful of countries, \nthe international community is still unable to commit \nto emissions cuts and targets sufficient to ensure the \nsurvival of the Marshall Islands and other low-lying \nnations. \n The Marshall Islands can wait no longer. We are \nnow choosing creative paths to drive urgency into our \nbroken negotiations and to pursue practical initiatives \nto address the threats and risks. First, the Marshall \nIslands joined with the Government of Mexico in \nurging the United Nations in its coming Climate \nChange Conference to consider the use of voting as a \nmeans of last resort. Secondly, in July, we joined with \nour Pacific small island developing States colleagues to \npush for the Security Council to recognize that climate \nchange now poses an incontrovertible threat to \ninternational peace and security.  \n We reiterate our call for the Secretary-General to \nreport on those threats. Petty arguments about forums \nand mandates cannot be allowed to prevail at the risk \nof our statehood. All organs of the United Nations must \nnow be proactively engaged. We do not need \nsympathy; we need solutions and political innovation. \n Thirdly, the Marshall Islands is carefully studying \noptions for clarifying the relevant international \nobligations related to climate change and how it affects \nour statehood. Working with our close neighbour, the \nRepublic of Palau, we are committed to pursuing \nrequests for legal advisory opinions from international \ntribunals in order to recognize the international legal \nprinciples that address questions of our survival and \nsecurity in the context of climate risks. We have also \nagreed to work with Palau and other vulnerable and \nlow-lying countries to formulate and advance our own \nlegally binding climate agreement. We, the most \nvulnerable, must act when others lack the political will \nto do so.  \n As a significant global economic leader, Taiwan \ncan make substantial contributions to the international \ncommunity. The Republic of the Marshall Islands \nwelcomes increased dialogue on key cross-Strait \nissues. That progress deserves recognition by the \ninternational community. Given that the primary \npurpose of the United Nations is to maintain \ninternational peace, the world cannot afford to \noverlook Taiwan\u2019s strong efforts in promoting peace \n \n \n15 11-51398 \n \nand stability in the Asia-Pacific region, including with \nregard to climate change. \n The 2009 invitation by the World Health \nOrganization for Taiwan to participate as an observer \nhas not only benefited global medical progress, \nincluding on non-communicable diseases, but also \nserves as an effective model for its wider participation \nin other key organizations. We urge the United Nations \nand its Member States to consider that model and \ndevelop effective means for Taiwan\u2019s participation in \nspecialized agencies, including the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization. \n The Security Council must transform itself into \nan effective and contemporary body. The Security \nCouncil should be restructured to accommodate those \nnations whose size, leadership and responsibility, in \nparticular the Group of Four \u2014 Japan, Germany, India \nand Brazil \u2014 warrants a permanent presence in the \nCouncil. Further efforts should be made to ensure that \nAfrica and small nations, including island States, have \nimproved access and an amplified voice. \n The General Assembly witnessed a historic \nmoment last week, in which, for the first time, the \ngeneral debate was initiated by a woman, namely, \nPresident Rousseff of Brazil. The Marshall Islands \nwelcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s renewed priority on \naddressing gender, including a strengthened \nUN-Women institution, particularly in the Pacific. \n The message for nuclear weapons, global security \nand climate change is the same: international law is not \nan empty promise."

        "file_text": "It \nis a great pleasure for me to extend to Mr. Al-Nasser \nmy sincere congratulations on his election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His \nelection reflects the esteem enjoyed by the brotherly \nState of Qatar and the Arab world as a whole. We are \n \n \n45 11-51384 \n \nconfident that his rich diplomatic experience will \nensure a successful session. I also take this opportunity \nto pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for \nhis successful efforts throughout his presidency.  \n We also reiterate our congratulations to Mr. Ban \nKi-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. \nWe highly value the initiatives undertaken during his \nfirst mandate, in particular the establishment of \nUN-Women. I also reiterate our strong support for the \npriorities set by the Secretary-General for his second \nterm.  \n This session is taking place in a sensitive \ninternational context. The world is facing acute and \ncomplex crises, some of which are structural and \npersistent, including climate change and the food \ncrisis, while others are circumstantial, such as the \nunprecedented financial crisis and devastating nuclear \naccidents. Yet others, too, have had profound impacts, \nsuch as the financial crisis that became a global \neconomic crisis with destabilizing social and political \nconsequences. A decade after the horrific events of \n9/11, there is also the continued threat of international \nterrorism with its growing links to transnational \norganized crime in all its aspects. In addition, national \nand international tensions and armed conflict persist. \n Such a critical situation has rarely been witnessed \nby the world. We are therefore called upon to reflect \nobjectively on the following questions: What type of \nUnited Nations do we want in the face of these issues \nand challenges? How can we ensure that the United \nNations will serve as an influential and efficient legal \nand political framework for the collective management \nof global affairs? How can we ensure the effectiveness \nof the Organization\u2019s bodies and organs in adapting to \nthe fast-changing world? And finally, how do we \nconfirm the role of the Organization as the principal \naxis of a multilateral system based on solidarity and \ncoordination with new international groupings of \nlimited membership that are endowed with the ability \nto promptly respond to new events?  \n These questions are not based on an idealistic \napproach but emanate from our deep belief in the \nhighly important and unique role of the United Nations \nas a framework and reference for efficient and just \nglobal governance, based on solidarity, and which \ndraws its legitimacy from its global membership and \nthe capital it has accumulated since its establishment. \n To be effective, global governance must serve as \nthe natural extension of national, regional and \nsubregional governance. All Member States should \nshoulder their responsibilities in adopting appropriate \nmeasures and actions at the national level so as to lay \nthe foundation for and consolidate good governance. \n On that basis, the Kingdom of Morocco opted \nseveral decades ago to establish a democratic State \nbased on good governance, guaranteed individual \nfreedoms, the dignity of its citizens and respect for \nhuman rights, while upholding the principles of \nequality, equal opportunity and social justice, as well \nas the struggle against marginalization and social \nexclusion. The Kingdom, through the insightful vision \nof His Majesty King Mohammed VI, has also based the \nestablishment of a democratic and advanced society on \ntwo interdependent pillars: strengthened political \nreform and the realization of human development. \n The recent adoption of the Kingdom\u2019s new \nConstitution was an historic landmark in this \ndistinctive process and highlighted the cohesion among \nall components of the Moroccan nation with its \nmultiple branches. It consolidates the principles of the \nseparation and balance of powers while preserving the \nfull independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. \nIt also defines the rights and duties of citizenship and \nlays the foundations for political and economic \ngovernance through regulatory, mediation, \nrepresentation and accountability institutions. It also \nstrengthens women\u2019s participation in politics and social \nand economic development. In that context, broad \nregionalization enjoys a central role in the innovative \nconstitutional architecture. It serves as the backbone of \ncommunity democracy aimed at achieving \ndevelopment based on balance and solidarity among all \nregions of the Kingdom. \n The Arab world is witnessing profound events \nand transformations that, on the one hand, highlight \nlegitimate aspirations to freedom, dignity, progress and \nuniversal values that are shared by all regions, cultures \nand religions. Those events also show, on the other \nhand, that social and economic development cannot be \nachieved without political transparency and the \nevolution of democracy for the benefit of individuals \nand communities. There can be neither progress nor \nstability in the context of political stagnation, \nideological closure, the erosion of legitimacy and the \nabsence of any renewed or peaceful transfer of political \npower. \n  \n \n11-51384 46 \n \n Lastly, those events have also shown that each \nArab country has the capacity to build a political \nsystem that reconciles universal values and national \nspecificities, and that combines necessary openness \nand the preservation of cultural and civilizational \nidentity. In that regard, Morocco welcomes the \ninstitutional progress made by Tunisia and Egypt and \ncalls on the international community to support the \nefforts of those two brotherly peoples on the complex, \npromising and sensitive path of democratic transition. \n Morocco also expresses welcomes the delegation \nof the National Transitional Council of the new Libya, \nwhich aspires to a better future based on transparency, \nreconciliation and consolidation of the rule of law. In \nlight of the solidarity and brotherly links between the \npeoples of Morocco and Libya, Morocco has from the \nvery beginning supported the legitimate aspirations of \nthe Libyan people and the actions of the National \nTransitional Council at the national and international \nlevels. \n Morocco is also confident that Libya will regain \nits natural international position within the Maghreb \ncountries. Moreover, Morocco hopes to see concerted \nArab action to prevent further bloodshed and guarantee \npeaceful resolution of the crises in brotherly Syria and \nYemen through the announced profound, substantive \nreforms and based on territorial integrity and ensured \nstability. \n Those aspirations and changes reflect the free \nwill of the peoples and require the effective and serious \nsupport of their Arab brothers and partners, in full \nrespect for their national specificities, while taking into \naccount each country\u2019s progress in the democratization \nprocess. In that context, Morocco highly appreciates \nthe Group of Eight\u2019s response through the Deauville \npartnership.  \n Morocco believes that, in addition to its financial \nsupport, that promising partnership will act as an \nincentive by encouraging the five Arab beneficiary \ncountries to rely on their own capacities to enhance \neconomic integration, on the one hand, and to share \ngood experiences and best practices in the field of \ndemocratization and constitutional reforms, on the \nother. Morocco is willing to work with its brothers in \nthis framework based on the progress it has made in \npolitical openness and its experience in the field of \ndemocratic transition and distinctive constitutional \nreform.  \n The events and challenges in the Arab world also \nhighlight the need for renewed regional governance \nbased on the effective integration of harmonious and \ncoordinated groupings, such as the Maghreb Arab \nUnion, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Agadir \nAgreement for the Establishment of a Free Trade Zone \nbetween the Arabic Mediterranean Nations. The latter \ncould be enlarged to include other Arab and \nMediterranean countries and could extend its activities \nto areas of democratic reform and political dialogue. \nThis new governance seeks, under the aegis of the Arab \nLeague, to create a new regional Arab order with \ninnovative mechanisms and renewed foundations, to \nserve human development, economic integration and \ndemocratic openness, and to prevent conflicts and the \ndanger of separatism. \n It is clear that a final settlement to the Palestinian \nissue is a necessary factor in accelerating the pace of \nthe ongoing Arab endeavour in the interests of all \npeoples of the region. The question of Palestine is \ntoday at a historical turning point. It is characterized by \nthe absence of any prospect of negotiation, the ongoing \nsettlement programmes, and the Israeli policy of \ndetention, annexation, destruction and displacement, \nparticularly in Jerusalem, as well as collective \npunishment and the disproportionate use of force \nagainst civilians, as reported by the United Nations in \nthe report on the freedom flotilla. \n Due to the rejection by the Israeli Government of \nconstructive international initiatives and proposals by \nthe sponsors of the peace process, the situation has \ndeteriorated, and prospects have faded for the relaunch \nof a serious and genuine negotiating process on the \nfinal settlement, in step with reciprocal commitments. \nIt is time for the United Nations, through its various \norgans and using all available mechanisms, to shoulder \nits full responsibility by enabling the Palestinian \npeople, under the leadership of its National Authority, \nto achieve all its legitimate national rights, in harmony \nwith efforts to strengthen the foundation of an \nindependent Palestinian State and taking into account \nthe momentum of international support and \nrecognition.  \n Morocco has always been the first to defend the \nchoice of peace and the brotherly Palestinian people in \nits struggle, and today it cautions against the stalemate \nin the peace process, its underlying dangers and the \nprevalence of the logic of force. It reiterates its support \nfor the request of the Palestinian Authority, in the \n \n \n47 11-51384 \n \nperson of President Mahmoud Abbas, for Palestine to \nbecome a full Member of the United Nations as a \nsovereign State on the basis of the 1967 borders, with \nEast Jerusalem as its capital. Morocco, under the \nleadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, \nChairman of the Al-Quds Committee of the \nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation, will spare no \neffort in contributing to all constructive initiatives and \nsupporting all actions towards the realization of that \ngoal as soon as possible.  \n Moreover, our collective goal should be the \nrevival of the peace process on the basis of clear terms \nof reference, a comprehensive agenda, a precise time \nframe, an innovative negotiating methodology, and the \neffective and strong involvement of the Quartet. In that \nregard, the Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the \npositive signals in the recent statement made by the \nQuartet.  \n Consistent with its vision of solidarity and \nintegration in the Arab region, Morocco is engaged in \nbroad consultations with the members of the Gulf \nCooperation Council with a view to establishing an \nadvanced and substantive partnership in various \nstrategic, political, economic, social, human and \nsecurity fields. Morocco, which has strong ties with all \nmembers of that important regional group, wishes to \nestablish a new model of concrete and distinctive \npartnership that would contribute broadly to \nsustainable development, stability and the containment \nof the threats to the security, territorial integrity and \nhigh interests of our countries. In that context, \nMorocco reiterates its support for the legitimate rights \nof the United Arab Emirates with regard to its three \noccupied islands. \n Morocco\u2019s Maghreb, Arab, Islamic, \nMediterranean and African dimensions, as well as its \ncommitment to strengthening South-South cooperation, \nas enshrined in its new Constitution, contribute to the \ndiversity of the issues on which Moroccan foreign \npolicy is based, consistent with its aspirations to \nestablish regional governance founded on consultation, \ndialogue and solidarity. Recent reforms undertaken in \nthe Maghreb countries could give new impetus to \nMaghreb integration, consistent with the aspirations of \nthe five peoples of the region and their efforts to \nachieve development and stability. \n In that context, Morocco has worked relentlessly \nto activate bilateral relations with brotherly Algeria \nthrough ministerial visits, which it hopes will pave the \nway towards a comprehensive normalization between \nthe two countries, including the reopening of land \nborders in accordance with the principle of \nconstructive good-neighbourliness.  \n Inspired by the same will, Morocco reiterates its \nfull commitment to pursuing and intensifying the \nnegotiations to find a mutually acceptable political \nsolution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan \nSahara, on the basis of the Moroccan autonomy \ninitiative that the Security Council, through six \nsuccessive resolutions, has deemed to be serious and \ncredible. This bold and realistic initiative takes into \nconsideration, within the framework of the Kingdom\u2019s \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty, standards of \ninternational legitimacy that go beyond unilateral \nrestrictive interpretations that can only aggravate the \nstatus quo and lead to deadlock. \n Security Council resolution 1979 (2011) renewed \nthe emphasis on the fundamental guidelines of the \nnegotiating process by calling for all parties to enter \ninto substantive and serious negotiations and to show \nrealism and a spirit of compromise to reach a midway \nsolution, while urging neighbouring countries to fully \nengage in the process of negotiations. It is high time \nfor each party to shoulder its responsibilities, \nparticularly in the light of the events taking place in the \nregion, with a view to working seriously and in good \nfaith to reach a final political compromise solution to \nthis fabricated regional dispute. There is also an urgent \nneed to meet the aspirations of our brothers in the \ncamps in Tindouf, Algeria, where they are denied their \nmost basic human rights and any hope for the future. \n From this rostrum, I reiterate the persistent need \nto achieve effective Maghreb integration in the context \nof the Arab Maghreb Union as an open, complementary \nand democratic framework to serve the interests of the \npeoples of the five countries \u2014 the Greater Maghreb. \nSuch integration should contribute in an effective and \ninnovative manner to the present dynamic in the Arab \nworld. The Arab Maghreb should actively contribute to \nEuro-Mediterranean cooperation, in particular in the \ncontext of the Union for the Mediterranean, and to \ndevelopment and stability in the Sahelo-Saharan \nregion. It should be in the position to overcome \nterrorist threats and the related dangers of transnational \norganized criminal networks. \n  \n \n11-51384 48 \n \n King Mohammed VI made Africa the top priority \nof Moroccan foreign policy in October, promoting \ncooperation and solidarity in order to meet political, \nsocial, economic and security challenges hampering \ncomprehensive development in the continent. With the \nsame commitment, Morocco has contributed positively \nto international and regional efforts to settle several \nconflicts, including through its early and ongoing \nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. In Africa, in particular, Morocco has \nactively supported transitional democratic processes in \nGuinea, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Niger, among others.  \n Convinced of the need to develop and strengthen \na common coordination and negotiation mechanism \namong African countries, Morocco has worked in \ncooperation with its African brothers to launch the \nMinisterial Conference of African Atlantic States with \nthe aim of optimizing cooperation opportunities under \nthat common mechanism to overcome common \nchallenges, in particular those related to security and \nenvironment. \n There is no doubt that achieving the goal of \nsustainable development in developing countries, \nparticularly in Africa, remains a daunting challenge, \ngiven the persistent gap between international \ndevelopment assistance and the heavy debt burden of \ndeveloping nations. In that context, we support the \nsmall and island countries of the Caribbean Sea and the \nPacific and Indian Oceans in their efforts under the \nMauritius Strategy.  \n With that clear vision and constructive \napproaches reflecting the balance between domestic \nand foreign policy priorities, the Kingdom of Morocco \ncalls on the States members of the General Assembly to \nsupport its candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the \nSecurity Council for the biennium 2012-2013, in \naccordance with the rotation principle of the African \nGroup. That bid reflects Morocco\u2019s aspirations to serve \npeace and stability, strengthen solidarity and uphold \nuniversal ideals. Above all, it serves the goal of \nmaintaining international peace and security as a clear \nconstitutional commitment of the Kingdom. It \nenshrines our more than 50 years of pioneering \nexperience, during which more than 50,000 Moroccan \npeacekeepers have served in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations worldwide.  \n In that context, Morocco is participating actively \nin the work of the Peacebuilding Commission, which is \nan effective instrument to promote international \nsolidarity with countries emerging from conflict and \nthose starting a peacebuilding and national \nreconciliation process. In that spirit and to strengthen \nits partners for peace, Morocco is deeply and \ntransparently committed to implementing its \ninternational obligations on disarmament and the \nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \n Its candidacy will support enhanced solidarity \namong developing countries through South-South \ncooperation and the creation of mechanisms based on a \nnew vision that will include humanitarian assistance to \nconfront natural disasters and the food crisis, \nparticularly in sub-Saharan African countries, as well \nas the Caribbean and Pacific island States. Financial \nand technical assistance will be provided to the \neconomic and social sectors, including agriculture, \nhealth care, water and electricity. We currently host \nmore than 9,000 students from 42 countries, among \nwhom 8,000 have been granted Moroccan scholarships. \n Finally, Morocco\u2019s candidacy represents the \npromotion of universal values. Thanks to its diversity \nand openness, the Kingdom of Morocco has always \nserved as a crossroads of civilizations \u2014 a land of \npeace, tolerance and coexistence among cultures and \nreligions. Moreover, given its true commitment to the \nuniversal values of human rights, the Kingdom has \ntaken several initiatives aimed at strengthening the \nculture of human rights. It also played a an important \npart in establishing the Human Rights Council review \nmechanisms, given its leading role in that United \nNations body.  \n We are truly confident that the support of the \nmembers of the Assembly for the Moroccan candidacy, \nwhich represents a specific regional context, will \nprovide the Kingdom, during its mandate in the \nSecurity Council, with the distinct opportunity to \naddress, in a constructive and balanced manner, the \nsensitive matters on the Council\u2019s agenda involving \nArab and African issues.

        "file_text": "It is my great honour to \naddress the General Assembly today in my capacity as \nthe Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. Allow me, at the very outset, to \ncongratulate Mr. Al-Nasser upon his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession, as well as the members of the Bureau, and to \nexpress our full support for your future work. \nFurthermore, I would like to congratulate Mr. Joseph \nDeiss on the results achieved when he presided over \nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, in a \nperiod when this body and the international community \nin general were facing an array of challenges stemming \nfrom current global issues. \n I am especially honoured to extend \ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, for his unanimous re-appointment as the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations. Over the past \nfive years, Mr. Ban has worked tirelessly to address the \nvarious issues facing the Organization. We expect that \nthe Secretary-General will continue to pursue these \nactivities during his second term. \n Allow me to express my gratitude for all the \ncooperation and the support we have received during \nBosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s membership in the Security \nCouncil, which will expire in a few months. Speaking \nof our membership in the Security Council, let me once \nagain reiterate the view that the presence and \nparticipation of small States such as Bosnia and \nHerzegovina in the work and decisions of the Security \nCouncil is particularly important for maintaining \nbalance within it. Accordingly, other countries, along \nwith the Security Council\u2019s permanent members and \nthe world Powers, also have the opportunity to express \ntheir views and participate in Security Council \ndecision-making on important issues of international \npeace and security. It has been our pleasure and honour \nto work together with all members of the Security \nCouncil during the term of our membership, \n2010-2011. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina had the honour to \npreside over the Security Council in January 2011. \nAlthough acting as President was only one segment of \nthe two-year experience in the Council, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina once again proved that it can be an equal \npartner on the international diplomatic scene and \nrespond to a variety of obligations.  \n Bosnia and Herzegovina has played a \nconstructive role in the work of the Security Council \nby contributing to the Council\u2019s better, more effective \nand faster response to situations with the potential to \n \n \n13 11-50702 \n \nthreaten international peace. Furthermore, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina has also sought to share its own \nexperiences in post-conflict peacebuilding and \ncontribute actively to better and long-lasting \nunderstanding and reconciliation. Through its role in \nthe Council, Bosnia and Herzegovina showed that it \ncan be an equal and competent partner in international \nrelations. \n The Security Council thematic debate (see \nS/PV.6472) entitled \u201cPost-conflict peacebuilding: \ninstitution-building\u201d, which was initiated by Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, reached a number of conclusions. I \nwould like to mention some of them. \n In the interests of the success of peacebuilding \ninitiatives, priority must be given to institution-\nbuilding. so as to prevent a return to conflict and \nensure the survival, renewed credibility and legitimacy \nof States. The purpose of institution-building is to \nprogressively reduce dependence on the international \ncommunity and promote sustainability. Ownership of \nthe reform process is the main condition for the \nestablishment of effective institutions and for ensuring \nsustainable peace. \n Success in post-conflict institution-building \ndepends primarily on establishing partnerships between \nthe international community and post-conflict \nsocieties, a partnership that is based on a set of \ncommon goals. Bearing that in mind, we would like \nonce again to thank the Assembly for the confidence its \nmembers have shown and for the support they have \nprovided during our membership in the Security \nCouncil.  \n Bosnia and Herzegovina also continues to \nprovide concrete contributions to the United Nations \npeace operations in Liberia, the Sudan, Cyprus and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \n In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are united in our \ndetermination to move towards full membership in the \nEuropean Union (EU); our unity provides a solid basis \nfor the achievement of this goal. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina places special emphasis \non regional and subregional cooperation and dialogue \nbetween neighbouring countries in the Balkans, with \ntheir different cultures and traditions that have been \npresent for centuries. We are committed to future \ncooperation with our neighbours, based on the \nprinciples of mutual respect and respect for sovereignty \nand territorial integrity. We are interested in sharing \nour experiences with others and in developing mutually \nbeneficial relations in post-conflict peacebuilding, \nbased on mutual respect for differences, which, in our \nopinion, represent an advantage. \n I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize \nthat the issues of neighbourly and regional cooperation \nare closely related to the integration of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina into the EU and NATO, which is a \nstrategic and high-priority foreign policy objective for \nmy country. We believe that this is the best and only \nway to ensure stability, security, economic \ndevelopment and prosperity for all citizens of Bosnia.  \n The strategic goal of establishing formal relations \nand EU membership is based on the aspiration of \nBosnia and Herzegovina to achieve the full functioning \nof our own institutions and the further development of \nsociety, on the basis of the principles of a free market, \nthe rule of law and, especially, the protection of human \nrights. \n Furthermore, my country wishes to improve its \nrelations with the States of Asia, Africa, Latin America, \nAustralia and the wider region, at the multilateral and \nbilateral level, in accordance with common interests \nand real possibilities. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains \ndedicated to the principle of openness in cooperation \nwith all countries of the world. \n Many important world events have occurred since \nthe previous session of the General Assembly. Bosnia \nand Herzegovina is following with great attention, \npreoccupation and concern the development of the \nsituation in the friendly Arab countries that are affected \nby deep social and political changes. Bosnia and \nHerzegovina supports democratic processes aimed at \nthe creation of free, democratic and prosperous \nsocieties. However, such processes are often followed \nby tragic consequences, and we therefore appeal once \nagain for the violence to stop and for peace to be \nachieved in those societies. \n We are deeply concerned by the standstill in \ncrisis resolution in the Middle East. Despite the \noptimistic announcements and plans made, the peace \nprocess has not yet been revived, as had been expected. \nThe only way forward is a solution that is based on the \nprinciple of the peaceful coexistence of two sovereign \nStates: a viable and independent Palestine and a stable \nand secure Israel, with respect for the provisions of \n  \n \n11-50702 14 \n \ninternational law and humanitarian law and human \nrights instruments. \n To date, the United Nations has supported and \nactively participated in the creation of a positive \natmosphere in order to reach a just, comprehensive and \nlasting peace in the Middle East. Bosnia and \nHerzegovina believes that the conditions for a lasting \nand just solution can be achieved with additional \npolitical will and responsibility on the part of the \nnegotiating parties. \n We are witnesses to the fact that the international \ncommunity\u2019s determination to deal with terrorism and, \nat the same time, create conditions conducive to the \npeaceful development of Afghanistan has yielded \nresults. However, we cannot but conclude that it will \ntake much greater efforts to establish self-sustaining \npeace and stability in Afghanistan. In April 2010, as a \nsign of support for the activities of the international \ncommunity, Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision \non the sending of an infantry unit to the International \nSecurity Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan. \n I would like to emphasize here that Bosnia and \nHerzegovina is still very concerned about terrorist \nattacks, which claim innocent civilian lives in many \ncountries around the world. Bearing in mind the fact \nthat the modern world continues to face various forms \nof international terrorism, I express our support for the \nfull implementation of the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and the activities of the \nCounter-Terrorism Committee. In that regard, let me \nreiterate that Bosnia and Herzegovina is \nunconditionally dedicated to the fight against terrorism \nand is particularly active in cooperating with the \ncountries of our region to increase security and \nenhance preparedness for the effective prevention of \nterrorist acts. Completing negotiations and adopting a \nUnited Nations comprehensive convention against \nterrorism would be an important contribution in this \nfield. \n In addition to the political crisis, this year we are \nfaced once again with many other problems to which \nthe international community still lacks proper and \neffective responses. Despite signs of recovery, the \ngreatest economic and financial crisis in recent history \nhas, unfortunately, left visible consequences that are \nhaving repercussions on global peace and security. It is \nclear that countries individually cannot cope with this \nissue, no matter how efficient their Governments may \nbe. Global crises require global solutions. \n In the context of the activities of the United \nNations, we must face the fact that the greatest \neconomic crisis since the foundation of the world \nOrganization has to some degree threatened and even \nbegun to bring into question the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals, one of the most \ncomprehensive strategic tasks set by the Organization \nsince its establishment. \n Therefore, it is necessary to do everything in our \npower, individually and collectively, in order to \nprevent any further erosion of this key strategic \nproject. We believe that it is necessary for the \ninternational community, especially the United \nNations, to redouble its efforts to assist primarily the \nleast developed countries. \n The climate change problem caused by human \nactivity is leading to changes in the environment that \ncould have catastrophic consequences for humankind \nas a whole if the process of reaching agreement on \nenvironmental protection is not intensified. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina shares the concern of the \nmost States Members of the United Nations at the fact \nthat drought, floods, sea-level rise, lack of running \nwater and food, deforestation and all the other \nphenomena caused by global warming pose a serious \nthreat to global security, which in future could be a \ncause of conflict throughout the world. The extremely \nimportant issue of climate change therefore requires \nurgent action by the international community. Bosnia \nand Herzegovina has expressed interest in joining the \ncountries that support the Copenhagen Accord; thus \nour country has joined the large number of States \nMembers of the United Nations that consider that \nAccord to be a necessary step in relation to Kyoto until \nthe achievement of a final, legally binding agreement. \n Bearing this in mind, I believe that neither \neconomic nor political interests should stand in the \nway of achieving a global consensus as the beginning \nof the global and common struggle to preserve the \nnatural balance of the planet. It is often forgotten that \nclimate change has a direct effect in terms of \ndevelopment, poverty and hunger, and, consequently, \nglobal peace and security. I am convinced that it is in \nour common interest to ensure that future generations \ninherit the best possible world on our common home, \nplanet Earth. \n \n \n15 11-50702 \n \n I hope that all of us who are here today agree that \ncomprehensive United Nations reform is necessary; \nsuch reform must be carried out with extreme care, \nwith the broadest possible consensus on the part of \nMember States. Bosnia and Herzegovina sees the role \nof the United Nations and its agencies as central to \nresolving key issues of international significance. \nTherefore, it supports the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts \nand proposals for reform. \n United Nations reform should lead to the efficient \nand coordinated functioning of all agencies and bodies \nof the United Nations system, bearing in mind the need \nto avoid any duplication of activities in the context of a \nmore rational allocation of financial resources. \n Regardless of the future configuration of the \nSecurity Council, we believe that the Eastern European \ngroup of countries must have another non-permanent \nseat, taking into account the fact that in the past two \ndecades the number of countries in this group has more \nthan doubled. \n While presiding over a subsidiary body of the \nSecurity Council \u2014 the Informal Working Group on \nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions \u2014 \nBosnia and Herzegovina set the consideration of the \nworking methods and transparency of the Security \nCouncil as a primary goal. Bosnia and Herzegovina \nalso organized several informal meetings in \ncooperation with partner countries and the General \nAssembly, at which States Members of the United \nNations expressed their opinions and views and put \nforward concrete proposals for improving the \nefficiency of the Security Council. \n I wish to emphasize in particular that it is \nexpected that the United Nations, particularly the \nSecurity Council, be more active in the area of \npreventive diplomacy. We believe that in order to make \nthe work of the Council more efficient, greater activity \nin this respect would provide a starting point for \nresolving many of the world\u2019s problems and crises \nbefore they flare up. Providing timely and effective \nconflict prevention, rather than reacting once the crisis \nhas escalated, is certainly a more efficient and less \nexpensive mechanism for preserving peace and \nsecurity. \n During the six decades of its existence, the \nUnited Nations has undergone ordeals but it always \nwas and still is the best framework for seeking and \nproviding adequate responses to the wide range of \nglobal issues that we face. Therefore, I urge Member \nStates to work for the full implementation of all our \nagreements in order to make the world a better place \nfor our future generations."

        "file_text": "At \nthe outset, let me say that it is my pleasure to \npersonally extend to you, Mr. President, on behalf of \nthe Government and the people of the State of Kuwait, \nmy most sincere congratulations on your unanimous \nelection as President of the sixty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Your election represents an \nacknowledgement and an appreciation of the prominent \nstature of the fraternal State of Qatar, which has strong \nand distinct links and relations with my country, \nKuwait. I am confident, Sir, that you will conduct the \nwork of this session in a manner conducive to ensuring \nits success. \n We also would like to pay tribute to the efforts of \nyour predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, on his outstanding \npresidency and his successful conduct of the work of \nthe previous session. \n We congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General \nand wish him continued success. \n We were pleased to see the accession by the State \nof South Sudan to the United Nations. Kuwait \nrecognized the State of South Sudan on the first day of \nits independence. We are confident that the \nGovernment and the brotherly people of South \nSudan \u2014 a people with whom we are proud to have a \nstrong relationship \u2014 will achieve security, stability \nand economic development for their country. \n There is no doubt that our Organization is \ngrowing more important by the day. Over the past six \ndecades, the international arena has been the scene of \nnumerous events and developments that have had a \ndirect impact on international peace and security. As \nthe most legitimate, credible and independent \nmultilateral international mechanism, the United \n  \n \n11-50865 22 \n \nNations has remained a safe haven for Member States \nseeking solutions to questions, problems and crises. \nThere is a general conviction that no one country \nalone, no matter how powerful and capable, can face \nthe dangers of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction, climate change, epidemics, \norganized crime or any challenges that do not respect \nor recognize geographic or national borders. \n Recently, the role of the United Nations has \nexpanded significantly. This is particularly true in \nconnection with the humanitarian disasters that we \nhave witnessed, whether man-made or natural. The \nlatest example was the famine affecting the Horn of \nAfrica as a result of drought and violence. The United \nNations has been able to mobilize humanitarian aid and \nto provide humanitarian assistance to those in need. \nThose actions have alleviated the suffering and saved \nthe lives of millions. \n The growing importance of the United Nations in \nour world today requires the improvement and \nstrengthening of its capabilities. We must enhance its \nperformance. This will require measures and steps to \nreform its major bodies, including the General \nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \nSocial Council, as well as develop their functions and \nresponsibilities to enable those bodies to carry them \nout efficiently and effectively. It is therefore incumbent \nupon all States Members of the United Nations to \nsupport the Organization, commit to implementing its \nresolutions and provide it with the needed financial \nresources, in a timely manner without any conditions. \nIn the final analysis, the power of the United Nations is \nbut a reflection of the support that Member States \nprovide in pursuance of its lofty objectives and the \nfulfilment of its needs. \n We have witnessed with great concern the \ndevelopments and events in the Middle East region, \nsuch as will lead to more deterioration in its security \nand stability. The use of force and the acts of violence \nthat have claimed the lives of thousands must cease so \nas to prevent further bloodshed. The legitimate \ndemands of peoples for the implementation of serious \nand prompt political, economic and social reforms \nmust be heeded. In that respect, the State of Kuwait \nsupports all efforts calling for dialogue, understanding \nand the rejection of violence. \n The State of Kuwait attaches great importance to \nconsolidating and developing its relations with its \nneighbours on firm and solid grounds, based on mutual \nrespect and common interests, as well as to promoting \nthese relations to a level that meets the aspirations of \nthe peoples of the region. In this context, the State of \nKuwait supports the calls made on the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran to take serious and genuine \nconfidence-building measures, to abide by the \nresolutions of international legitimacy, to cooperate \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency so as to \ndispel fears and doubts surrounding its nuclear \nprogrammes, and to cooperate positively in resolving \nthe dispute over the occupied Emirati islands according \nto the principles and rules of international law. \n This year, the State of Kuwait celebrated the \nfiftieth anniversary of its independence and the \ntwentieth anniversary of its liberation from the Iraqi \nSaddami occupation. That liberation was truly \nconsidered one of the most salient successes of the \nUnited Nations in its efforts to deter aggression and \neliminate its effects, based on the principles of the \nCharter and the resolutions of international legitimacy. \n In November, Kuwait will also celebrate the \nfiftieth anniversary of its Constitution, which codified \nthe democracy that has become an integral part of the \nState of Kuwait since its establishment. That is \nconsidered one of the most outstanding achievements \nof the people and Government of Kuwait. Those are all \nhistoric occasions for a small peace-loving country that \nbelieves in the principles and purposes of the United \nNations Charter and international law.  \n Our country relies in its relations with other \nStates on respect for the principles of sovereignty, \nindependence and non-interference in the internal \naffairs of others, as well as the settlement of all \ndisputes by peaceful means. The State of Kuwait also \nseeks to overcome its painful memories by establishing \nstrong relations of cooperation, mutual respect and \ngood-neighbourliness with the brotherly Republic of \nIraq. We deeply hope that development and stability \nwill prevail there, and that further progress will be \nachieved in Iraq\u2019s efforts to enforce security and \nrebuild the economy, which was destroyed by the \nformer regime\u2019s aggressive and expansionist policies. \nWe reaffirm our commitment to providing all forms of \nsupport to help Iraq implement its remaining \ninternational obligations under the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions and regain its role in the regional \nand international sphere. \n \n \n23 11-50865 \n \n More than six decades have elapsed and the \nUnited Nations remains incapable of finding a solution \nto the Palestinian question and of putting an end to the \nIsraeli occupation of Arab territories. Worse, the \nsuffering of the Palestinian people only increases with \nthe years. Their economic and social conditions \nworsen, settlements expand, their lands are confiscated, \ntheir water is stolen, their homes and land are besieged, \ntheir movements are restricted and their sons and \ndaughters are imprisoned. Most troubling of all is that \nthe international community stands idly by, a passive \nspectator to Israel\u2019s unchanging practices and policies, \ndespite the fact that those policies not only violate the \nmost rudimentary rules of international law and \nresolutions of international legitimacy, but undermine \nany chance to achieve peace.  \n Israel\u2019s inhumane practices against our brothers \nin Gaza \u2014 such as the totally unjustified blockade and \nthe deliberate destruction of infrastructure, despite \ncontinued international condemnation, to name but \ntwo \u2014 are a glaring example of Israel\u2019s indifference to \nits obligations and world public opinion. The \ninternational community is therefore called upon to \npursue its efforts to bring pressure to bear on Israel so \nthat the Palestinian people enjoy their right to self-\ndetermination.  \n The Palestinian State must be established, with \nEast Jerusalem as its capital, and the Israeli occupation \nof all the Arab territories it has occupied since 4 June \n1967, including the Syrian Golan, must end. Israel \nmust also cease its continued violations of the \nsovereignty of Lebanon and withdraw from all its \noccupied territories. We wish to renew once again our \nfull commitment and support to the bid and endeavours \nof the Palestinian Authority to obtain membership in \nthe United Nations as an independent, sovereign and \nfull Member State. \n The State of Kuwait welcomes the international \nreports issued by the United Nations and its agencies \nconcerning the Millennium Development Goals \nadopted at the 2000 Millennium Summit and the status \nof their achievement. We can all be proud of the \naccomplishments in reducing the number of persons \ninfected with HIV/AIDS and providing medication to \ngreater numbers of infected people, as well as progress \nin fighting other communicable diseases, such as \nmalaria and tuberculosis. However, despite those \naccomplishments, much remains to be done, since \nthese accomplishments are unevenly distributed among \nStates. Many indicators confirm that some States will \nnot be able to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015.  \n That could be attributed to a number of causes, \nthe most obvious of which is the ongoing global \neconomic and financial crisis and its negative impact \non the majority of States, large and small, rich and \npoor. However, developing countries, especially the \nleast developed, have suffered most because of the \nweakness and vulnerability of their economies. Their \neconomic growth has faltered and the volume of their \nexports fallen, while unemployment rates have risen. \nAt the same time, the prices of food and basic \ncommodities have risen, exacerbating the economic \nand social impact of the crisis.  \n No sooner had the world started to recover from \nthe economic crisis than the symptoms of another \nbegan to emerge, threatening once again the growth of \nthe global economy. That new crisis is exemplified in \nthe sovereign debt of the United States and a number of \nEuropean countries. The international community must \nforge ahead in restructuring the international financial \ninstitutions in order to ensure their sustainability, \nimprove their ability to perform their duties effectively \nand efficiently, and make them more representative of \nand fair to the countries that need their support. \n The world today is in dire need of a just, fair and \nbalanced global trading system that bridges the \nenormous gap between States, ensures mutual benefit \nand assists in integrating the economies of poor \ncountries into the global economic system. Developed \ncountries must also fulfil their commitments and \nincrease their official development assistance to the \nlevel of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product, as \nagreed internationally. \n In that context, the State of Kuwait will spare no \neffort to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to \nStates stricken by natural disasters or to respond to \nappeals by the United Nations or its agencies to \nalleviate the suffering of the peoples of such States. We \nbelieve in the importance of the role of the United \nNations in the field of humanitarian assistance, and the \nState of Kuwait has therefore increased its voluntary \ncontributions to a number of international \norganizations and specialized agencies, such as the \nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \nRefugees, the United Nations Central Emergency \n  \n \n11-50865 24 \n \nResponse Fund and the International Committee of the \nRed Cross.  \n Although the State of Kuwait is a developing \ncountry, since its independence in 1961 it has followed \na special policy in support of developing countries and \nleast developed countries by extending a helping hand \nand providing humanitarian and development \nassistance when and as needed. More than 100 \ncountries throughout the world have benefited from \nthat assistance, which exceeds $15 billion. \n The Emir of the State of Kuwait has launched \nseveral initiatives, including the decent living \ninitiative, the initiative to support and encourage small \nand medium-size projects, and the initiative to develop \nand rebuild eastern Sudan, with a view to alleviating \nthe suffering in many countries affected by the increase \nin the prices of food and energy, as well as those whose \neconomies have been affected by the global financial \ncrisis and have witnessed increased unemployment and \npoverty. Many countries have benefited from those \ninitiatives. \n The United Nations has convened numerous \ninternational conferences and adopted many \nresolutions, agreements and statements. It has united \nour visions, guided our endeavours and mobilized our \nresources and our potential so as to consolidate our \ncommon work to combat corruption, strengthen the \nrule of law and good governance, ensure respect for \nhuman rights, and empower women and bolster their \nrole in society, inter alia.  \n We look forward to a more effective international \nrole within the context of the Alliance of Civilizations \ninitiative, in order to intensify dialogue between \nvarious civilizations, religions and cultures; \ndisseminate the values of tolerance, moderation and \nmutual respect; and reject any expression of violence \nor extremism, which undermine our potential to work \ntogether to spread the culture of peace and abide by the \nlofty purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter \nof our Organization.

        "file_text": "It is truly an honour \nfor me to address the Assembly at this global forum on \nbehalf of Montenegro and to reiterate our commitment \nto the principles and purposes of the United Nations \nand its Charter. \n I hereby wish to congratulate Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to \npledge the full support of the Montenegrin delegation \nas he carries out his demanding task. I also wish to \nthank Mr. Joseph Deiss for his valuable contribution \nand for strengthening the central role of the United \nNations in the global system during his presidency of \nthe General Assembly. \n I would like to congratulate Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon on his reappointment, which I am certain \nwill result in the continuation of the reforms \nundertaken to build a more efficient and coherent \nUnited Nations system, and thus a safer and more \nprosperous world. \n Two months ago, Montenegro was replaced by \nSouth Sudan as the youngest Member of our \nOrganization. I wish to congratulate South Sudan on its \nindependence and its full-fledged membership in this \nbody. I truly believe that this milestone will contribute \nto security and serve as a good starting point for the \ndevelopment of good-neighbourly relations. \n We also support the democratization processes in \nNorth Africa, as well as the actions taken by the United \nNations and the African Union in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, \nSomalia, the Congo and other parts of Africa to further \nthe overall progress of the entire continent. \n In the context of regional cooperation, \nMontenegro has contributed to overall stability in \nSouth-East Europe by chairing the most important \nregional initiatives, which has been a unique and rather \nchallenging experience for our Administration. \nMontenegro is committed to further developing mutual \nunderstanding and to strengthening all forms of \ncooperation in the future. Our success and that of the \ncountries of our region is the success of Europe, too. \n There is full consensus on the issue of European \nUnion integration in Montenegro. We are aware of the \nfact that this process requires continuous contributions \nfrom all stakeholders in our society. I am convinced \nthat we will have enough will, enthusiasm, capacity \nand energy to tackle it during the forthcoming period. \n I hope and believe that persistent and committed \nwork on the implementation of overall internal \nreforms, based on the seven key recommendations \nunderlined by the European Commission and \naccompanied by a policy of good-neighbourly relations \nand regional and international cooperation, represent a \nsolid foundation for the European Commission to \nrecommend, in its progress report to the European \nCouncil, that European Union (EU) accession talks be \nopened with Montenegro. \n We are taking firm steps forward on the \nEuro-Atlantic path and are currently preparing our \nsecond Annual National Programme as part of the \nNATO membership process. The progress of the \nWestern Balkan countries towards European and Euro-\nAtlantic integration is a key factor for regional stability \nand lays the groundwork for long-term economic \nprosperity. \n As a United Nations Member State and a reliable \ninternational partner, Montenegro is committed to the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nConsistent with its capacities, Montenegro actively \nparticipates in United Nations peacekeeping missions \nin Liberia and Cyprus, while also keeping in mind the \nregional security aspects. \n Through our participation in the NATO-led \nInternational Security Assistance Force, we directly \ncontribute to the efforts of the international community \nto ensure lasting peace in Afghanistan, while at the \nsame time supporting global efforts in the fight against \nterrorism. Through the EU ATALANTA mission, we \nhave joined the fight against piracy, the consequences \n \n \n5 11-51360 \n \nof which have also been suffered by Montenegrin \nsailors. \n Nevertheless, in order to prevent new conflicts \nthat have the potential to cause humanitarian disasters \nand put additional pressure on the already-burdened \npeacekeeping mission contingents, it is necessary to \nstrengthen preventive diplomacy and mediation \nactivities in cases of potential and initiated conflict. \nThe further development of United Nations capacities \nin this domain will contribute to the timely and \npeaceful resolution of conflicts before their \ncomplexities lead to serious international \nrepercussions. \n In that regard, Montenegro strongly supports the \npeaceful resolution of all existing conflicts, especially \nthose in the wider region of the Middle East and North \nAfrica. Priority should be given to the urgent signing \nof a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine, \nwhich is in their mutual interest. Only if both sides \nrefrain from violent actions will room be created for \nconfidence-building and a comprehensive solution to \nthe Middle East issue, making Israel a safe country, to \nthe benefit of both internationally recognized sides and \nmeeting the prerequisites for Palestine to establish a \nstable State.  \n Montenegro also supports all the Security \nCouncil resolutions and actions taken by the \ninternational community aimed at stopping human \nrights violations and fulfilling the legitimate \naspirations of populations, especially in Libya and \nSyria. \n Montenegro supports the principles of the \nuniversality of human rights and the inadmissibility of \nviolating them or resolutions promoting their \nprotection and enhancement. We also support the \nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \nand the Human Rights Council, to which we have \nannounced our candidature for the period 2013-2015. \nExperience that Montenegro gained in its turbulent \npast, when it provided shelter to refugees, can serve as \na basis for achieving long-lasting political \ncompromises aimed at securing peace in the region. In \nour view, the Universal Periodic Review is an \nimportant instrument for assessing the status of human \nrights in the world. \n I wish to emphasize our support of the work of \nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia, and the importance of all of the \ninternational tribunals, especially when it comes to \nsystematic violations of fundamental human rights and \nfreedoms. They not only serve as an example and guide \nfor national courts, but they also function as a clear \ndeterrent to and inescapable destination for individuals \nwho ignore the rules established by the Geneva \nConventions. \n Montenegro, as an ethnically, culturally and \nreligiously diverse society, is an active member of the \nGroup of Friends of the United Nations Alliance of \nCivilizations and is committed to the fundamental \nprinciples of integration, the strengthening of civil \nsociety, tolerance and the fight against all forms of \ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. We \nare determined and committed to preserving the \nfundamental values that civil society is based upon, no \nmatter what the challenges are and no matter what the \nchallenges that we, as a society and a State, will have \nto face in the future. \n Let me also briefly point out our current \neconomic developments. The fact that we are a small \nand open economy, and therefore vulnerable to changes \nin the global economic market, resulted in the global \neconomic and financial crisis stalling Montenegro\u2019s \neconomic progress. Nevertheless, with the \nimplementation of our anti-crisis economic policy we \nhave lessened the impact of the global crisis and \nstopped the downward trend in the Montenegrin \neconomy. \n That crisis confirmed the soundness of the basic \nprinciples of our economic policy \u2014 focusing on \nfurther stabilization of public finances, improving the \nbusiness environment and structural reforms, so as to \nestablish a stable, dynamic and competitive economy \nin the long term and to improve the quality of life of all \ncitizens of Montenegro. Despite being fully aware that, \nif we are to mount an adequate response to the crisis, \nwe will have to make some difficult and unpopular cuts \nin order to create a new, sound basis for strengthening \nthe economy, we also know that actions taken by one \nstakeholder alone, no matter how successful, are \ninsufficient. We all have to play a positive role in order \nto strike the right balance among success, \nsustainability, social responsibility and solidarity in \nthis complex process. \n Accordingly, we must not stop progress towards \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals, the \nrealization of which creates the basis for the further \n  \n \n11-51360 6 \n \ndevelopment of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms throughout the world. The fight against \npoverty and diseases, gender equality, protection of \nmothers and children, education, environmental \nprotection and sustainable development represent the \nmain prerequisites for progress and prosperity for our \nsocieties and are high on our Government\u2019s agenda. \n Montenegro supports pragmatic reform in the \nUnited Nations. As a small country, it is especially \ninterested in strengthening the authority and role of the \nGeneral Assembly \u2014 and other main United Nations \nbodies \u2014 and in improving its efficiency of operation. \nIncreasing representation in the Security Council \u2014 \nincluding granting a seat to the Group of Eastern \nEuropean States in the category of non-permanent \nmember \u2014 would result in a functional strengthening \nof that body, improving its efficiency, accountability \nand credibility, in accordance with the United Nations \nCharter. A modern reform process, open to Member \nStates individually or to groups of countries, must be \nbased on a broad consensus on all five key aspects of \nSecurity Council reform. I am sure that there is a way \nto make a bridge between those goals and other \nentities, such as the Group of 20, for instance. \n In its further democratization, its improved \nefficiency, its strengthened judiciary and administrative \nsystem, its fight against corruption and organized \ncrime and its fostering of an inclusive society, \nMontenegro and the resident and non-resident United \nNations agencies are working together to achieve the \nstrategic goals of our common policy. The United \nNations Development programme Resident \nRepresentative and the One United Nations programme \nhave given an opportunity both to United Nations \nagencies and State partners in the process to create and \nmonitor programme activities directly and on equal \nfooting, and to adapt programme activities to the \ndevelopment needs of our country. \n At the same time, the One United Nations \nprogramme is an opportunity for gradual reform in the \noperations of the United Nations system, creating a \nsimultaneous and well-coordinated approach that will \nresult, among other things, in avoiding overlaps \nbetween United Nations agencies and in achieving \nmore efficient results in the implementation of national \npriorities. \n Montenegro supports nuclear non-proliferation \nand objects to further expansion of the number of \ncountries that possess nuclear weapons. Moreover, we \nsupport all agreements of the nuclear Powers on mutual \nreduction of their nuclear capacities, creating a safer \nworld for existing and future generations. In that \ncontext, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for the \nappeal he sent late last month, requesting all countries \nthat have nuclear technology to adhere to the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. I wish to \nemphasize that Montenegro ratified the Convention on \nCluster Munitions and that within less than a year it \ndestroyed all reserves of that type of weapons, thus \nconfirming again its commitment to the principles of \nnon-proliferation. \n Montenegro is an environmentally conscious \nState. That is a bedrock principle of our Constitution. \nBased on that commitment, we have an additional \nincentive to find solutions that are compatible with our \nsustainable development policy. Our strategy for \ndevelopment in Montenegro is to achieve synergy \nbetween growth and employment, on the one hand, and \nsocial equality, the environment and natural resources, \non the other.  \n The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, which will take place in Rio de Janeiro \nin 2012, represents an important opportunity to \npromote international cooperation in the area of \nsustainable development and an opportunity to make a \ncomprehensive evaluation of the progress made in the \npast two decades. Montenegro, as a member of the \nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment from 2011 to 2014, is committed to \ncontributing to the success of that Conference with its \nconstructive actions. \n Montenegro is especially sensitive to climate \nchange issues. There are numerous potential negative \neffects of climate change on Montenegro. A rise in sea \nlevel and temperature would diminish biological \ndiversity. I therefore believe that the fight against \nclimate change requires a global, coordinated and \ndecisive international agreement, based on the \nprinciples defined in the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. \nThe Framework Convention represents a key \nmultilateral forum for global action in the area of \nclimate change, and the sixteenth Conference of the \nParties in Canc\u00fan confirms that a multilateral approach \nto climate change management under United Nations \nauspices can give concrete results. \n \n \n7 11-51360 \n \n Allow me to reiterate once again how honoured I \nam to participate in the general debate of this global \nforum on behalf of Montenegro and, together with the \nrepresentatives of 192 countries, to contribute directly \nto the promotion of our mutual understanding and \npeaceful coexistence, to the benefit of all of our \nnations."

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate the \nPresident and his country, Qatar, on his election to the \npresidency of the Assembly at this session. With his \nwisdom and experience, I am confident that he will \nsuccessfully steer the proceedings of the Assembly. I \nassure him of my delegation\u2019s cooperation and support. \nI also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon \non his reappointment as Secretary-General. \n I commend the President for choosing the role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans as the theme for this debate. The peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, as provided for in Chapter VI of \nthe United Nations Charter, is an important principle \nthat the international community should uphold in \nseeking solutions to conflicts throughout the world.  \n Our Government recognizes the legitimacy of \npeaceful demands for democratic changes in sister \ncountries such as Tunisia and Egypt. However, we \nbelieve that the demands for democratic change should \nbe locally driven. They should not be used as a pretext \nto undermine the fundamental principle of sovereignty \nand non-intervention in the internal affairs of \nindependent States.  \n We are concerned that all efforts by the African \nUnion to find a peaceful negotiated solution in Libya \nwere ignored and undermined. Never in the history of \nthe United Nations has the sanctity of the principle of \nnon-intervention been so compromised as we have \nwitnessed recently in Libya. The military intervention \nby a foreign Power reminds Africa of the infamous \nBerlin Conference of 1884, when Africa was carved up \nby imperial Powers. \n In the aftermath of the recent political changes in \nsome African countries, it is important to underscore \nthe need to promote genuine national reconciliation \nand unity and to begin urgently to address the \nchallenges of poverty and unemployment, especially \namong the youth of the world. Respect for justice, \nfundamental human rights, the rule of law and good \ngovernance should be preconditions for lasting peace.  \n Following successful negotiations, the Republic \nof South Sudan attained its independence on 9 July \n2011. This demonstrated the statesmanship and wisdom \nof the leaders of the Sudan and the Republic of South \nSudan, who chose the path of peace and mediation. We \ncall on the two countries to resolve all outstanding \nissues through peaceful means. I wish His Excellency \nPresident Salva Kiir Mayardit success as he leads the \npeople of South Sudan in building a united and \nprosperous nation. \n Namibia calls for the immediate implementation \nof the United Nations settlement plan and relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions calling for the holding of a \nfree and fair referendum in Western Sahara. \n With regard to Palestine, I reaffirm our full and \nunequivocal support for the legitimate struggle of the \nPalestinian people to achieve their inalienable right to \nself-determination and national independence. Namibia \nsupports the admission of Palestine to the United \nNations as a full Member.  \n The overwhelming majority of the Member States \nof the Assembly have for many years expressed serious \nconcern over the continuing economic, commercial and \nfinancial embargo against the Republic of Cuba. \nNamibia calls for the immediate and unconditional \nlifting of this embargo. \n Namibia welcomes the recent signing of the road \nmap by the Malagasy political stakeholders with the \nfacilitation of the Southern African Development \nCommunity mediator. It paves the way for bringing an \nend to the political crisis and returning Madagascar to \nconstitutional order and democratic rule. The United \nNations and the international community should \nprovide adequate financial support to that country and \nbecome actively engaged in the ongoing mediation \nefforts to ensure the full implementation of the road \nmap. \n  \n \n11-51185 20 \n \n The people of Somalia are faced with not only \npolitical uncertainty but also a severe drought and \nfamine, which have resulted in a human catastrophe. \nNamibia has joined the international community in \ncontributing food supplies to the people of Somalia as \npart of the international effort to address the crisis. \n The effects of climate change are real and are \nacutely felt in every part of the globe. For the past \nthree consecutive years Namibia has experienced \ndevastating floods, which negatively impacted our \ndevelopment plans. I take this opportunity to once \nagain thank members of the international community \nwho responded to our emergency appeal for assistance. \n Now more than ever before, all Member States \nshould work towards the successful conclusion of the \nseventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nwhich will take place in Durban, South Africa, later \nthis year. This should set the tone for the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, \nRio+20, to be held in Rio de Janeiro next year.  \n The reform of the United Nations system, \nespecially the Security Council, has been painfully \nslow. I underscore Namibia\u2019s firm conviction that a \nreformed Security Council should be democratic, \nrepresentative and transparent in its working methods. \nThat is consistent with the African common position. It \nis incumbent on all Member States to work together to \nstrengthen the Organization in order to guarantee \ninternational peace and security and to advance \nsustainable economic and social development for a \nfairer and more just world for all."

        "file_text": "I am grateful \nto the Almighty Allah, who has granted me once more \nan opportunity to appear before the General Assembly. \nI have the pleasure to express my sincere thanks to His \nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session, for his tremendous \nefforts during his tenure. I would also like to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser on his election as the President of the \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. \n Let me seize this opportunity to pay tribute to all \nthose who lost their lives in the past year as a result of \nnatural disasters, in particular the victims of the tragic \nfamine in Somalia and the devastating flood in \nPakistan. I urge everyone to intensify their assistance \nto the affected populations in those countries.  \n Over the past years, I have spoken about different \nglobal issues and the need to introduce fundamental \nchanges in the current international order. Today, \nconsidering international developments, I will try to \nanalyze the present situation from a different angle. \n As everyone knows, the superiority of human \nbeings and their dominance over other creatures lie in \nthe very nature and the truth of humankind, which is a \ndivine gift and a manifestation of the divine spirit \nembodying faith in God, the everlasting Creator and \nPlanner of the entire universe who shows compassion, \ngenerosity, justice and integrity in both words and \ndeeds; the quest for dignity to reach the pinnacles of \nperfection, the aspirations to elevate one\u2019s material and \nspiritual status and the longing to realize liberty; \ndefying oppression, corruption and discrimination and \ntrying to support the oppressed; seeking happiness and \nlasting prosperity and security for all.  \n Those are some of the manifestations of common \ndivine and human attributes that can clearly be seen in \nthe historical aspirations of human beings to create a \nheritage of art and literature, both in prose and poetry, \nand in the socio-cultural and political movements of \nhuman beings throughout the course of history. All \ndivine prophets and social reformers have invited \nhuman beings to tread on this righteous path. God gave \ndignity to humankind in order to elevate its status so \nthat it can assume the role of His successor on Earth. \n It is vividly clear that, despite all historical \nachievements, including the creation of the United \nNations, which was the product of untiring struggles \nand the efforts of free-minded and justice-seeking \nindividuals and of international cooperation, human \nsocieties remain far from fulfilling their noble desires \nand aspirations. Most nations of the world are unhappy \nwith the current international circumstances. Despite \nthe general longing and aspiration for peace, progress \nand fraternity, wars, mass murder, widespread poverty \nand socio-economic and political crises continue to \ninfringe upon the rights and sovereignty of nations, \nleaving behind irreparable damage to all nations \nworldwide.  \n  \n \n11-50865 16 \n \n Approximately, 3 billion of the world\u2019s people \nlive on less than $2.50 a day, and over 200 million \npeople live without even having one proper meal per \nday. Forty per cent of the world\u2019s poorest populations \nonly share 5 per cent of global income, while 20 per \ncent of the richest people share 75 per cent of \neconomic earnings worldwide. More than 20,000 \ninnocent and destitute children around the world die \nevery day because of poverty. Eighty per cent of \nfinancial resources in the United States of America are \ncontrolled by 10 per cent of its people, while only \n20 per cent of those resources belong to 90 per cent of \nthe population. \n What are the causes and reasons behind these \ninequalities? How can one remedy such injustice? \nThose who dominate and run the centres of global \neconomic power put the blame on peoples\u2019 religious \naspirations and the pursuit of the path of divine \nprophets, or on the weakness of nations and the poor \nperformance of a number of groups or individuals. \nThey claim that only their views, approaches and \nprescriptions can save humankind and the world \neconomy. I ask everyone here whether they think that \nthe root cause of the problems can be solved in the \nprevailing international order of the way the world is \ngoverned. \n I want to draw attention to the following \nquestions. Who abducted by force tens of millions of \npeople from their homes in Africa and other regions of \nthe world during the dark period of slavery, making \nAfricans the victims of the materialistic greed of the \nUnited States and Europe? Who imposed colonialism \non the world for over four centuries? Who occupied \nlands and massively plundered other nations\u2019 \nresources, destroyed talents and obliterated native \nlanguages, cultures and national identities? Who \ntriggered the First and Second World Wars, which left \n70 million dead and hundreds of millions injured or \nhomeless? Who created the wars in the Korean \npeninsula and Viet Nam?  \n Who imposed, through deceit and hypocrisy, the \nZionist agenda and almost 60 years of war, \nhomelessness, terror and mass murder on the \nPalestinian people and the countries of the region? \nWho imposed and supported for decades military \ndictatorships and totalitarian regimes on Asian, African \nand Latin American nations, and established friendly \nrelations with all of them? Who used atomic bombs \nagainst defenceless people and then stockpiled \nthousands of warheads in their arsenals? Whose \neconomies rely on waging wars and selling arms?  \n Who provoked and encouraged Saddam Hussein \nto invade and impose an eight-year war on Iran, and \nwho assisted and equipped him to deploy chemical \nweapons against our cities and our people? Who used \nthe mysterious 11 September incident as a pretext to \nattack Afghanistan and Iraq, killing, injuring and \ndisplacing millions in those two countries, with the \nultimate goal of bringing the Middle East and its oil \nresources under its domination?  \n Who undermined the Bretton Woods system and \nprinted trillions of dollars without the backing of gold \nreserves or an equivalent currency, a move that \ntriggered inflation worldwide and was intended to prey \non the economic gains of other nations? What \ncountry\u2019s annual military spending exceeds $1 trillion \nannually \u2014 more than the military budgets of all \ncountries of the world combined? Which Governments \nare the ones most indebted in the world, and which \nGovernment threatens all nations and countries on any \npretext?  \n Who dominates the policymaking establishments \nof the world economy? Who are the ones who are \nresponsible for the world economic recession and are \nimposing its consequences in the United States and \nEurope on Asian, African, Latin American and all other \nnations? Which Governments are ever ready to drop \nthousands of bombs on other countries but ponder and \nhesitate to send a bit of food aid to famine-stricken \npeople in Somalia or elsewhere? Who are the ones \ndominating the Security Council, which is ostensibly \nresponsible for safeguarding international security?  \n There exist dozens of other similar questions, and \nof course the answers are clear. The majority of nations \nand Governments of the world have had no role in the \ncreation of the current global crisis, and in fact are \nthemselves the victims of such policies. It is as clear as \ndaylight that the same slave-masters and colonial \nPowers that once triggered the two World Wars have \ncaused widespread misery and disorder, with far-\nreaching effects across the globe since then. They \ncontinue to control the international political centres \nand the Security Council.  \n Do those arrogant Powers really have the \ncompetence and ability to run or govern the world? Is \nit acceptable that they call themselves the sole \ndefenders of freedom, democracy and human rights, \n \n \n17 11-50865 \n \nwhile they attack and occupy other countries \nmilitarily? Can the flower of democracy blossom from \nNATO\u2019s missiles, bombs and guns?  \n If some European countries still use the \nHolocaust \u2014 after six decades \u2014 as an excuse to pay \nransom to the Zionists, should it not be an obligation of \nthe slave masters and colonial Powers to pay \nreparations to the affected nations? If the damage and \nlosses of the period of slavery and colonialism were \nindeed compensated for, what would happen to the \nmanipulators and behind-the-scenes political powers in \nthe United States and Europe? Would the gaps between \nthe North and the South remain? If only half of the \nmilitary expenditures of the United States and its allies \nin NATO were cut to help solve the economic problems \nin their own countries, would they be experiencing any \nsymptoms of the economic crisis? What would happen \nif the same amount were allocated to poor nations?  \n What is the justification for the presence of \nhundreds of United States military and intelligence \nbases in various parts of the world, including 268 bases \nin Germany, 124 in Japan, 87 in the Republic of Korea, \n83 in Italy, 45 in the United Kingdom, 21 in Portugal \nand hundreds of other bases in other parts of the \nworld? Is that anything other than military occupation? \nDo not the bombs deployed in the United States bases \nundermine the security of other nations? \n The main question is the root causes of such \nattitudes. The prime reason should be sought in the \nbeliefs and tendencies of the establishment, which is \nmade up of people in conflict with their inner human \ninstincts and disposition, who also have no faith in God \nand in the path of the divine prophets to replace their \nlust for power and materialistic ends with heavenly \nvalues. To them, only power and wealth prevail. Every \nattempt must be made to bring into focus those sinister \ngoals.  \n Oppressed nations have no hope to safeguard or \nprotect their legitimate rights against those Powers. \nThose Powers seek their progress, prosperity and \ndignity through the poverty, humiliation and \nannihilation of others. They consider themselves \nsuperior to others, enjoying special privileges or \nconcessions. They have no respect for others and \ncasually violate the rights of all nations and \nGovernments. They proclaim themselves the \nindisputable custodians of all Governments and nations \nthrough intimidation, recourse to threats and force, and \nthe abuse of international mechanisms.  \n They insist on imposing their lifestyle and beliefs \non others. They officially support racism. They weaken \ncountries through military intervention and destroy \ntheir infrastructure in order to plunder their resources \nby making them all the more dependent. They sow the \nseeds of hate and hostility among nations and people of \ndifferent pursuits in order to prevent them from \nfulfilling their goals of development and progress. \n All cultural identities, lives and values, as well as \nthe wealth of nations and human values, including of \nwomen, children and youth, are sacrificed to their \nhegemonistic tendencies and their inclination to \nenslave and capture other nations. \n Hypocrisy and deceit are allowed in order to \nsecure their interests and imperialistic intentions. Drug \ntrafficking and the killing of innocent human beings \nare also allowed in pursuit of such diabolical goals. \nDespite NATO\u2019s presence in occupied Afghanistan, \nthere has been a dramatic increase in the production of \nillicit drugs in that country. \n They tolerate no question or criticism and, \ninstead of presenting a reason for their violations, they \nalways put themselves in the position of a claimant. \n By using their imperialistic media network, \nwhich is under the influence of colonialism, they \nthreaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the \nevent of 11 September with sanctions and military \naction. \n Last year, when the need to form a fact-finding \nteam to undertake a thorough investigation concerning \nthe hidden elements involved in the 11 September \nincident was brought up \u2014 an idea also endorsed by all \nindependent Governments and nations, as well as by \nthe majority of people in the United States \u2014 my \ncountry and I were pressured and threatened by the \nGovernment of the United States. Instead of assigning \na fact-finding team, they killed the main perpetrator \nand threw his body into the sea. \n Would it not have been reasonable to bring to \njustice and openly try the main perpetrator of the \nincident in order to identify the elements and reasons \nbehind the safe space provided for the invading aircraft \nto attack the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center? \nWhy should it not have been allowed to bring him to \ntrial so as to help efforts to recognize those who \n  \n \n11-50865 18 \n \nlaunched terrorist groups and brought wars and other \nmiseries into the region? Is there any classified \ninformation that must be kept secret? \n They view Zionism as a sacred notion or \nideology. Any question concerning its foundation and \nhistory is condemned by them as an unforgivable sin. \nHowever, they endorse and allow sacrileges and insults \nagainst the beliefs of other divine religions. \n Real freedom, justice, dignity and well-being and \nlasting security are the rights of all nations. Those \nvalues can be achieved neither by reliance on the \ncurrent inefficient system of world governance nor \nthrough the intervention of the world\u2019s arrogant Powers \nor the gun barrels of NATO forces. Those values can be \nrealized only through independence, the recognition of \nothers\u2019 rights, harmony and cooperation. \n Is there any way to address the problems and \nchallenges besetting the world by using the prevailing \ninternational mechanisms and tools so as to help \nhumankind achieve its long-standing aspirations of \npeace, security and equality? \n All those who tried to introduce reforms while \npreserving the existing norms and tendencies have \nfailed. The valuable efforts made by the Non-Aligned \nMovement, the Group of 77 and the Group of 15, as \nwell as by some prominent individuals, have failed to \nbring about fundamental changes, although they did \nhave their respective impacts and effects. \n The governance and management of the world \nrequire fundamental reforms, but what has to be done \nnow? Efforts must be made, with firm resolve and \nthrough collective cooperation, to map out a new plan \non the basis of principles and the very foundation of \nsuch universal human values as monotheism, justice, \nfreedom, love and the quest for happiness, on the basis \nof happiness for all. \n The idea of creating the United Nations remains a \ngreat and historic achievement of humankind. Its \nimportance must be appreciated and its capacities must \nbe used for our noble goals, to the extent possible. We \nshould not allow the Organization, which reflects the \ncollective will and shared aspirations of the community \nof nations, to deviate from its main course and play \ninto the hands of the world Powers. \n The necessary groundwork must be laid to ensure \ncollective participation and the involvement of nations \nin efforts to promote lasting peace and security. The \nshared and collective management of the world must \nbe achieved in its true sense and be based on the \nunderlying principles enshrined in international law. \nJustice must serve as the criterion and the basis for all \ninternational decisions and actions.  \n All of us should acknowledge the fact that there \nis no way other than the shared and collective \nmanagement of the world to put an end to today\u2019s \nworldwide disorder, tyranny and discrimination. This is \nindeed the only way to ensure the prosperity and \nwelfare of human society, which is an established and \nvivid truth. While acknowledging that truth, one should \nnote that acknowledgement alone is not enough. We \nmust believe in it and spare no effort towards its \nrealization. \n The shared and collective management of the \nworld is the legitimate right of all nations. As their \nrepresentatives, we have an obligation to defend their \nrights. Although some Powers continuously try to \nfrustrate all international efforts aimed at promoting \ncollective cooperation, we must nevertheless \nstrengthen our belief in achieving the desired goal of \nestablishing shared and collective cooperation to run \nthe world. \n The United Nations was created to enable the \neffective participation of all nations in international \ndecision-making processes. We all know that this goal \nhas not yet been fulfilled, owing to the absence of \njustice in the current management structures and \nmechanisms of the United Nations.  \n The composition of the Security Council is unjust \nand inequitable. Therefore, changes that include the \nrestructuring of the United Nations are considered as \nthe basic demands of nations and must be addressed by \nthe General Assembly. \n During last year\u2019s session, I emphasized the \nimportance of this issue and called for the designation \nof the present decade as the decade of shared and \ncollective global management, and for all capacities \nand resources to be mobilized in that direction. I would \nnow like to reiterate my proposal. I am sure that, \nthrough international cooperation, the efforts of \ncommitted world leaders and Governments, an \ninsistence on justice and the support of all other \nnations, we can expedite the process of building a \nbright common future. This movement is certainly on \nthe rightful path to its creation, and carries with it the \nassurance of a promising future for humankind. That \n \n \n19 11-50865 \n \nfuture will be built when humankind sets off on the \npath of the divine prophets and the righteous, under the \nleadership of Imam Al-Mahdi, the ultimate saviour of \nhumankind and the heir to all divine messengers and \nleaders and to the pure generation of our great prophet. \n The creation of a supreme and ideal society with \nthe arrival of a perfect human being who is a true and \nsincere lover of all humankind is the guaranteed \npromise of Allah. He will come with Jesus Christ to \nlead those who love freedom and justice to eradicate \ntyranny and discrimination and promote knowledge, \npeace, justice, freedom and love across the world. He \nwill present to every single individual all the beauty of \nthe world and all good things that bring happiness, the \npromise of a better tomorrow and the sweet taste of life \nto all humankind.  \n Today nations have been awakened and, with the \nincrease in public awareness, they no longer submit to \noppression and discrimination. The world today is \nwitnessing more than ever a widespread awakening in \nIslamic lands, in Asia, in Europe and in America. \nEvery day, those movements are expanding their scope \nand influence to pursue the realization of justice, \nfreedom and the creation of a better tomorrow. \n Our great nation, with its millennial civilization \nand history, stands ready to join hands with other \nnations to march along that beautiful path, in harmony \nand in line with the shared aspirations of humankind. \nLet us salute love and freedom, let us salute justice and \nknowledge and let us salute the bright future that \nawaits humankind."

        "file_text": "Senegal \nwelcomes the election of Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser as President of the General Assembly to lead \nits work at this sixty-sixth session. Therefore, I address \nto him and his country my warm congratulations. He \nwill have the support of the Senegalese delegation \nthroughout his mandate. \n I also extend to the President\u2019s predecessor, \nMr. Joseph Deiss, our appreciation for all his efforts to \nrevitalize and strengthen the General Assembly so that \nit may play its role under the Charter. \n In addition, I also reiterate to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, my warmest \ncongratulations on everything he has done for the \nOrganization. \n I should like to touch on the theme of the session, \nthe role of mediation in the settlement of disputes. The \nCharter has a number of provisions for the prevention \nof conflicts and for conflict-resolution. This goal, \nwhich was set down in the Charter 66 years ago by the \nfounding fathers, remains, despite evident progress, a \nlong way off. This challenge concerns us, just as it \nengages our collective and individual responsibility to \nsave current and future generations from the scourge of \nwar.  \n \n \n5 11-50847 \n \n While the spectre of a major conflict has faded \nsince the end of the Cold War, millions of men and \nwomen around the world continue to suffer the \ndisastrous consequences of conflicts old and new. \n Peace can be threatened in different ways. It can \nbe threatened when, on the fertile ground of political \nantagonisms and social, economic and religious \nconflicts, confrontation gains the upper hand over \ntolerance, respect and acceptance of our differences. \n Peace is also threatened when the legitimate \naspirations of peoples to freedom and respect for \nhuman rights find in response only indifference and \nrefusal of dialogue, if not systematic repression, as is \nthe case in a number of countries. \n Our theme, mediation, is addressed in the \nCharter, but there are similar notions, such as good \noffices and negotiations. I would like to contribute \nsomething by defining mediation as a mechanism \nwhereby a person, a State or an institution comes \nbetween two parties in real or potential conflict and \nseeks to bring their points of view closer together, with \na view to bringing the parties to make concessions and \nreach a consensus. That can apply to internal conflicts \nas well as conflicts between States. \n I wish to refer to resolution 37/10, of 1982, \napproving the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \nSettlement of International Disputes, and the 1988 \nDeclaration on the Prevention and Removal of \nDisputes and Situations which May Threaten \nInternational Peace and Security and on the Role of the \nUnited Nations in this Field (resolution 43/51). To \nthese may be added the Agenda for Peace (A/47/277), \ndrafted after the first Security Council summit meeting, \nheld in January 1992, establishing a doctrine of \nso-called tension-prevention through early warning and \npreventive diplomacy. \n The fact is that by no stretch of the imagination \ncan our Organization alone do everything. We must \nconsider mediation efforts at other levels, such as the \nregional level. It is a pity that Africa has forgotten an \noriginal mechanism often used following \nindependence: meetings between Heads of State at \ntheir border to directly address their differences. \nUnfortunately, this good practice is falling out of \nfashion, with general international mechanisms being \nfavoured. \n In the two categories of mediation \u2014 within a \ncountry or between countries \u2014 we have very rich \nexperiences in West Africa. I shall limit myself to only \nmentioning them, because some are fairly well known.  \n For example, with regard to internal conflict, \nwhen I was head of an opposition party I personally \nintervened at the request of Heads of State, who \nappreciated that I had chosen a democratic internal \nopposition instead of armed national liberation \nmovements. I often succeeded in bringing together \npoints of view and even in integrating opposition into \nvarious Governments, which I did myself later by \nagreeing to enter the Government of the person who \nhad been my adversary in a number of elections. \n I can give the example of Guinea-Bissau, a matter \nresolved by a trio of Heads of State, of whom I was \none, which decided to travel to the country, which was \nin conflict with the army. Order was successfully \nre-established. The countries concerned were Nigeria, \nGhana and Senegal. More recently there was the \nIvorian crisis, which ended happily thanks to the \nEconomic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), supported by the United Nations and \nFrance. \n I could add the normalization of the situation in \nNiger and Guinea-Conakry through the mediation of \nECOWAS, which succeeded despite difficulties in \nestablishing an elected Government. I can also cite the \npeaceful declaration of independence of the State of \nSouth Sudan. I commend the representative of that \nbrother country here at the United Nations. \n There are of course other cases. The examples I \nhave given were just to show that at the regional level \nmany conflicts can be settled directly by States, \nsometimes with the assistance of an outside country, \nsuch as France, or with the assistance of the United \nNations. \n To conclude that list of countries, I want to say \nthat just a few days ago, as there is a threat of trouble \non the border between Liberia and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the \nPresident of ECOWAS convened a small group of \nneighbouring countries, and we were able, with the \nhelp of the United Nations, to establish a mechanism to \nprevent the intervention of mercenaries in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire who were seeking to enter Liberia to \ndestabilize the country during election time. \n  \n \n11-50847 6 \n \n Sadly, despite those successes, there are other \npotential conflicts, such as that which is harming \nrelations between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and the \npotential conflict in Darfur. \n I turn to mediation used in conflicts between \nStates. I shall take just one example: Palestine and the \nState of Israel. I commend all the efforts made over \nmany years to bring the two parties closer together, \nwhich unfortunately have not yet succeeded. So this \nyear we have an application by Palestine to the General \nAssembly for recognition as a Member State of the \nUnited Nations. There is no doubt about Senegal\u2019s \nsupport for the application; it is the consequence of \nwhat has been our policy for a long time, particularly \nas today Senegal is Chairman of the United Nations \nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \nthe Palestinian People. \n Senegal supports an independent Palestinian State \nwithin internationally recognized borders as well as the \nexistence of the State of Israel, each within its own \nborders. It will not be easy to achieve that, but the \ninternational community will do its very best. \n I take this opportunity to make a clarification, \nbecause, despite my proximity to the Arab countries \nand to the Palestinians, a few days ago a statement was \nmade about my playing the role of mediator in the \nIsrael-Palestine conflict. President Netanyahu\u2019s \nunderstanding was mistaken. I have never been a \nmediator in the Palestine-Israel conflict and have never \nsought to be a mediator. Moreover, we need to do much \nmore than to call one country or one person to mediate \nin such a complicated situation. \n All goodwill is needed for a solution. Having \nbeen awarded the Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Peace Prize, I \nmust honour that distinction, so wherever I can \nintervene to find solutions I do so, on my own \nresponsibility. I intervened personally for the release of \na young soldier, Gilad Shalit, a few years ago.  \n Unfortunately, that was not successful, but on the \nbasis of a number of suggestions I took the initiative \nonce again some days ago. That seems to have had a \nreaction, in the light of what President Netanyahu said. \nHe said that he did not want mediation by Senegal, and \nthat Senegal was an ally of Palestine. But he was \nwrong. I do not do mediation; I provide good offices; I \ntake it on my own responsibility to help release one \nyoung man when I believe that that young man should \nbe elsewhere other than a prison and when I think that I \ncan convince the parties \u2014 above all, the Palestinian \nparties, the current Government of Palestine, Hamas \u2014 \nof the need to release that young man for humanitarian \nreasons.  \n If I succeed, excellent; if I fail, it will not stop me \nfrom starting over again. I will do that regardless of the \nposition of the two parties \u2014 in other words, \nregardless of the position of Israel and of the position \nof Hamas. That is consistent with my philosophy of \npeace and the choice that I have made to contribute to \nextending cooperation where I can. \n I believe that fear and mistrust, which persist \nbetween Israel and Palestine, could be mitigated \u2014 this \nis a simple suggestion that I make to our Secretary-\nGeneral \u2014 by establishing a committee of three States \nchosen by the two parties. Those States would hold \ndiscussions to discover what guarantees are demanded \nby each party to commit to the path of negotiation for \nthe existence of two States, the State of Israel and the \nState of Palestine, because at present, I believe, there is \nno dialogue, indirect or direct. I believe that my \nsuggestion could facilitate understanding of the \npositions on both sides and could help mitigate fears \nand concerns that are major psychological barriers to \ndiscussion and to any agreement. \n Maybe I am wrong. Maybe this will not end in \nanything, but it costs nothing to try. I say to the \nSecretary-General: \u201cBefore you reply \u2018No\u2019, I want you \nto consider my proposal for 40 days. If after that time \nyou think that it cannot help solve the problem, you \ncan say so. But I beg you to try to understand the \nproposal.\u201d I am ready to go into further details, even in \na document. I have established this position, which \ncould ultimately be fine-tuned using other people\u2019s \ncontributions. \n As I come to the end of my address I want to \ntouch on Security Council reform. The topic has kept \nreturning in a cyclical fashion for 18 years, and we \nhave made no progress, due to great confusion. \n The current Security Council system has certain \nadvantages. A Security Council, an international order, \nmust exist, but it must be improved. But in its current \nfunctioning the Security Council has a fundamental \nrole, which is to ignore the African continent. Even on \nrecent issues, such as Libya, Africa has no permanent \nseat with a right of veto.  \n \n \n7 11-50847 \n \n I will not speak of general reform of the Security \nCouncil. I know that it will not happen overnight. But I \nalso know that since its creation there has been a need \nto increase the number of seats, and there needs to be a \nbetter distribution. \n I call for the remedying of a historic injustice to \nAfrica. Seventy per cent of the issues on the Security \nCouncil agenda are African questions, and Africa is \nabsent, even on the question of Libya. Libya is an \nAfrican country. Therefore, it would be good to have \nan African country with a permanent seat on the \nSecurity Council with a right to the veto. I am not \ntalking about a non-permanent seat; it must be \npermanent.  \n We have made progress, because when a few \nyears ago I had discussions with members of the \nCouncil the majority thought that the idea was \nreasonable, if it could be detached from more general \ndemands. But each time we bring it up it is a case of \none step forward, two steps back. But we should not be \ndiscouraged. \n I come to my last point: the environment and the \nagricultural crisis. These are also issues of peace, \nbecause the environment is linked to climate change \naffecting particularly the developing countries, and \nabove all Africa. \n A few years ago a French philosopher wrote a \nfamous work, \u201cL\u2019Afrique, terre qui meurt\u201d, in which he \nspoke of savannization and desertification, problems \nthat my own country suffers from. In the Sahel I find \nthat those words are particularly well based.  \n Above all, coastal erosion is accelerating. From \nMorocco to the Gulf of Guinea seawater is filtering \nthrough layers of the continental shelf deep into the \ncontinent \u2014 480 kilometres \u2014 salinizating the water \ntable, with the result that the population is suffering an \nincreasing lack of drinking water. \n Marine erosion does not just mean that the coast \nis being eroded by the sea. It is destroying land in the \ninterior, and making populations emigrate towards \nareas where they can find potable water. It is \nhistorically one of the main mechanisms of \ndesertification. Sometimes whole populations are \nforced to go elsewhere. \n But we are not standing idly by. That is why we \nhave created the Great Green Wall, extending from \nDakar to Djibouti, 7,000 kilometres long and \n15 kilometres wide. That is why we called on the EU to \nfinance a study with European and African experts to \nfind a solution to the infiltration of marine waters into \nthe continental shelf. \n We have built part of the Atlantic wall in Senegal, \nbut only two kilometres, because one kilometre costs a \ngreat deal of money \u2014 $2 million. In depth it is to go \nas far as the granite plateau, at which point it can go no \nfurther. We do not want to take it too far, because in \nenvironmental matters it is important before doing \nanything to find out what the consequences elsewhere \nwill be.  \n That is why we need to analyse the matter in an \nentirely scientific way, since the forces of the sea that \nare stopped have not been negated; they are diverted by \nthe sand and liquids. The experts can clarify the \nsituation and help us, with full knowledge of the facts, \nuse our resources to end this degradation, which, sadly, \nis leading to the disappearance of a large part of our \ncontinent. The tsunami is not just the effect of huge \nwaves on a coast. It is also destruction that happens \nwithin our continent. I wanted to mention that \nphenomenon to draw attention to the great dangers \nthreatening Africa. \n Finally, we recently held the second International \nDakar Agricultural Forum to consider the rise in \nagriculture prices, from which even producing \ncountries are suffering, like us, because we are also big \nconsumers. The participants proposed the \nestablishment of an organization for global agricultural \ngovernance. We urge that the headquarters of such an \nimportant institution be in Africa, and not in a \ndeveloped country. There is no major organization of \nits kind with its headquarters in Africa. The \norganizations that are helping us need to be with us on \nthe ground.  \n The role of the proposed organization would be to \nregulate the prices of agricultural products and ensure a \nminimum income for small farmers. I commend our \ndraft resolution on the matter. The policy of the \norganization could be to play a role in reducing \nproductivity differentials. Why is productivity higher \nin the United States and Europe than in Africa \u2014 for \nexample, in Zimbabwe? We need to ask the question \nand find solutions. \n In Senegal, we have addressed the issue with a \nplan that we call the Grand Agricultural Offensive for \nFood and Abundance to deal with the productivity \n  \n \n11-50847 8 \n \ndifferentials between Senegal and certain Italian \nregions. It has allowed us to move from being, in 2007, \ndependent on others for food to the status of a country \nthat has achieved food self-sufficiency. This year we \nmay even be able to begin exporting, which is a \nremarkable achievement. \n I must say that we have been helped by chance, \nsince fertilizer constitutes at least 30 per cent of costs, \nand our fertilizer can be used directly, without any \npreparation. Moreover, friendly countries helped us \nacquire important equipment on very favourable \nconditions over a long term. \n The scope and complexity of the Organization\u2019s \ntasks put in perspective its successes and its setbacks. \nBut what determines our commitment to the institution, \nwhat gives hope to the peoples that we represent here, \nwhat definitively gives them trust and faith in the \nOrganization, is the feeling that when it deliberates, \nwhen it decides and when it acts, it observes without \ndiscrimination the principles enshrined in the Charter: \nuniversality, legality, justice and impartiality. \n Finally, the extent to which those values are \nsafeguarded is the measure of the legitimacy and \nsuccess of our Organization\u2019s interventions."

        "file_text": "On behalf of my \ndelegation and the Government and the people of the \nCommonwealth of Dominica, I would like to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \nAl-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to \nassure him of our full cooperation. We are confident \nthat with his skills and experience, he will bring \nleadership to this Assembly as it addresses the \nextensive and important agenda of this sixty-sixth \nsession.  \n I also extend a special welcome to the newest \nmember of this Assembly, the Republic of South \nSudan, which became the 193rd Member of the United \nNations in July. \n I would also like to convey Dominica\u2019s \nappreciation to Mr. Al-Nasser\u2019s predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for having so ably guided \nthe proceedings of the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly. We also express our gratitude for the \ncontinued efforts of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon \nand for his leadership at this most challenging time. \n This meeting is being convened at a time of \ntremendous global insecurity. Never in the history of \nhumankind have we had to struggle for our own \nexistence as we have done in this past decade. We are \nstill faced with unstable global financial markets, \nissues of food availability and affordability, increasing \nunrest in some regions and the high cost of energy, and \nwe seem set to endure the mounting consequences of \nMother Earth\u2019s response to decades of global warming. \n Countries like Dominica, located in the \nCaribbean Sea, are again in hurricane season, a period \n  \n \n11-51687 4 \n \nof high vulnerability that we in the Caribbean \nexperience for a period of four to six months each year. \nFresh in our minds are the recent unfortunate events \nthat took place in the eastern United States. For the \nfirst time in its recorded history, the city in which we \nare convened came to a complete standstill because of \nHurricane Irene in late August. \n We in the Caribbean understand clearly the \nchallenges faced in the aftermath of hurricanes, as \nthese are the kinds of disasters that small island States \nsuch as Dominica are forced to routinely schedule on \nour calendar of events and brace for every six months. \nFor us, each year\u2019s recovery efforts could become next \nyear\u2019s destruction point. On behalf of my delegation, I \nextend my condolences to and empathize with all those \nwho were affected by Hurricane Irene. \n For reasons such as these, each year we come \nbefore this Assembly to report on the deterioration not \nonly of the environment, but also of climate change \nnegotiations. With full knowledge that these impacts \nare projected to increase over time, we believe that we \ncan build on a number of outcomes agreed to in \nCanc\u00fan. We also believe that although some responses \nmight not meet every Member State\u2019s expectation, they \ncould act as catalysts and springboards for new \napproaches and new solutions in Durban. \n As witnesses to environmental degradation at a \ntime when reliance on the ecosystem to provide energy \nfor basic needs continues to intensify, we as a people \ncannot continue to ignore the subject of climate \nchange. We believe that climate change is an energy-\nrelated issue and that the provision of reliable, \naccessible and affordable energy and its by-products \nare critical to sustainable development and the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \n Despite unfulfilled promises and a slow start to \nfast-start funding, we must report on actions advanced \nsince Canc\u00fan that have helped position the small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS) to transform their energy \nsectors. Specifically, I refer to the SIDS Sustainable \nEnergy Initiative, also known as SIDS DOCK.  \n Almost 30 SIDS have signed an agreement to \nestablish this initiative, created by the Alliance of \nSmall Island States (AOSIS) under the chairmanship of \nGrenada and in partnership with the Government of \nDenmark, the United Nations Development Programme \nand the World Bank. We wish to thank the Government \nof Denmark for its significant financial contribution to \noperationalizing this facility and for the leadership that \nit has given and continues to give to the process. My \ndelegation expresses its gratitude to the other members \nof AOSIS for staying the course and reaffirms \nDominica\u2019s commitment to the initiative. \n SIDS DOCK was the outstanding outcome for \nSIDS at Canc\u00fan, and, as we set our sights on Durban, \nthe expectation is that other partners will support the \ninitiative, which is set to transform the energy sector in \nSIDS. It is our hope that sufficient progress will be \nmade in negotiating appropriate measures that might be \nimplemented to address the losses and damage \nassociated with the adverse effects of climate change, \nincluding impacts related to extreme weather as well as \nslow-onset events. \n These two initiatives are within the framework of \nthe Bali Road Map and Action Plan and reflect actions \nthat are geared towards the fulfilment of commitments \nand giving effect to the Canc\u00fan decisions. \n It is no secret that the Kyoto Protocol is in \nserious trouble. While it represents less than 30 per \ncent of greenhouse-gas emissions, it remains the only \nlegally binding global agreement in our quest to \naddress the growing threat of climate change. In order \nto build on the gains made under the first commitment \nperiod, we must ensure that the broad principles \nsecured in the Kyoto Protocol are maintained in any \nlegally binding global agreement at Durban. \n A sustainable energy sector is the foundation for \nsustainable development in small island States such as \nDominica. For the past decade, Dominica has been \nworking towards the development of our geothermal \npotential, with the assistance of international agencies \nand development partners. \n With the support and contribution of the \nEuropean Union, the Government of France and the \nRegional Councils of Guadeloupe and Martinique, we \nare now closer to the realization of our goal. \nPreparation for drilling has begun, and the three test \nwells will be complete by the end of 2011. \n The development of our geothermal potential will \nprovide us with the capacity to meet our domestic \nneeds and supply electricity to our neighbouring \nislands, especially the French territories of Guadeloupe \nand Martinique, through our connection via submarine \ncables. With this displacement of hundreds of \nmegawatts of fossil-generated power, coupled with our \n \n \n5 11-51687 \n \nsustainable development practices, Dominica\u2019s target is \nto be not only carbon-neutral but also carbon-negative \nby the year 2020. \n Like Dominica, many SIDS are pursuing their \nown renewable-energy initiatives. However, \nunsustainable debt burdens and lack of technology \nhave made such initiatives almost impossible for some \nSIDS. We invite other developed countries and \ninternational institutions to join the Government of \nDenmark in SIDS DOCK and the Government of \nNorway in its \u201cEnergy for all\u201d initiative, by providing \nthe critical support that SIDS so desperately need. \n We in the SIDS are committed to playing our \npart; suffice it to say, however, that there are still some \nmajor obstacles impeding the pace of progress, \nparticularly financing for SIDS-appropriate technology \nand transfer. As part of the United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development (Rio+20) process, \nDominica calls on the Secretary-General to establish a \nspecial SIDS-appropriate technology fund to address \nthe issue of innovative financing for sustainable energy \ntechnology transfer and development for small island \nStates. In that regard, we also ask that the Secretary-\nGeneral consider appointing a goodwill ambassador \ntasked with advocating on behalf of SIDS and helping \nthe Secretary-General in supporting the Fund. The \neffective transfer and development of SIDS-appropriate \ntechnology is essential for SIDS to build resilience to \nthe present and future impacts of climate change. \n In addition to looking forward to securing a \nrenewed political commitment for sustainable \ndevelopment at Rio+20, the SIDS expect that the \ninternational community will reaffirm their support \nwith the new and additional resources required to \nimplement the programmes and activities agreed to, \nfrom Agenda 21 to the Barbados Programme of Action \nand the Mauritius Strategy for the further \nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.  \n Any renewed commitments and agreements \nreached at Rio+20 must address the major impediments \nto implementing these summit outcomes, including the \nlimited technical, financial and human resources, as \nwell as the impact of exogenous factors, particularly \nthe global financial crisis. \n There is no denying the importance of national \nsecurity to a society; thus the unregulated, \nnon-standardized and highly dangerous trade in arms \nand ammunition poses great threats to law and order in \nour societies. The Caribbean region is not a \nmanufacturer of arms or ammunition, yet large \nquantities of illegal firearms and ammunition often \nassociated with the illegal drug trade are transferred \nacross our borders, infiltrating our society and causing \nmayhem and death, overburdening our health-care \nsystem and contributing to the destabilization of \neconomic progress and well-being. The region has lost \nsome of its most productive members to this \nunregulated transfer of arms. This is an unsustainable \nsituation for any country, but even more so for small \nisland States. \n Negotiations on an arms trade treaty are \nwelcome, and, as stated in the Caribbean Community \nDeclaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons, \nDominica is committed to full and active participation \nin all efforts related to the issue of small arms. Of \nparticular importance is the 2012 review of the 2001 \nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \nWeapons in All Its Aspects, as well as the 2012 United \nNations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty. \n In the absence of these and other initiatives to \nhelp combat global insecurity, threats to global peace \nand security will continue to multiply in both intensity \nand form. Multilateralism must take centre stage in the \nstruggle to deal with these challenges. The work of the \nUnited Nations is therefore paramount in maintaining \nworld peace and security. In its maintenance of this \nrole, the United Nations must be able to clearly \ndemonstrate legitimacy and fairness in its actions, \ncognizant always of the need to protect the most \nvulnerable. \n The ability of the Security Council to adequately \nrespond to new and changing world dynamics rests \nwith its acceptance of the need for continuous reform \nto adapt to the times, including a recognition of the \nincrease in size of the United Nations membership and \nglobal economic power shifts. Reform reflects more \nthan representation and, in this situation, should \npromote adaptation to the needs of Members and the \ndrafting of strategies that would contribute to ending \nwars and halting disputes. \n In that regard, we welcome Mr. Al-Nasser\u2019s \nproposal of \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means\u201d as the theme for the high-\nlevel debate at the opening of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n  \n \n11-51687 6 \n \n Earlier I spoke of the threats which plague \nmankind in this era of globalization. I also highlighted \nthe need for multilateralism and for cooperation \nbetween and among States. These challenges can be \novercome only in a global environment where there \nexists respect for one another\u2019s territorial integrity, \nnon-interference in one another\u2019s domestic affairs, \nrespect for sovereignty and the right of self-\ndetermination. It is in this context that we again call on \nthe United States of America to discontinue its \neconomic blockade against the people of the Republic \nof Cuba. \n I also welcome the support of the President of the \nAssembly in keeping our sister island of Haiti on the \nglobal stage. There are few words left to describe the \ndire misery in which our brothers and sisters in Haiti \nare living. The paralysis of reconstruction and \ndevelopment activities has been the hallmark of the \naftermath of the earthquake that devastated that \ncountry in January 2010.  \n We recognize the tremendous challenges to the \nreconstruction efforts and wish to thank those \ncountries, institutions and individuals who have \ncontributed and continue to contribute towards this \nprocess. We again call on those who have made \npledges to make good on their commitments in order to \naccelerate the reconstruction efforts. \n The presence of the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) remains critical to the \nreconstruction efforts by providing security and \nsupport to the people of Haiti. We therefore urge the \nSecurity Council to extend the tenure of MINUSTAH \nto facilitate the efforts of the new Administration of \nHis Excellency President Michel Martelly. \n We all accept that it is critical to collectively \naddress the impact of climate change, to resolve \nconflicts throughout the world and to enhance peace \nand security for humanity. All these efforts, however, \nwill be of little value to our peoples if we are not able \nto ensure that they are healthy. The United Nations has \nshown exemplary leadership in dealing with the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS, together with its partners. This \nsame leadership must now be given to the fight against \nnon-communicable diseases. \n The frightening statistics of 2008 issued by the \nWorld Health Organization, which estimated that \n36 million deaths worldwide were due to \nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs), suggests that this \nphenomenon is not unique to any one region and \ntherefore cannot be downplayed. NCDs pose one of the \ngreatest challenges to the health and development of \nDominica, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and \nthe rest of the world. The severe impacts of \nnon-communicable diseases continue to place \ntremendous pressures on our health-care systems, \nproductivity and already overburdened and struggling \neconomies. \n It was for these reasons that the CARICOM \nHeads of Government issued the Port of Spain \nDeclaration in 2007 to promote healthy lifestyles and \nto combat NCDs in our region. Prior to and since the \ndeclaration, the Dominican Government has adopted a \nnational policy on NCDs. We have further \nimplemented a number of measures as part of our \nmultisectoral efforts to include education; the \nstrengthening of our primary health-care system with \nthe contribution of our partners, the Bolivarian \nRepublic of Venezuela and the Republic of Cuba; the \npromotion of healthy lifestyles; greater access to \ntreatment and free health care; and appropriate \nlegislative and policy changes. The Government of \nDominica endorses the leadership taken by the \nCaribbean Community in this regard. We remain \ncommitted to the well-being of every citizen. \n We join our CARICOM colleagues in thanking \nthe United Nations Member States and Secretariat for \nconvening the successful High-level Meeting on \nNCDs. We look forward to the implementation of the \nPolitical Declaration (resolution 66/2) and call on the \ndeveloped countries to partner with us in our various \nefforts to combat NCDs. \n Finally, Dominica wishes to reaffirm its \nconfidence in the United Nations system as the \nultimate negotiating and deliberating body for \naddressing major challenges confronting the world. \nThe Assembly can count on Dominica\u2019s commitment to \nworking in close collaboration with the United Nations \nagencies and respective Member States to strengthen \nthe mission of this body. We cannot overemphasize the \nfact that, notwithstanding its many limitations and \nimperfections, the United Nations system is critical to \nmaintaining world peace and security and an \ninternational humanitarian system. The world today is \na much better place because of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Nigeria, I would like to \ncongratulate the President on his election as the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I have no doubt that under his able leadership \nthe work of the session will be brought to a successful \nconclusion. I should also like to acknowledge the \nexcellent work done by his predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. Joseph Deiss, who guided the affairs of the sixty-\nfifth session with consummate skill and commitment. \n I must also take this opportunity to extend my \nwarmest felicitations to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon on his well-deserved re-election, a tribute to \nhis leadership and vision. He deserves our appreciation \nfor the good work he is doing on our behalf. \n I also welcome the newest member of the \nOrganization, the Republic of South Sudan. I am \nconfident that South Sudan will bring a unique \nperspective to the work of the United Nations and \nenrich our collective experience. \n Despite our initial optimism, the peace dividend \nwe had hoped would accrue following the end of the \nCold War is yet to materialize. On the contrary, the \nworld of the twenty-first century in which we live is \nbecoming ever more precarious, unpredictable and \ncertainly more dangerous \u2014 perhaps more than at any \nother time in history. The increasing use of terror in \nvarious regions of the world as a form of political \naction poses a serious threat to international peace and \nsecurity. We must win the war against terror because it \ninfringes on the fundamental right of all peoples to life \nand to live in safety from fear. \n Over the past few months, we in Nigeria have \nfaced an upsurge in terrorist attacks in parts of our \ncountry. Only recently, the United Nations building in \nAbuja housing several United Nations agencies was the \ntarget of an atrocious terrorist attack that left several \ndead. On behalf of the Government and people of \nNigeria, I would like to convey my sincere \ncondolences to the families of the victims and to the \nentire United Nations family for this barbaric and \nheinous attack on those who have dedicated their lives \nto helping others. As the United States and the rest of \nthe world commemorate the tenth anniversary of the \nattacks of 9/11, we are reminded of the international \n  \n \n11-50692 44 \n \ndimension of terrorism and the imperative of a \nconcerted global response to combat this scourge. \n For us in Nigeria, terrorist acts, rather than \nintimidating us, will only help to strengthen our \nresolve to develop appropriate national strategies and \nto collaborate even more closely with the international \ncommunity in the fight against this menace. As part of \nNigeria\u2019s efforts to fight terrorism, on 3 June, I signed \ninto law a terrorism bill and an anti-money-laundering \nprohibition amendment act. The new laws not only \noutline measures for preventing and combating acts of \nterrorism, but also prohibit the financing of terrorism \nand laundering of the proceeds of crime. Nigeria will \ncontinue to work with the United Nations and other \npartners in this global fight. \n To that end, Nigeria is working closely with the \nCounter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the \nCounter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, as well as \nwith relevant international bodies and friendly \ncountries, in order to sharpen our response \nmechanisms. In that connection, the Counter-Terrorism \nImplementation Task Force will launch its first project \nin Abuja in November, which will be aimed at \npreventing conflict and countering the appeal of \nterrorism to youth through education and dialogue. In \naddition, Nigeria is a member of a new global body, the \nGlobal Counterterrorism Forum, launched to galvanize \nand help pull our efforts together to fight this scourge \nin all its ramifications. We pledge to continue to work \nwith all stakeholders as we enlarge and intensify our \npartnerships. \n When I stood before the Assembly last year, I \nmade a solemn pledge that Nigeria would conduct free \nand credible elections in the second quarter of this \nyear. I am glad to report that last April we indeed \nconducted what have been adjudged to be credible and \ntransparent general elections. Let me take this \nopportunity to thank the United Nations and all the \nother organizations, nations and individuals that helped \nus to achieve that feat. The elections are now behind \nus, and the Government that I head is well on course to \nimplement our programmes of transformation \u2014 a \nstrategic plan for the delivery of the dividends of \ndemocracy to citizens and for preparing our country for \nthe challenges of the future. Indeed, all across my \ncountry, there is a renewed sense of optimism and self-\nbelief in our ability to recreate a new Nigeria on the \nprinciples of personal freedoms, democracy, good \ngovernance and the rule of law. \n Permit me to identify with the theme of this \nyear\u2019s debate of engaging the role of mediation in the \npeaceful resolution of conflicts in the world. The \nAssembly will recall that Nigeria was in the forefront \nof the campaign to promote this theme when, as the \nPresident of the Security Council in July 2010, my \ncountry adopted the use of preventive diplomacy to \nresolve armed conflicts across the world. This theme is \napt and could not have come at a better time, when \narmed conflicts are increasingly taking a greater part of \nthe time and resources of the United Nations. \n For too long, the international community has \nfocused too little attention on mediation and preventive \ndiplomacy, and far too much effort and resources on \nthe military aspects of peace and security. Yet measures \nto address the root cause of conflict, including dialogue \nand mediation, can be far more effective as a means for \nachieving sustainable peace and stability. \n I believe that cultivating peace and fulfilling the \naims of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter \nrequire early identification and appropriate \nintervention in conflict situations in order to build \nconfidence and trust and to preclude the eruption of \nviolence between opposing parties. As I see it, our goal \nshould always be to present the peaceful alternative as \na less costly and effective way of achieving political \nand social objectives. I also believe that, in addition to \nother traditional tools of preventive diplomacy, \ndemocracy and good governance can be particularly \nimportant in building a just, equitable and inclusive \nsociety. By focusing on mediation as a tool for conflict \nprevention, we are able to address the real triggers of \nconflict, without which we cannot achieve sustainable \nsolutions. \n However, for the world to move from a culture of \nresponse after conflict to that of a culture of \nprevention, the international community must muster \nthe political will to promote preventive diplomacy, in \nparticular through mediation. This will necessarily \nentail rededicating greater human and financial \nresources to institutions and mechanisms that already \nexist, within and outside the United Nations system, \nfor conflict prevention and resolution. \n Going forward, I would like to propose the \nestablishment, under the Secretary-General\u2019s Office, of \na conflict mediation commission, to be charged, among \nother things, with collating information on conflict \nsituations across the world, identifying the dramatis \n \n \n45 11-50692 \n \npersonae and developing appropriate strategies for \ninitiating the resolution of such conflicts. The \ncommission would also develop rules of engagement, \nincluding sanctions that would apply to those who may \nobstruct efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully. \n This naturally brings me to the issue of \ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons. If the idea \nof resolving conflicts through mediation is to succeed, \nthen the problem of trafficking in small arms and light \nweapons must be frontally tackled. The proliferation of \nsmall arms and light weapons is particularly \nworrisome, due to their easy accessibility and \navailability to unauthorized persons and groups, who in \nturn have used these arms to create instability and \ninsecurity in most of the countries of the developing \nworld. Even worse, the proliferation of these weapons \nhas proved handy in the hands of terrorists. \n This explains our commitment to, and \npreoccupation with, the actualization of an arms trade \ntreaty that robustly addresses the illicit trade in small \narms and light weapons, which, as we all know, are \namong the major causes of destabilization and conflict \nin Africa. The danger of the proliferation of, and illicit \ntrade in, small arms and light weapons informed \nNigeria\u2019s decision to sponsor resolution 61/89, of 2006, \nthe principal objective being to provide a legally \nbinding international instrument for the trade in \nconventional arms. We will continue to support all \ninitiatives towards the realization of an arms trade \ntreaty in 2012. I call on all Member States to join in \nthis endeavour. \n The increasing rate of piracy and other maritime \ncrimes, with their attendant damaging effects on \nsecurity, trade and economic activities in the Gulf of \nGuinea and other locations, calls for coordinated \nregional and global approaches. In this respect, I would \nlike to express support for the proposal of the \nSecretary-General to deploy a United Nations \nassessment mission to study the situation in the Gulf of \nGuinea and explore possible options for United \nNations support and action. Our expectation is that a \npositive outcome from such a strategy will benefit not \nonly our subregion but the larger international \ncommunity as well. I am already consulting with other \nleaders in our subregion to boost this initiative. \n The United Nations strategy for gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment, especially through the \ncreation of UN-Women, deserves commendation and \nsupport. Nigeria\u2019s support for UN-Women, to which \nwe have made substantial contributions, reflects our \ndesire to harness the potential of women in the task of \nnation-building. \n Our national action plan on gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment places strong emphasis on \nwomen\u2019s effective participation in politics and \nadequate representation in public office. I am indeed \nproud to announce to the Assembly that more than \n30 per cent of my Cabinet is made up of women. Let \nme also commend the Executive Board of UN-Women \non the successful take-off of the entity. UN-Women can \nbe assured of Nigeria\u2019s strong support. \n This year, the prevention of non-communicable \ndiseases was one of the issues slated for discussion at a \nHigh-level Meeting. Only three months ago, I attended \nthe High-level Meeting on AIDS, where I pledged \nNigeria\u2019s commitment to health care, as part of our \ncountry\u2019s human capital development agenda. My \nGovernment is intensifying efforts to improve national \nhealth-care delivery by allocating substantial resources \nto primary health care. We look forward to a \nproductive outcome to the High-level Meeting on the \nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable \nDiseases at the end of that meeting.  \n In the same vein, I welcome discussions at the \nHigh-level Meeting on desertification and land \ndegradation, as these issues continue to pose \nchallenges to our development efforts. That is why \nNigeria strongly supports the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \nConvention on Biological Diversity, including \nstrategies and best practices to address this challenge. \n In order to demonstrate our commitment to \nhuman rights, Nigeria recently ratified the Convention \non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and acceded \nto four other international human rights instruments, \nincluding the Optional Protocol to the Convention \nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment.  \n In addition, this year, my Government passed into \nlaw the National Human Rights Commission \nAmendment Act, the Legal Aid Council Amendment \nAct and the Freedom of Information Act. Nigeria will \ncontinue to accord the highest priority to human rights \nissues, as they speak directly to the dignity and \ninalienable rights of humankind. \n  \n \n11-50692 46 \n \n We in West Africa are passing through an exciting \nseason of democratic rebirth. Before the end of 2011, \nelections will have been held in six countries in West \nAfrica. Those elections will set the respective countries \nalong the path of political stability, progress, good \ngovernance and sustainable development \u2014 some of \nthe benefits of which we have begun to experience. \nThe progress we have made would not have been \npossible without the support of the United Nations. \n The resolution of the conflict in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is a \ncase in point. I consider the inauguration of President \nOuattara a success not just for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire but also \nfor the international community, which spoke with one \nvoice and acted in concert in support of the Ivorian \npeople. The end of that crisis must be seen by all as the \nbeginning of our journey towards the consolidation of \ndemocratic culture and good governance in Africa. \nHaving put that crisis behind us, the international \ncommunity must now provide robust assistance to the \ncountry as it embarks on the tasks of post-conflict \nreconstruction and national reconciliation. \n The struggle for self-governance and majority \nrule in Africa started in the 1940s; and by 1957 Ghana \nhad gained independence. Today, all African States \nhave achieved self-determination and majority rule. \nThose are no small achievements. But we still have \nmuch work to do. A great deal of the work that remains \nis to build viable and capable States in Africa on the \nprinciples of popular participation, the rule of law and \nrespect for human rights, as we pledged to do in the \nConstitutive Act of the African Union. Nigeria believes \nthat those values must remain at the core of governance \nin Africa if we are ever to achieve the goals of stability, \nsecurity and development. \n As Nigeria is approaching the end of its tenure on \nthe Security Council, I would like to express my \ncountry\u2019s deep appreciation for the opportunity to serve \nin that important organ. In the course of our \nstewardship, the Council had the courage to reach \nmany difficult decisions that resulted in positive \ndevelopments around the world. We are proud to be \nassociated with those decisions. I would like to urge \nthe Council to continue its important work in the \nmaintenance of international peace and security.  \n In spite of the Council\u2019s many successes, it is our \nbelief that that important organ would benefit from the \nvigour and fresh perspectives that only a revamped \nCouncil accommodating changing global political \nrealities can provide. I urge the President of the \nGeneral Assembly to set up clear criteria for the reform \nof the Security Council in line with the demand of the \nmajority of the world. A reformed Security Council is \nthe only way to demonstrate that all nations have an \nequal stake in the United Nations. Nigeria looks \nforward to the prospect of membership in a reformed \nSecurity Council."

        "file_text": "Let me take this opportunity \nto congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral on his appointment to a second term. We \nSomalis would like to thank him for his leadership in \nputting Somalia at the top of the agenda despite so \nmany competing priorities. We hope that Somalia will \nbecome peaceful and stable during his tenure. \n It is my honour to address the General Assembly \nfor the first time as Prime Minister of Somalia. I come \nhere mindful of the enormous challenges at this \nimportant moment in our history and determined to act \n \n \n19 11-51372 \n \nboldly in the cause of peace, justice and stability \u2014 not \nonly in the Horn of Africa but on the African continent \nat large and in the world as a whole. \n The United Nations was founded on the \nconviction that the nations of the world could come \ntogether in a spirit of cooperation to tackle their \ncommon problems for the sake of the whole of \nhumankind. I wish to speak of the challenges facing \nSomalia, whose effects have found ample expression in \nthe current dire situation in the country, and some of \nwhich threaten every country represented here. \n Let me take this opportunity to thank the Prime \nMinister of Turkey for his genuine leadership and for \nhighlighting the plight and suffering of those affected \nby the famine in Somalia. The seemingly unending \nhumanitarian crisis in Somalia has many and varied \ncauses. Decades of conflict, the demise of the central \nState, poor and kleptocratic leadership and struggles \nbetween clans for limited resources, exacerbated by \ncycles of devastating droughts, have created chronic \nfood shortages and an underdeveloped economy, and \ndriven the population to despair. \n In recent years, the global terrorist organization \nAl-Qaida has sought to exploit these divisions and \nweaknesses to plot and carry out attacks on the rest of \nthe world. Our people know only too well the \ndestruction that a few, blinded by an ideology of \nextremism and terror, can wreak on a country. It is this \nsmall minority, and primarily the Al-Qaida affiliated \ngroup Al-Shabaab, that is responsible for the famine \ncurrently spreading throughout the country, through \ntheir policies of systematically looting grain stores, \nforcibly recruiting and extorting farmers and their \nfamilies and preventing access by aid agencies to the \nmost affected regions in the south. \n However, the threat they pose is not limited to \nour borders. Foreign fighters have sought to export \ntheir noxious extremism to the rest of the Horn of \nAfrica, recruiting and sponsoring acts of terror in \nneighbouring countries such as Uganda, where last \nyear they murdered 76 innocent people. The insecurity \nthey have created in southern Somalia has led to a \nlarge influx of refugees into Kenya and Ethiopia, \nstraining resources and spreading instability across the \nregion. \n They are also actively planning to strike further \nafield. Just this week, one of the leaders of Al-Shabaab \nsaid that the group was committed to continuing its \nbattle against the Government of Somalia and was \nseeking to destroy both the United States and the \nUnited Nations. It is also well-known that Al-Shabaab \nhas been focusing its recruitment and radicalization \nefforts on Somali diasporas in Australia, Europe, \nCanada and the United States of America. \n Clearly, the battle against Al-Qaida is one in \nwhich we all have a stake, and in which we all \ntherefore have responsibilities. In Somalia, we have \nbeen doing what we can, within our limited resources, \nto fulfil our obligations in this regard. Barely a month \nafter United States forces killed Osama bin Laden, one \nof his most wanted deputies, Fazul Abdullah \nMohammed, was shot dead by Somali security forces \non the outskirts of Mogadishu. Shortly thereafter, with \nthe aid of African Union forces, the Somali National \nArmy succeeded in forcing the extremists to withdraw \nthe bulk of their forces from the capital. As a result, we \ncan now begin to provide needed humanitarian \nassistance to the city\u2019s ever-increasing population of \ninternally displaced persons, who are fleeing the areas \nstill held by the extremists where the famine has hit \nhardest. \n Although the extremists\u2019 retreat from Mogadishu \nis a welcome development, it may herald a new and \nmore dangerous phase of the conflict, as they \nincreasingly turn to asymmetric tactics such as suicide \nbombings and the use of improvised explosive devices \nthat target the civilian population. As we continue to \nbuild up our own capacities, our security agencies are \nalert to this threat and have already successfully \ndisrupted a number of planned attacks, including \nseveral targeting the hungry at feeding centres. \n Terrorism preys on decaying States, exploiting \ntheir poverty and ungoverned spaces to radicalize, \nrecruit and plan. That is why the extremists have \nconsistently fought against the Somali peace process \nand sought to destroy the institutions it has generated. \nSomalia\u2019s leaders are redoubling their efforts to \nachieve national reconciliation and entrench \ndemocratic governance. Three weeks ago, with the help \nof our international partners, we hosted the first \nnational consultative conference in Mogadishu, at \nwhich the Transitional Institutions and representatives \nof regional administrations came together to adopt a \nroad map for the re-establishment of permanent, \nlegitimate and representative Government in the \ncountry. \n  \n \n11-51372 20 \n \n The conference, which was the culmination of \nSomali-led reconciliation initiatives dating back to the \nArta Declaration of May 2000, represents the best hope \nfor Somalia to establish a firm political foundation \nfrom which to rebuild. The road map is a significant \nachievement for the Somali peace process. Its adoption \nmarks the first of many steps on the path to the \neventual conclusion of the transition process in a \nresponsible and productive manner. It has also shed \nlight on the remaining transitional tasks, including the \ndrafting and promulgation of a new Constitution. The \nTransitional Federal Institutions have committed to \nmeeting the specific timelines and benchmarks for their \nimplementation as outlined in the road map, which will \nallow the Somali people to monitor our performance in \nthis regard. \n The support of the international community is \nalso crucial to ensuring its success. Indeed, the \nconference itself could not have taken place without \nthe continued engagement of the international \ncommunity. Let me also take this opportunity to \nexpress gratitude, on behalf of my entire nation, to the \nAfrican Union, and especially Uganda and Burundi, for \nthe support they have given and the sacrifices they \nhave made to date in this worthy cause. The fact that \nthe conference was safely held in Mogadishu is \ntestimony to the achievements in security that their \nforces have made possible in the city. I must also thank \nall the countries represented here for the bilateral and \nmultilateral support given to both the Transitional \nInstitutions and the African Union Mission in Somalia \n(AMISOM), without which none of what has been \nachieved would have been possible. \n Going forward, as we embark on the final leg of \nthe transition process, we will continue to need the \nhelp and support of the United Nations. The road map \nhas illuminated the path and, although dangers may lie \nin the shadows, we will not deviate from it. We ask that \nthe Organization continue to accompany us on this \njourney and to provide the needed resources as we \nadvance towards full sovereignty. \n Despite the remarkable progress we have made so \nfar, our gains remain fragile and consolidating them \nwill require resilience and unity from all. It is critical \nthat the Somali Army and AMISOM be reinforced as \nsoon as possible, so they can prevent a security \nvacuum in the areas of Mogadishu recently vacated by \nthe fleeing extremists, and ensure that the city is safe \nfor both residents and aid workers. The immediate \ndeployment of the extra 3,000 AMISOM troops already \nauthorized by the Security Council will be a crucial \nfirst step. \n In addition, we must also begin to show the \npeople the fruits of peace and democracy and to \nreverse the harmful effects of radicalization. Somalia \nneeds the help of the outside world to rebuild its \neconomy and provide jobs for the millions of our \nyoung people who have been deprived of opportunities \nby the anarchy of the past two decades. We must show \nthem that there is a better alternative to the barrel of a \ngun. \n The effort must begin at home. Let me be the first \nto acknowledge that we Somalis have made mistakes in \nthe past, which eroded the international community\u2019s \ntrust in our institutions. Somalia can and must do \nbetter. In this time of national crisis, we the Somali \npeople must set aside our differences and come \ntogether to confront our perils. Reconciliation must \nbecome our mantra as we work to further the peace \nprocess and create an environment conducive to the \ndelivery of aid. We in the political class must also \naccept our responsibility for the errors of the past and \nresolve to do better. The Somali people have had \nenough of war, hunger, political wrangling and \ncorruption. They demand, and indeed deserve, a \nGovernment that puts the national interest before \npersonal ambition \u2014 one that fosters unity, not \ndivision. \n The Transitional Federal Government is making \nefforts to reverse this and to instil a sense of patriotism \nand responsibility. We are making good progress in \ninjecting professionalism and transparency into the \nrevenue collection and economic management system, \nstrengthening internal mechanisms governing the \ndistribution of Government money and creating a more \nopen and accountable fiscal and monetary system.  \n The Central Bank of Somalia is up and running. \nThe economic reforms we have made have resulted in \nthe doubling of revenue from the Mogadishu seaport \nand quadrupled those from the Aden International \nAirport. The funds are being reinvested in the \nprovision of services to the people as our current \ncapability allows. For example, 15 per cent of the \nrevenue collected from the seaport has been set aside \nfor the rehabilitation of the city. As a result, for the \nfirst time in 20 years, Mogadishu is being cleared of \nrubble, roads are being repaired and streets lit, and \n \n \n21 11-51372 \n \nmarkets, hospitals and schools are reopening. A register \ncontaining the names and biometric data of all the \nmembers of the security forces has been compiled, and \nour soldiers are receiving their allowances regularly. \n As required by the road map, we have also \nembarked on the process of identifying nominees for \nthe Interim Independent Anti-Corruption Commission. \nWe are also formulating a national fiscal budget for the \ncoming fiscal year. \n As with the gains in the security sector, in order \nto entrench and safeguard these reforms and to deliver \non the expectations of the Somali people, we in the \nTransitional Federal Government must improve on our \nperformance and create the necessary conditions for \nthe growth of the Somali economy. However, the scale \nof the challenge is such that we will continue to rely on \nthe help of our international partners.  \n It is understandable that, in the prevailing global \neconomic environment, many in the wealthier countries \nwill be tempted to look to their own problems, to the \ndetriment of providing aid and investment to their \npoorer cousins in the developing world. I would \ncaution against this. The visionaries who founded this \nbody understood that it was impossible to secure \neconomic benefits for a section of the global \npopulation as long as these remained a distant dream \nfor the rest, and sought to establish an interlinked \nglobal political and economic infrastructure that \nensured that citizens in every country could participate \nin, and partake of the fruits of, global prosperity. I \ntherefore urge the international community to continue \nits generous support for the emerging economic \ninstitutions, as we strive to rebuild destroyed \ninfrastructure and jump-start economic activity in the \nareas our forces are securing. \n To the business community I would say that \nSomalia is truly Africa\u2019s sleeping giant, and a \nrelatively small investment there will go a long way. \nWith the longest coastline on the continent, bountiful \nand unexploited natural wealth and an entrepreneurial \ntradition that dates back to the Roman times, a peaceful \nSomalia will be a force for moderation and an engine \nof growth and prosperity for the region and for the \ncontinent.  \n Furthermore, the integration of Somalia into the \nglobal economy will have a considerable and beneficial \nimpact on the phenomenon of piracy from our shores, \nwhich imposes huge costs on global trade. As has been \nnoted by many observers, a lasting solution to this \nmenace is not to be found in policing the high seas. \nThe regeneration of a vibrant economy on land, \nproviding jobs and opportunity for all, is the sole \nantidote.  \n The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains \ndire. The United Nations has declared famine in a sixth \nregion, which means that up to half the population is \nnow facing the prospect of starvation. Many of our \npeople continue to come to the capital seeking refuge, \nwith more than half a million others having already \narrived. To deal with this situation and to oversee the \ndelivery of humanitarian assistance, a high-level \ncommittee has been created. As per its \nrecommendations, the Government has established \nseveral camps to house and feed refugees. A disaster \nmanagement agency, comprised of members of civil \nsociety, has also been established. We are working with \nUnited Nations agencies such as the Office for the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Office of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and \nthe World Food Programme to synchronize our efforts \nto deal with the famine. \n On behalf of the entire Somali nation, I wish to \nexpress my gratitude for the pledges of assistance that \nwe have received from Governments and humanitarian \nagencies around the world. The greatest need, however, \ncontinues to be felt within areas still under the \neffective control of the extremists, where access by \ninternational humanitarian agencies is severely \nrestricted. The insurgents are also hampering the \nfreedom of movement of millions who are trying to \nreach help, either in Mogadishu or in neighbouring \ncountries. \n Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair. \n Without urgent interventions to change the \nsituation, it is estimated that up to three quarters of a \nmillion people may perish in the next few months. \nAlthough normal to above-normal rainfall is expected \nto return in the next three months, that is unlikely to \nresult in a significant easing of the crisis in the short \nterm, since the harvest will not be expected until \nFebruary. In any case, the production from the short \nrainy season only accounts for a third of the total \nannual cereal production. The displacement of farmers \nby the current famine will only further reduce the \nexpected yield. In fact, the United Nations has \n  \n \n11-51372 22 \n \nindicated that it expects the famine to spread to the rest \nof the south by the end of the year. \n It is therefore critical that we accelerate efforts to \nreach those in Al-Shabaab-controlled areas, while at \nthe same time ensuring that international humanitarian \nworkers are afforded a measure of security against \nattacks and kidnappings by the insurgents. As I noted \nearlier, the international community must urgently \nreinforce our efforts to extend the zone of safety for aid \nworkers beyond Mogadishu and into these areas. In the \nmeantime, my Government will continue to work \nclosely with humanitarian agencies to collect and share \ninformation on needs. We stand ready to cooperate \nwith all actors to ensure that aid gets to the most \ncritically affected populations, wherever they may be. \n As I stated before, the challenges I have outlined \nhave been aggravated by the increasing cycles of \ndevastating drought that we experience as a result of \nchanges in global climate patterns. We in the Horn of \nAfrica have been affected more than most. As I speak, \nthe region is experiencing its worst drought in a \ngeneration. The scale of the suffering in my country is \na testament to price we are having to pay. \n There needs to be a concerted effort not just to \naddress the causes of climate change but also to \nmitigate its adverse effects, especially in countries such \nas Somalia that have contributed little to the problem \nbut are bearing the brunt of its consequences. In that \nregard, let me reiterate the appeal issued during the \nrecent summit on the Horn of Africa crisis, held in the \nKenyan capital, Nairobi, for developed nations to \nfacilitate the transfer of technology and build up the \ncapacity of developing nations to adapt to these \nchallenges. Somalia will require assistance to improve \nwater resource management and reduce our reliance on \nrain-fed agriculture even as we strive to implement the \ntargets agreed to at the Nairobi summit of 10 per cent \nforest cover and irrigated land by the year 2017. \n Moreover, we fully support the right of Palestine \nto become a full member of the community of nations. \nWe believe in the two-State solution for the \nPalestinian-Israeli problem, where Palestinians should \nbe allowed to live in peace and dignity in their own \nhomeland. We have all seen the changes happening in \nthe Arab world. The international community must \nsupport the peaceful and democratic aspirations of all \npeoples.  \n We must also support the National Transitional \nCouncil of Libya in order to bring peace and stability \nto that country. \n In conclusion, today, the future of Somalia hangs \nin the balance, and with it the prospects for peace, \nstability and prosperity in the Horn of Africa and \nsecurity for nations across the world. Resolute global \naction in support of our efforts is now required if we \nare to consolidate and build on the gains already made \nand extend them to the rest of the country for the sake \nof future generations."

I am fully \nconfident that, given his renowned experience and \nwisdom, he will ably execute the functions of his \nposition. I wish him every success in his work. I would \nlike to express our thanks and appreciation to \nMr. Joseph Deiss for his constructive efforts in \npresiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. \n \n \n13 11-51670 \n \n Our thanks also go to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \ndeserved re-election as Secretary-General of the United \nNations. We wish to express our thanks and \nappreciation to him, as well as to the entire Secretariat \nstaff for their work over the past year, in particular for \ntheir follow-up of the situation in my country. \n We wish to congratulate the people of the \nRepublic of South Sudan on that country\u2019s \nestablishment and accession to the United Nations. We \nalso wish to congratulate the National Transitional \nCouncil of Libya for its presence among us and for its \nrepresentation of the brotherly Libyan people. \n Since January, my country has been experiencing \nan acute political crisis. The political opposition that \nhas been one of the main components of our system \nsince the unified State of Yemen was established in \nMay 1990 decided to relinquish all common \ndenominators and rejected the principle of consensus, \nrefusing to implement the agreement reached since \n2006 following its defeat in the presidential elections. \nIt has created crises, raising its demands and rejecting \nall compromises and solutions. Realizing that \ndemocratic means would not enable it to seize power, \nthe opposition resorted to political manoeuvres, \nincluding violence, threatening the outbreak of civil \nwar and complete devastation in Yemen. That could \nundermine all the achievements of the Yemeni people \nin the modern era, as well as their struggle to establish \na democratic political system and to protect their \nnational identity, social fabric, unique human harmony \nand the system that we have managed to build. \n At the beginning of the 1990s, Yemen\u2019s national \nmovement made great progress by establishing a \nunified State of Yemen, founded on pluralistic \ndemocratic principles and coupled with various civil \ninstitutions that promoted and respected human rights. \nHowever, those who wished narrow, individual and \npartisan interests to prevail did not support that historic \nachievement. Therefore, they tried to stir up trouble, \nusing the conflicts and mistakes made in Yemen in the \nearly days of our unified State, as well as the \nchallenges to development \u2014 the uncontrolled \npopulation growth, the prevailing poverty, the lack of \nnational resources, increasing drought and \ndesertification, and the scarce water and oil resources, \nwhich were the main source of income.  \n All those factors have made it impossible for \nthousands of university graduates to find employment, \nwhich has led to social and political tensions and \nfrustration. But all the opposition forces used the tidal \nwave of change witnessed by Arab countries to prevent \nYemen from achieving democratic change through \nelections. However, we respected young people\u2019s \ndemand for change and started a dialogue with them in \norder to meet their demands for reform. We have \ncreated tens of thousands of jobs in order to alleviate \nunemployment.  \n However, the opposition parties abused and \nmisused the protests of our young people in order to \nseize power, and some of their elements have carried \nout subversive acts to sabotage the youth movement \nand its just demands. The opposition parties rejected \nthe results of the democratic elections that were \nconducted under the international monitoring of the \nEuropean Union, the Democratic National Institute and \nseveral international organizations, which verified that \nthe elections were fair, democratic and transparent. \n Our Government showed its readiness to meet the \nrequests of our young people and their legitimate \ndemands to build a better future for us and for \nprosperity \u2014 a future that is hindered by my country\u2019s \nweak economy, limited national resources and the \nprevalence of poverty and unemployment, as well as by \nterrorism and the repercussions of the global financial \ncrisis. Our Government kept on calling on our \ndevelopment partners and friends and international \norganizations to provide financial and economic \nsupport in order to achieve sustainable development in \nYemen, which would ensure security and stability in \nour country. \n The main reason for, and primary cause of, the \ncurrent upheaval in Yemen is the dissatisfaction of the \nopposition and its refusal to endorse the election that \ntook place in 2006. In that election our people showed \nconfidence in the President of the Republic and chose \nhim as our President. The opposition\u2019s rejection of that \nprocess has led to the crisis that we are witnessing \ntoday at the economic, development, security and \npolitical levels.  \n Despite the intransigence of the opposition, the \nPresident of the Republic offered compromise in order \nto achieve reconciliation between the opposition and \nthe Government. That has led to the postponement of \nparliamentary elections for two years. However, the \nefforts of our President continue through his initiatives \nbefore Parliament and the Consultative Council, \n  \n \n11-51670 14 \n \nwhereby he affirmed that he had no intention of \nrunning in the presidential elections and that he \naccepted the amendments to the Constitution and the \nelectoral law, as well as an entire package of political \nreforms. \n Our country has incurred heavy losses, estimated \nat more than $2 billion, as a result of the chaos caused \nby the opposition parties, which have tried to cut off \nroads, blow up oil pipelines and cut power lines in \nmany of our cities, in particular in the capital, Ta\u2019izz, \nAden and Abyan. However, the Government continued \nto seek a peaceful solution to the political crisis, \ncalling on the opposition to come to the table and begin \ndialogue. We in Yemen are confident that the recent \ndivision will be overcome by returning to \nconstitutional legality and remedying certain \nshortcomings. \n The Government offered a new opportunity for \ndialogue by endorsing the initiative of the Gulf \nCooperation Council (GCC) as the foundation for a \nsolution to the political crisis, especially given that His \nExcellency President Ali Abdullah Saleh decided to \nentrust his Vice-President with all constitutional \npowers, to initiate dialogue with the signatories of the \nGulf initiative and to create a mechanism that would \nguarantee a smooth and democratic transfer of power. \nThat would allow for reconciliation, reform, change \nand reconstruction in Yemen without any violation of \nsecurity, the Constitution or democratic principles. \n We believe that Yemen, as a country that opted \nfor dialogue as a means of overcoming the political \ncrisis, will provide a model for change in which all \nparties are winners and the status of women is \nenhanced. The President, following his return to \nSana\u2019a, declared in no uncertain terms that he \nsupported the GCC initiative and was committed to it. \nHe called on all parties to initiate dialogue and to reach \na compromise with a view to its implementation. \n My country is continuing to make every effort to \nfight Al-Qaida and its terrorist acts in our country \ndespite our Government\u2019s limited resources. We have \ndealt some serious blows to Al-Qaida in Abyan \nprovince in recent weeks. What we need at the \ninternational level is an integrated global strategy that \nwould help us build our national capacities and thereby \nenable us to fight extremism and terrorist ideology. \nSuch a strategy would not involve military force only \nbut would be of a social, educational and political \nnature and would strive to eradicate poverty and \nachieve universal justice. \n The Republic of Yemen attaches primary \nimportance to human rights, which is one of the main \npillars of the United Nations. Since the return of unity \nto Yemen in 1990, my country has made great strides in \nthis area. We have established a Ministry for Human \nRights and have become a signatory and party to a \nnumber of international human rights instruments and \nconventions, on whose implementation we submit \nperiodic reports. We have also submitted our national \nreports within the context of the universal periodic \nreview of the Human Rights Council, with which we \ncooperate. \n In that connection, we welcome the outcome of \nthe review conducted by the Human Rights Council in \nGeneva and New York, in which we participated \nactively. There is no doubt that during the political \ncrisis many human rights violations have been \ncommitted by all parties. The Government nonetheless \nshowed a readiness to conduct independent national \ninvestigations and to bring the perpetrators to justice. \nThe Government also opened its doors to the fact-\nfinding mission sent by the Human Rights Council. In \nresponse to an invitation by our Government, the \nmission visited Yemen in July and submitted its report \nto the Council on 19 September. However, my country \nbelieves that resolving the political crisis is the key to \nstopping all violations of human rights. \n The Government of Yemen, during its \nchairmanship of the Group of 77 and China in 2010, \ncontinued to actively and sincerely work to achieve \nconsensus and unity within the Group, which led to a \nconsensus on many issues of interest to the Group, \nincluding, inter alia, climate change, the outcome \ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on the Millennium Development \nGoals, and United Nations reform. In that connection, \nwe wish every success to the Republic of Argentina \nduring its chairmanship of the Group. We also wish \nevery success to the fraternal Republic of Algeria, \nwhich will chair the Group in 2012. \n The Israeli-Arab conflict represents the main \nthreat to international peace and security. An objective \nunderstanding of the conflict clearly shows Israel\u2019s \nintransigence and its Government\u2019s policy of \nestablishing settlements, its rejection of the legitimate \nand inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, its \n \n \n15 11-51670 \n \nrefusal to abide by international legality, and its \nrejection of the Arab Peace Initiative. We call upon the \ninternational community and the peace sponsors, \nincluding the United States of America, to continue \ntheir efforts to achieve universal recognition of a \nsovereign State of Palestine and to allow it to join the \nUnited Nations as a fully fledged Member of the \nOrganization and other world organizations and organs. \n Allow me in closing to reiterate my thanks to the \nSecretary-General for his efforts in following the crisis \nin Yemen. I wish also to thank all the United Nations \nagencies for their humanitarian efforts in my country \nduring this political crisis."

        "file_text": "I would like to \ncongratulate the President on his assumption of the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. We are confident that his extensive diplomatic \nexperience will inform his leadership at this session. I \nassure him of my delegation\u2019s full support.  \n During the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly, we benefited from the skilled leadership of \nHis Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss. I wish to recognize \nhis sterling contribution to the work of that session. \n We join others in welcoming the newest Member \nof the United Nations family \u2014 the Republic of South \nSudan. The emergence of South Sudan as a sovereign \nState underscores the fundamental value and relevance \nof the theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly session, \nnamely, \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means\u201d. We salute the tenacity of \nthe people of South Sudan in their struggle to gain \nstatehood after five decades of conflict. We urge all \nsides and factions not to allow rivalries and revenge to \nimpede growth and development. The international \ncommunity must assist South Sudan as it embarks on \nthe daunting journey of stabilization and nation \nbuilding. \n We look out at a global political landscape that is \nmarked by turbulence and uncertainty. The \ndevelopments over the past several months in the \nMiddle East and North Africa in particular are stark \nreminders that the legitimate aspirations of citizens for \n  \n \n11-51384 28 \n \nfreedom, inclusive Government and respect for human \nrights cannot be indefinitely suppressed. \n Longstanding disputes and pockets of political \ninstability and conflict continue to fester in several \nparts of the world, resulting in social and economic \ndislocation and humanitarian crises. If the United \nNations is to effectively respond to those situations of \nconflict, its preventive diplomacy capacity, including \nmediation capacity, must be strengthened. \n Many conflicts have their roots in racial and \nreligious intolerance, resulting in social exclusion, \nmarginalization and the alienation of people. The High-\nlevel Meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of \nthe adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme \nof Action against racism, racial discrimination, \nxenophobia and related intolerance, obliged us to \nreflect on the global community\u2019s inadequate \ncompliance with the objectives of the Programme of \nAction. Recognizing the danger in such situations of \npotential conflict and providing full support for the \nProgramme are congruent with the principles implied \nin the theme for this session of the General Assembly. \n Related to that is the continued support of the \ninternational community for the project to erect a \npermanent memorial to the victims of slavery and the \ntrans-Atlantic slave trade, as a visible message of the \nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action. Jamaica \nthanks all those countries that have contributed to the \nerection of the memorial and looks forward to its \ncompletion within a reasonable time frame. \n Peace and development are mutually reinforcing \nand intrinsically linked to growth and prosperity. It is \ntherefore important that we consciously seek to \nstrengthen and support the role of the Peacebuilding \nCommission, recognizing the linkages between \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding and the transition \nfrom stabilization to consolidation. \n The resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \nis long overdue. It is time to end the occupation of \nPalestinian territory. It is time for the people of \nPalestine and Israel to live in peace and mutual \nsecurity. Jamaica remains unwavering in its support for \na just, lasting and comprehensive agreement that \nrecognizes the Palestinian State within the pre-1967 \nborders and guarantees the security of Israel. The focus \nmust now be on ending the stalemate and reviving \ndirect negotiations between Israel and Palestine. In that \nregard, Jamaica welcomes the declarations to the \nGeneral Assembly by both Palestine and Israel of their \nreadiness to do so. \n Both sides must now re-engage in good faith, \ntaking no action that could undermine the possibility of \na durable solution. Central to that must be Israel\u2019s \ncessation of settlement building and expansion in the \noccupied territories and, on the part of the Palestinian \nleadership and people, the renunciation of violence \nagainst Israel and acceptance of its right to exist. The \ndoor to peaceful negotiations will not be forever open, \nnor can there be a continuing delay to Palestine\u2019s \nassumption of its rightful place in the global \ncommunity of States. \n The spread of globalization is well advanced, and \nour economies and growth prospects are interlinked in \na vast network of economic opportunities. In these \ndifficult financial times, developing countries are \nforced to take painful policy decisions aimed at \nrecalibrating our economic plans to address immediate \nchallenges while laying the groundwork for the \nfulfilment of our long-term development goals.  \n The balancing act that this involves can have dire \nconsequences for our most vulnerable nationals. We all \nhave to take ownership of our own development \nprocess and the necessary steps to provide an economic \nenvironment that is conducive to growth and \nprosperity. To that end, we are compelled to adopt \napproaches that are innovative, pro-active and \ncollaborative. It is through adopting such approaches \nthat many countries and regions have made significant \ninroads in the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n I wish to refer to the struggles of two \nneighbouring Caribbean countries to achieve \ndevelopment. Haiti, in the wake of its disruptive \ndisaster, and in line with its successful efforts for \npolitical organization, needs the continued support of \nthe international community to foster its development, \nif its democratic gains are to be consolidated. Cuba \nmust have the space to foment its own development, \nfree from the decades-long embargo that has slowed its \ngrowth, but not its will to improve the welfare of its \npeople and that of other developing countries. A strong \nCuban economy, integrated into the Caribbean \nmarketplace, is essential to the region\u2019s development. \n We are faced with the reality that, although we all \noperate in one global economy, with the same \naspirations for growth and sustainable development, \n \n \n29 11-51384 \n \nwe do not all have the same resources or capabilities. \nIn addition to being acutely vulnerable to the vagaries \nof the global economic environment, the development \nprospects of many developing countries are frequently \nundermined by environmental degradation and climate \nchange.  \n Classifications that are ostensibly positive, such \nas our own designation as an upper-middle-income \ncountry, serve to obscure several of the development \nchallenges that we continue to face, particularly in \naccessing development financing and assistance, which \nare critical to our development process and the \nattainment of the MDGs. The range of socio-economic \ncharacteristics and levels of development of countries \nthat fall in the middle-income category is indicative of \nthe need for us to move towards harmonization of the \ncriteria used in classification and resources allocation. \n Developing countries like ours have undertaken \npainful adjustments to achieve fiscal discipline and \nmacroeconomic stability within an open economy. We \ncontinue to pursue free trade agreements at the \nregional, hemispheric and global levels. However, the \nmissing link to progress is the urgent need to build \ncapacities in developing countries through \ninfrastructure development, institution-building and \nexpanding and enhancing productive capacity for \ncompetitiveness and to meet international quality \nstandards.  \n Moving from an economy primarily driven by \ncommodities to one that is value-added, knowledge-\nbased, innovative and technology-driven is a \ntransformation that, although challenging for \ndeveloping countries, must be achieved. Without \neffective partnerships between the large and small \neconomies for mutual benefit, balanced trade and \nshared growth, that is unlikely to occur.  \n I speak here positively of the increasing South-\nSouth cooperation that offers hope to many developing \ncountries. We have long recognized that we can \nmaximize our growth prospects through increased \neconomic partnerships and investment opportunities, \nwhich ultimately lead to improvements in trade \nrelations. Indeed, the reality is that development aid is \nan essential resource, which is used by developing \ncountries to offset the financial burden involved in the \nexecution of major development projects.  \n Unfortunately, much development aid and \nassistance to developing countries continue to fall short \nof the agreed goal of 0.7 per cent of gross national \nincome, as some of our developed partners fail to meet \ntheir commitments. Closing the gap between \ncommitment to development and the provision of \nresources that will facilitate the implementation of its \nvarious components requires political courage. We \ncommend those partners who have maintained or \nexceeded their official development assistance targets \ndespite their own economic challenges. \n We continue to count on the support of our \npartners and the international community to help drive \nour social and development goals and to keep our \nsafety nets in place. International financial and \ndevelopment assistance help to strengthen our \ndevelopment process and to address setbacks from \nexternal shocks on our economic planning and social \ninvestments. Development funding is critical in the \nrecovery of our agricultural, mining and tourism \nindustries, which are often adversely affected by \nclimate change and the impact of natural disasters. So, \ntoo, are the transfer of technology and capacity \nbuilding. \n We urge our partners to recommit to the \ndevelopment agenda, both here at the United Nations \nand within the context of the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions. We reiterate our call for the reform of the \ninternational financial institutions towards increased \ntransparency and accountability, and an increased role \nfor the developing countries in decision-making. \n We welcome the increased attention that the \nGroup of Twenty (G-20) has paid to development \nissues and are encouraged by the consultative approach \nin its relations with the United Nations. It is imperative \nthat the G-20\u2019s activities in respect of development \naccord with the central role of the United Nations in \neconomic development. \n The Doha Development Round of trade \nnegotiations, which began in good faith nearly a \ndecade ago, has the potential to significantly improve \nthe development prospects of most developing \ncountries. We therefore urge the full re-engagement of \nall parties in the process, so that we might move \nbeyond the current impasse and usher in a new era of \nmultilateral trade relations. This must take into account \nthe preservation of policy space and flexibility for \ndeveloping countries in areas that are integral to our \nability to build competitiveness and trade capacity. We \nremain hopeful that at the eighth Ministerial \n  \n \n11-51384 30 \n \nConference, to be held in December, we will consider a \npackage of measures as the basis for a more balanced \ntrade regime that will serve as a catalyst for increased \neconomic growth and prosperity worldwide. We must \ncommit to ensuring that development remains a central \nobjective of the negotiations. \n We support coordinated and collaborative efforts \nwithin the context of the review and implementation of \nthe Aid for Trade Initiative in support of developing \ncountries. We will continue to work with our \ninternational partners and aid and development entities \nin expanding the Initiative to build on the supply-side \ncapacity and infrastructure of developing countries, so \nthat we can take advantage of trade opportunities and \nconnections within the global economy. \n Jamaica has embarked on an export-led trade \npolicy with the full involvement of the business sector \nwithin the context of the World Trade Organization \nTrade Policy Review institutional framework. The \nstrategic formulation of our trade policy process \nincludes collaboration with the private sector \nparticularly given its central role and expertise in \nmanufacturing and exporting. Our success in trade \ndevelopment is strongly dependent on partnerships \nwith the private sector as we agree to policy directives \nand pursue an export-led trade initiative, while being \nmindful of our resources and capacity to export, as \nwell as business opportunities and market intelligence \nglobally. \n Other critical challenges such as food security, \nenergy security, climate change, poverty and diseases, \ncontinue to demand the attention of the international \ncommunity. Precisely because of their transnational \ncharacter, many of these problems require multilateral \ncooperation and action in an inclusive framework that \ninvolves both developed and developing countries. \n A year ago, world leaders gathered at the General \nAssembly to take stock of the progress made towards \nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \nWe renewed our commitments to achieving those \ntargets by 2015. We acknowledge the support and \npartnership in the midst of the global economic \nchallenges. Nonetheless, with four years left until the \n2015 deadline, we are deeply concerned at the slow \npace of delivery on commitments made in several key \nareas, namely, ODA, trade, debt relief and access to \nnew technologies and affordable essential medicines. \n Jamaica renews the appeal made by our Prime \nMinister at the summit last year for an emergency \nprogramme to re-energize the MDG agenda. Without \nsuch a programme, those targets will remain elusive in \n2015 and beyond. The fiscal policy requirements \nattached to the resources made available for developing \ncountries through institutions like the International \nMonetary Fund cannot assist in meeting the MDG \ntargets in the short run. It is therefore critical that we \nreinvigorate the Global Partnership for Development \naligned with MDG 8. Critical also must be the \nchannelling of resources and the fiscal space to support \nprogrammes for economic empowerment and capacity \nbuilding. More concessionary loans and grants and \ndebt-for-equity swaps should be among the instruments \nused. \n Jamaica is on track to meet most of the MDGs \ndespite the economic and financial challenges. Through \nassistance from the Global Fund, we have significantly \nincreased access to antiretroviral drugs and reduced the \nrates of HIV/AIDS infection, mother-to-child \ntransmission and AIDS mortality. At the High-level \nMeeting on AIDS held in June, Member States \ncommitted to bold new targets for the AIDS response, \nincluding scaling up investments. As a result of its \nreclassification as an upper-middle-income country, \nJamaica will not be eligible to access those funds. This \nputs us at risk of reversing the gains made in halting \nthe spread of HIV. We again urge that the factors used \nby the relevant multilateral agencies in the \nmeasurement of a country\u2019s wealth be reviewed, as \ntheir classifications often bear no resemblance to the \nrealities on the ground. They must more carefully take \ninto account a country\u2019s indebtedness and capacity to \npay, as well as its fiscal capacity to finance \nprogrammes that are taken for granted in respect of \nmiddle-income countries. \n We are pleased that the international community \nembraced the proposal made by the Caribbean \nCommunity for United Nations emphasis on \nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs), the silent killer of \nmillions around the world. The High-level Meeting on \nNCDs last week allowed us for the first time to agree \nto measures to significantly reduce NCDs. The political \ndeclaration we adopted (resolution 66/2, annex), while \nnot as ambitious as Jamaica would have preferred, \nprovides a good basis to address the prevention and \ncontrol of NCDs. We urge the United Nations system \nand Member States to expeditiously implement \n \n \n31 11-51384 \n \nmeasures to achieve the agreed targets and indicators \non NCDs. \n The famine in the Horn of Africa, precipitated by \nthe worst drought in half a century, is of grave concern \nto us all. It has heightened our awareness of the \ndevastating impact of natural disasters on poor \ndeveloping countries. We must adopt more concrete \nmeasures on food security, building on the progress \nmade from the World Summit on Food Security and \nworking closely with the World Food Programme and \nthe United Nations Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs to strengthen international \nhumanitarian response and assistance, particularly in \nareas that are prone to disasters and conflicts. The \nplight of starving populations, including mothers and \ninfants in the region, must push us towards the \ncommitments of the World Food Summit Plan of \nAction. \n To sustain the global food market and feed our \npopulations, we have to engage in greater investments \nin science and research to boost agricultural \nproduction \u2014 especially in poor rural communities \u2014 \nas well as to offset the effect of drought and famine. \nWe equally have to increase investment in transport \nand agricultural infrastructure to facilitate the storage \nof food, its marketing and packaging and its \ntransportation to marketplaces. \n Speculative action in the global market, with the \nattendant volatility in commodity prices, has generated \nsocio-economic tensions in various countries across the \nglobe. The constant increases in food prices not only \ncreate further strain on the economy and on social \nwelfare, but also threaten food security and deepen the \neconomic challenges of countries that are already \nstriving to recover from the global financial crisis. \nJamaica therefore welcomes the initiative launched by \nPresident Sarkozy of France for the G-20 to give \nserious consideration to this question of financial \nspeculation in the prices of petroleum and food at the \nsummit to be held in November. This is a burgeoning \ncrisis, which the United Nations must also take \nseriously. \n Climate change presents a clear and present \ndanger to human development, particularly in small \nisland developing States and least developed States. \nProgress was made at the United Nations Climate \nChange Conference in Canc\u00fan last December, when \ncommon ground was reached between developed and \ndeveloping countries on several key issues. We must \nnow implement and operationalize those decisions. We \nremain disappointed at the slow pace of climate change \nfinancing. \n The United Nations Climate Change Conference \nin Durban in December will provide yet another \nopportunity to forge consensus on effective adaptation \nand mitigation strategies within the context of an \nambitious post-2012 climate change framework. A \nsecond commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol is \nessential, and we remain optimistic that at Durban we \nwill all demonstrate the necessary political will and \nseriousness of purpose to achieve that. \n At the United Nations we share a common \nbackground in the 1983 World Commission on \nEnvironment and Development and the 1987 report \n\u201cOur Common Future\u201d (A/42/427, annex). We share an \nawareness that the nations of the world are \ninterdependent, experience interlocking crises and have \na common but differently shaded responsibility. We \nhave agreed on the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto \nProtocol. We share the conviction that inequality, \npoverty and the environment and environmental \ndegradation are linked and that development and the \nenvironment are inseparable. In the light of that \nbackground, we urge a renewed commitment to the \npursuit of development that is sustainable, through \nincreased attention to all three pillars of sustainable \ndevelopment \u2014 the environmental, the socio-political \nand the economic \u2014 and a redoubling of efforts to \nintegrate sustainable development principles at the \ninternational, regional and, most important, national \nlevels, and  \n \u201cmeet[ing] the needs of the present without \ncompromising the ability of future generations to \nmeet their own needs\u201d. (A/42/427, annex, \nconclusion, para. 1) \n As a small island developing State, we have a \nvested interest in the successful outcome of the 2012 \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20) to review the implementation \nof the commitments made 20 years ago at the \nConference in Rio de Janeiro. States and regions are \nalready assessing the progress that we have made and \nthe gaps that persist in our efforts to chart a more \nsustainable course to development in the period since \nthe 1992 Conference. Significant gaps that cause \n  \n \n11-51384 32 \n \nconcern relate to the transfer of technology, capacity-\nbuilding and the provision of additional financial \nresources for development. \n In our efforts to strengthen the international \nsustainable development architecture, the emphasis \nshould be on effectiveness, on the efficacy of \ninstitutions that not only facilitate extensive policy \ndiscussions, but that also move us towards fulfilment \nof the ambitious vision that we all embraced in Rio in \n1992. We should also aim for institutional flexibility, \nwhich will allow us to address long-standing and \nemerging challenges through increased cooperation and \ncoordination. \n Rio+20 will provide us with an excellent \nopportunity to renew our commitment to Agenda 21, \nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and, in \nrespect of the small island developing States, the \nBarbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \nStrategy on its implementation. \n As host to the International Seabed Authority, \nJamaica attaches great importance to ocean affairs and \nthe law of the sea. Next year marks the thirtieth \nanniversary of the opening for signature of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, drawn up in \nMontego Bay. We encourage Member States to \nappropriately highlight that landmark event at the \ninternational level. \n The total elimination of nuclear weapons remains \nan important goal for the international community. \nWhile we have taken significant steps towards \nachieving that goal, significant challenges remain. A \nnumber of key players remain outside the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has still not \nentered into force. As we look towards the start of the \npreparatory process for the 2015 NPT Review \nConference, there must be unquestionable political will \nto address those lingering deficiencies in our push to \nachieve a world free of nuclear weapons. \n We must continue to build on the momentum \ngained from last year\u2019s special high-level meeting of \nthe General Assembly on transnational organized \ncrime, which addressed measures to counter the \ngrowing problem, including narco-trafficking and the \nillicit trade in small arms and ammunition. \n Jamaica, like its partners in the Caribbean \nCommunity, continues to face severe threats to our \nlong-term socio-economic development from illicit \ntrafficking in narcotic drugs, small arms and light \nweapons and ammunition. We will remain resolute in \nour fight against this menace both locally and abroad. \nWe have achieved marked reductions in crime and \ncriminal activities over the past year with our \nmultifaceted strategy to stem the problems, as well as \nthrough the implementation of social intervention and \nsocial transformation initiatives to stem the problem of \ncrime and violence. We continue to strengthen the \ncapacity of our security forces and to improve our \njustice system, to ensure that criminals are caught and \nprosecuted in a court of law.  \n We firmly believe, however, that we will not see \nthe full impact of those efforts without an international \nregime that regulates the sale and transfer of \nconventional weapons, in particular small arms and \nlight weapons and their ammunition. To that end, \nJamaica is committed to ensuring that the 2012 \nDiplomatic Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty \nresults in a legally binding, comprehensive, objective \nand transparent Treaty. \n In order for the United Nations to deliver on all \nour expectations, its organizational structure must \nreflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first \ncentury. An effective response to global challenges \nrequires a reformed and dynamic United Nations. \nReform initiatives, spanning a number of years, have \nled to the establishment of UN-Women, the reform and \nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council, a \nmore coordinated and efficient response to \nhumanitarian crises and a change in the way we \nconduct our peacekeeping missions. We must continue \nour efforts aimed at revitalizing the General Assembly \nso that it can effectively carry out its role and \nresponsibility as the chief deliberative and \npolicymaking organ of the United Nations. \n A glaring failure has been our inability to agree \non reform of the Security Council to ensure that it is \nmore democratic, responsive and reflective of today\u2019s \npolitical environment. For more than 15 years, the \ndebates for comprehensive and lasting reform of the \nCouncil have achieved very little. The African \ncountries and our Latin American and Caribbean region \nstill have no permanent seat at the table. That injustice \ncannot continue. Comprehensive reform can only be \nachieved within the intergovernmental negotiating \nprocess. Anything less will be nothing more than a \ncontinuation of the status quo. \n \n \n33 11-51384 \n \n As we continue to work together to achieve \nsustainable development for all, it is imperative that we \nexercise the requisite political will and make good on \nour commitments to the global development agenda. \nThe far-reaching effects of the multiple and \ninterconnected crises of recent years have reinforced \nour interdependence and the important role of \neconomic cooperation and partnerships in securing \nglobal peace and prosperity. \n We must redouble our efforts to address the \ngrowing challenges of poverty, food insecurity, the \nrising costs of food and energy, and climate change. It \nis not good enough to engage in extensive \ndeliberations, to make commitments and issue \ndeclarations without providing the means for their \nimplementation, including financing, capacity-building \nand technology transfer. We must now go beyond grand \nstatements if we are to fully realize sustainable \ndevelopment and rekindle the faith of the people we \nserve in the United Nations."

        "file_text": "Allow me \nat the outset to congratulate you, Sir, and our brothers, \nthe people of Qatar, on your election to the presidency \nof the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Our \ndelegation will be of assistance to you in the \nperformance of your duties, and we are confident that \nyour experience and wisdom will be an important \nfactor in the success of the Assembly\u2019s work. Our \nthanks also go to your predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, \nfor his presidency of the General Assembly at its \noutgoing session. I should also like to warmly \ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \non his appointment to a second term and wish him \nevery success in his work. \n It is an honour to stand in front of the Assembly \none more time to brief members on the most notable \ndevelopments that Iraq is witnessing as it works on \nbuilding a modern State that lives in peace and security \nwith its people and its neighbours. Iraq is building a \nhomeland where everyone lives in peace and stability \nregardless of sectarian, ethnic or factional affiliations; \na system where the rule of law prevails and human \nrights are respected; and a system that is based on \ndemocracy and the peaceful alternation of power. That \nis the basis for the path on which we have embarked \nand are continually implementing.  \n The events currently taking place in the Arab \nregion have proved the rightness of the path that we \nhave been following. The values of change and reform, \nwhich Iraq has called and will continue to call for, have \nbecome an essential part of the aspirations of the Arab \npeople for freedom and for their ability to choose their \nown political system on the basis of democracy and \nhuman rights.  \n We have come a long way in building our \npolitical system, which is based on the National \nCollaboration Government. Iraq has started to restore \nthe elements of strength that were lost due to more than \nthree decades of internal and external wars conducted \nby the former dictatorship, due also to the international \nisolation and the sanctions that Iraq experienced and to \nthe collapse of security institutions and outbreak of \nsectarian strife that threatened its national existence \nafter the collapse of the former regime. We began to \novercome these negative elements and they became \nhistory, thanks to our determination and steadfastness \nand with the help and support of the international \ncommunity. \n With regard to development, having witnessed \nthe big improvement in security in Iraq, we are still \nrelying on the five-year plan for the years 2010-2014 \nannounced by the Iraqi Government on 4 April 2010 \nand on the licensing rounds held between Iraq and \nmajor companies on oil and natural gas investments to \nimprove our oil industry. That was done to turn the \nwheels of development and push the economy to \nadvanced levels.  \n It is expected that the five-year plan that has \nalready started will include about 2,700 strategic \nprojects in different sectors, with a cost of $186 billion. \nThe plan would provide about four million job \nopportunities, which will positively deal with the \nunemployment problem in Iraq. It is hoped that by the \nend of this plan, the per capita income of Iraqi citizens \nwill have increased to $8,000 annually and poverty \nlevels will have decreased by 16 per cent. \n In addition, we were able to get rid of the \nsanctions and restrictions imposed on Iraq as a result of \nthe invasion of Kuwait. On the basis of Security \nCouncil resolutions 1956 (2010), 1957 (2010) and \n1958 (2010), adopted on 15 December 2010, Iraq has \nbeen freed completely from all the restrictions imposed \non it, which had prevented the country from taking \nadvantage of scientific and technological advances, and \nhas gained sovereignty over its financial resources.  \n After that important stage in building our State, \nwe feel that we are taking firm steps on the road to \ndemocracy and development and that we are opening \n \n \n5 11-51185 \n \nthe doors to investment in Iraq. Therefore, the \neconomic policy of Iraq is essentially based on \nencouraging investment and providing the appropriate \nlegislative environment to protect investors and their \ncapital so that Iraq can become a safe and fertile \ninvesting environment in many essential sectors, such \nas oil, natural gas, electricity, reconstruction, \ninfrastructure and other economic sectors. From this \nrostrum I call on all countries to open collaboration \nchannels with Iraq in the field of investment and to \ntake advantage of the available opportunities.  \n Iraqi Kurdistan has witnessed important \ndevelopments in the fields of construction, the \neconomy, the culture and others. Thousands of villages \nthat were destroyed by the former regime have been \nrebuilt. Cities, towns and roadways have been \nmodernized. The region now has more than 15 public \nand private universities with more than 100,000 \nstudents, compared to the past when there was only one \nuniversity with a few thousand students. \n At the end of this year the United States forces \nwill withdraw, according to the agreement signed \nbetween the two countries in 2008. During this year, \nour security forces have shown a great ability to \ncombat terrorism and provide security. These forces are \ncapable and will efficiently fill the vacuum that the \nwithdrawal of the United States forces will create. That \nwill promote Iraqi national abilities to maintain the \ngains achieved in the new Iraq.  \n However, the need will push the Government of \nIraq to keep numbers of American experts and others in \norder to benefit from their experience in the fields of \ntraining and capacity-building, according to Iraq\u2019s \nneeds. On this occasion, on behalf of the Government \nand people of Iraq, I should like to express our thanks \nand appreciation to the United States, other friendly \nStates and the United Nations that provided assistance \nand support to the Iraqi people and Government in \norder to enhance democracy and reconstruction.  \n I avail myself of the opportunity of being here in \nNew York to express to the people of New York and to \nall Americans feelings of sympathy and solidarity on \nthe tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on \n11 September. \n Regarding Iraq\u2019s international and regional \nrelations, the Constitution of Iraq and the national \nprogramme of the current Iraqi Government determine \nthe general foundations for our foreign policy. They \nprovide that Iraq is a founding and effective member of \nthe League of Arab States and is committed to its \nCharter. Iraq is also a member of the Islamic world. On \nthis basis Iraq is working to host the Arab summit at \nthe end of March 2012.  \n Moreover, Iraq respects the principles of good \nneighbourliness and is committed to non-interference \nin the internal affairs of other States. It seeks to solve \ndisputes by peaceful means, establishes its relations on \nthe basis of common interests and reciprocity, and \nrespects its international obligations. That is why we \ninvite our two neighbours, Turkey and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, to resort to diplomacy and positive \ndialogue in order to solve the issues and to stop \nbombing Iraqi territories in the Kurdistan region, \nwhich is causing many innocent civilian victims. I \navail myself of this opportunity to thank His Holiness \nKhamenei of the Islamic Republic of Iran for releasing \nthe two American prisoners in Iran. \n With regard to our obligations to disarmament \nand nuclear non-proliferation, the Constitution of Iraq \nwas clear in determining the position of Iraq \nconcerning this issue. Article 9 E of the Iraqi \nConstitution provides that \n \u201cThe Iraqi Government shall respect and \nimplement Iraq\u2019s international obligations \nregarding the non-proliferation, non-development, \nnon-production, and non-use of nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons, and shall \nprohibit associated equipment, materiel, \ntechnologies, and delivery systems for use in the \ndevelopment, manufacture, production, and use \nof such weapons.\u201d \nOn this clear position and commitment of Iraq to \ninternational instruments concerning disarmament, the \nSecurity Council on 15 December 2010 adopted \nresolution 1957 (2010), which lifted all restrictions that \nwere imposed on Iraq.  \n In this context we wish to confirm the legitimate \nright of States to the peaceful use of nuclear power and \nits technologies according to the rules and provisions \nof the relevant international conventions. This right \nconstitutes one of the foundations of the disarmament \nsystem and non-proliferation. Within this approach and \nwith regard to the nuclear issue concerning the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, we believe in the legitimate right of \nStates to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \nThat right is guaranteed by international instruments, at \n  \n \n11-51185 6 \n \nthe forefront of which is the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  \n We affirm the importance of reaching a peaceful \nsolution in dealing with this issue. Dialogue and calm \ndiplomacy are the best means to achieve that goal. On \nthe other hand, any escalation will prejudice the \ninterests of all parties and will put the security of the \nregion at great risk. \n Iraq is concerned about the tragic situation of the \nbrotherly Palestinian people as a result of Israeli \npractices, which are incompatible with international \nlaws, customs and international humanitarian law. Iraq \nis doing everything in its power to support the struggle \nof the Palestinian people to obtain all their inalienable \nrights, in particular the right to establish an \nindependent State in its homeland, with its capital in \nJerusalem.  \n In this regard, Iraq endorses and supports the path \nembarked on by the Palestinian Authority to come to \nthe United Nations to achieve full international \nrecognition of a Palestinian State during the current \nsession of the General Assembly. Iraq calls on the \ninternational community and all peace-loving forces to \nstand by the Palestinian people in their legitimate \nstruggle to achieve their goals and demands that the \nIsraeli Government fully withdraw from all Arab \nterritories occupied in 1967. That would essentially \ncontribute to the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict \nand bring a comprehensive and just peace to this vital \nregion of the world.  \n Making the Middle East an area free of weapons \nof mass destruction is crucial to achieve peace, security \nand stability. That requires Israel to join the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to put \nits nuclear facilities under the comprehensive \nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. \n The countries of the Arab world are witnessing \nsignificant developments and unprecedented reforms \nand political changes, the effects of which will be \nreflected in the future of the whole region and will \nextend to areas beyond. Iraq, as an early actor in \ninitiating this change, supports the struggle of the Arab \npeople of the region to gain their freedom, choose their \npolitical systems and exercise their right to peaceful \ndemonstrations and protests in the so-called Arab \nSpring. We hope that these changes will contribute to \nregional stability and security and avoid anything that \nmight threaten the unity and sovereignty of the \ncountries of the region or stir up strife or sectarian and \nethnic conflicts. \n In the area of international cooperation, Iraq will \nwork to promote cooperation with all countries that \nstood with it and supported it in the stability of the \nongoing political process, in strengthening it and in \nreconstruction. We refer here to the United States of \nAmerica and to the European Union. When we mention \nthese two parties we mention them not because they \nare the only ones that stood with Iraq, but because we \nare linked by mechanisms of action that should be \nimplemented. There are many other friends who stood \nwith us in the difficult times that we have experienced, \nand we will remember that favour and develop \nrelations of cooperation with them.  \n After the withdrawal of the United States forces \nfrom Iraq by the end of this year, we will work to \nenhance and expand the scope of cooperation on the \nbasis of the strategic framework agreement signed \nbetween the two countries in 2008. According to that \nagreement, relations will be for the long term and will \ncover all aspects of life.  \n The same is true for the European Union. After \nfinishing the drafting of the Partnership and \nCooperation Agreement between Iraq and the European \nUnion and its possible signing in the near future, and \nsigning a memorandum of understanding on the \nstrategic partnership in the field of energy between Iraq \nand the European Union, the cooperation between the \ntwo parties will take a broader scope in various fields \ncovered by those agreements.  \n Our economic, commercial and political relations \nwith the People\u2019s Republic of China are expanding and \nimproving. Our relations with neighbouring Arab \ncountries, India and Pakistan, are also constantly \nimproving. \n Regarding our relationship with the United \nNations, we will continue an approach of constructive \ncooperation with all United Nations bodies, in the \nforefront of which are the Security Council and the \nSecretariat, and we will keep the commitments we have \nmade.  \n I should like to take this opportunity to express \nmy appreciation for the efforts by Special Representative of \nthe Secretary-General Mr. Ad Melkert throughout his time \nin Iraq. I wish him and his family success and good \n \n \n7 11-51185 \n \nhealth. I welcome the new representative of the \nSecretary-General. We will continue to cooperate with \nhim in a way that will enable him to carry out his task \nin accordance with Security Council resolution 1770 \n(2007) and subsequent resolutions.  \n The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq \nwill receive all forms of support and assistance from \nus, in particular during the next phase, and we will do \nour utmost to provide the necessary protection for its \nstaff and premises. \n We look forward with confidence and optimism \nto the future. Iraq is an emerging democracy and a \ncountry brimming with a wealth of natural and human \nresources. We are working to make it an important \nfactor in regional stability, security and prosperity and \na living example of democracy, federalism and the \nvoluntary coexistence of different ethnic and sectarian \ngroups and communities."

        "file_text": "I heartily congratulate the \nPresident on his unanimous election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I wish him \nevery success and assure him that Malta, which enjoys \nexcellent relations and increasing cooperation with his \ncountry, Qatar, will extend its full support and \ncollaboration in the tasks ahead of him. I would also \nlike to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, \nfor his leadership and effective role over the last 12 \nmonths. \n I would also like to convey my warm and sincere \ncongratulations to His Excellency Ban Ki-moon on his \nre-election to serve our Organization as its Secretary-\nGeneral for another term. My Government would like \nto put on record its appreciation for his firm and \ncapable leadership. \n Just two months ago this Assembly admitted by \nacclamation the Republic of South Sudan as the \n193rd Member of the United Nations. Malta is proud to \nhave been one of the Member States co-sponsoring the \nresolution that ushered the new nation-State of the \nRepublic of South Sudan into the world community of \nnations (resolution 65/308). \n Throughout the 12 months that have passed since \nwe last gathered here in this Assembly, we have all \nbeen witness to the continuing upheavals and crises \nresulting from the strife, poverty and social inequalities \nthat unfortunately persist in many parts of the world. \nThis situation has been compounded by food \ninsecurity, which in turn is exacerbated by the drought \nand famine that threaten the survival of millions of \npeople, particularly in Somalia and the rest of the Horn \nof Africa. \n Malta has long recognized the difficulties facing \ncountries in the Horn of Africa and has directed most \nof its development and humanitarian aid to them \nthrough development projects. The participation of \nMaltese non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in \nimplementing those projects has been pivotal in \nenabling Malta to help relieve some of the most \npressing needs. My Government has also answered the \ncall of the United Nations for financial contributions to \nassist in alleviating the sufferings of people in the Horn \nof Africa. This we did through the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund. \n It is a matter of concern, however, that only four \nyears remain to meet the goals that we unanimously \nagreed, in the Millennium Declaration of 2000 \n(resolution 55/2), to achieve by 2015. We \nacknowledge, of course, that progress has been made in \nsome critical areas, notwithstanding continuing \nadversities. But we are still not there.  \n Within its limited means, Malta has been able to \nfinancially assist and support NGOs and interested \nindividuals to carry out projects in developing and least \ndeveloped countries. Over the past 19 months, these \nprojects have included building schools, clinics, \ncentres for persons with disabilities, social housing, \nand extensions at hospitals in various countries in \nAfrica, as well as in Central and South America. \n My Government continues to ask the membership \nof this Organization to consider the case for assistance \nin dealing with the influx of illegal immigrants who are \ncontinuing to reach Malta as a result of the situation in \nLibya and North Africa. We continue to call for \ninternational solidarity and burden-sharing in dealing \nwith this phenomenon. It is also our hope that the \nEuropean Union\u2019s Asylum Support Office, which \nopened in Malta in June, will contribute to the task of \nstreamlining asylum policies in the European Union \nand its member States and improve cooperation among \nthe authorities. In that context, may I express the \nappreciation of the Government of Malta for the \nassistance we have received so far from a number of \nEuropean States and the United States of America in \nthe resettlement process. \n The Mediterranean, which links Europe, Africa \nand the Middle East, has not been spared the many \nchallenges and difficulties facing other parts of the \nworld. It is, however, also seeing the birth of hope in \nthe form of a new political and social reality as a result \nof the sacrifices being made by the peoples of Tunisia, \nEgypt, Libya and Syria as they strive to take back the \npolitical leadership of their countries. Malta salutes \nthese brave people. \n As we heard a few minutes ago from His \nExcellency Mr. Jibreel, who spoke on behalf of Libya, \nthese are turbulent times for Libya, a crucial and \nmomentous point in the history of the Libyan people. \nDuring this time, Malta, which over the course of its \nhistory has earned the title \u201cnurse of the \n \n \n51 11-51360 \n \nMediterranean\u201d, has also been serving as a safe \nharbour, where thousands have found refuge and \nassistance.  \n As a Member of this esteemed Organization, of \nthe European Union and of the international contact \ngroup on Libya, my Government has provided, over the \npast several months, a humanitarian hub for the \nevacuation of nearly 20,000 people, medical assistance \nand relief efforts by intergovernmental and \nnon-governmental organizations, including such United \nNations agencies as the World Food Programme. Malta \nis proud of this role, which it continues to play in \nalleviating hardships, particularly those of the Libyan \npeople, to this very day. \n As a result of the courage, vision and tenacity of \nits people, Libya is today on the threshold of assuming \nits place in the community of free and democratic \nnations. The approach taken by the Libyan National \nTransitional Council (NTC) over these recent, highly \ncharged weeks has undoubtedly enhanced its standing \nand legitimacy. We welcome the NTC\u2019s determination \nto ensure that justice, and not vengeance, will be \npursued by these brave people. It is important that the \nprocess of national reconciliation take hold as soon as \npossible and that it be underpinned by the fullest \nrespect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms \nof all segments of the population. \n Allow me, at this juncture, to take this \nopportunity to join others in welcoming the delegation \nof Libya as the new and rightful representatives of \nLibya to the United Nations and in this Assembly. \n The next few months will be a major challenge \nfor the international community and the people of \nLibya alike. At this defining moment the Libyan people \ndeserve the fullest international solidarity on the \npolitical, economic and financial fronts. My \nGovernment supports United Nations leadership in the \ninternational community\u2019s programme of action and \nendorses the three fundamental principles under which \nthe United Nations intends to operate: Libyan national \nownership, rapid response and delivery and, lastly, \neffective coordination. Close coordination, in particular \nwith the European Union, which we believe to be a key \nplayer in post-conflict assistance and support, will be \nespecially crucial in this scenario. \n Egypt and Tunisia also deserve every \nencouragement as they embark on the reforms ahead. \nDemocratic transition processes need to be sustained, \nincluding from the economic perspective. A holistic \napproach is a crucial element in maximizing \ninternational endeavours, not least to stimulate \neconomic growth. Democracy stands a better chance of \nflourishing if there is economic development and \ntangible improvement in living standards enjoyed by \nthe entire population. \n At a time when people in the Middle East, North \nAfrica and beyond have embarked on a new path \ntowards freedom, dignity and prosperity, we must also \ninvest our efforts and determination to fulfil the long-\nsought aspirations of the Palestinian people. The \ndramatic developments unfolding in the Arab world \nmake progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track even \nmore urgent than before.  \n Malta was heartened by, and welcomed, the \nspeech of President Obama last May, in which he laid \nout the foundation for future negotiations and outlined \na comprehensive vision for peace between Israelis and \nPalestinians. The resumption of meaningful and \nsustainable negotiations seemed, at the time, to be \nwithin reach. \n Unfortunately, that was not to be. The time \nframes set by the international community for the \nestablishment of a Palestinian State are now with us. A \npolitical stalemate persists, despite the fact that from \nan institutional perspective, the preparations for \nstatehood have been successfully completed. The \nsituation on the ground further complicates matters and \nundermines the resumption of negotiations and the goal \nof two viable States living side by side in peace. \n No effort should be spared to break the deadlock \nin the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Getting Israelis and \nPalestinians back to the negotiating table with the \npolitical will necessary to embark on meaningful and \nsustainable negotiations must remain the overriding \ngoal. Agreement on parameters for negotiations would \nclearly be a step in the right direction. In this regard, \nMalta fully stands behind the efforts of the European \nUnion, particularly those of its High Representative for \nForeign Affairs and Security Policy, to make this \nhappen. \n My Government strongly believes that the \nelements set out in the conclusions adopted by the \nForeign Affairs Council of the European Union in \nDecember 2009, December 2010 and May 2011 \nprovide balanced parameters for the resumption of \nnegotiations. \n  \n \n11-51360 52 \n \n Two weeks ago, the New York community and \nthe American people were joined by the international \ncommunity in commemorating the victims of one of \nthe most heinous crimes committed in recent history. \nWe all remember with sadness and sorrow that fateful \nday of 11 September 2001, when the hand of evil \ncarried out a terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre \nin downtown New York. The 10 years that have passed \nsince that tragic event, when nearly 3,000 innocent \npeople met their deaths and thousands more were \nwounded, have not erased the scars or the pain. \n Terrorism continues to respect no frontiers. Many \nStates have been and continue to be the victims of \ndeadly attacks by terrorists. In Afghanistan, Iraq, India, \nPakistan, Russia, Spain, Indonesia, the United \nKingdom and China, terrorism has struck with intensity \nand brutality. Only one month ago, another \nreprehensible and deadly attack was carried out, on the \nUnited Nations complex in Nigeria. Malta strongly \ncondemns those cowardly and horrible acts and pledges \nto continue to work with other Member States to ensure \nthat such criminal acts are not only condemned in \nabsolute terms, but also suppressed. \n The events unfolding in North Africa highlight \nthat we must continue to promote and protect human \nrights across the world. That is a responsibility that our \npresent generation bears on behalf of future \ngenerations. It was in that spirit that, in my address to \nthe sixty-fourth session of the Assembly in 2009 (see \nA/64/PV.6), I proposed the drafting of a universal \ndeclaration of human responsibilities, as the second \npart of a diptych to be formed with the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. Such a declaration \nwould be open for signature to any Member State \nwishing to subscribe to it. \n We have been encouraged to move forward in \npresenting such a draft declaration by a number of \nMember States that share with us a belief in the \ngrowing need to embrace responsibilities and duties in \nthe international setting. In the light of that positive \nresponse, my Government intends to call an \ninternational gathering in 2012, at the official level but \nwith the presence of experts, to examine the draft \ndeclaration that will have been prepared and finalize it \nin such a way that it can be opened for signature in \n2012. Malta strongly believes that such a declaration \nwould strengthen the solidarity that our rapidly \nchanging world demands. \n In conclusion, allow me to state that the \nenvironmental sustainability of our planet is one of the \npriorities of my Government. Malta is working towards \na successful outcome at next year\u2019s United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development in the hope \nthat it will build further on the commitments agreed at \nthe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment \nand Development. In that context, since 1988, when \nMalta put the protection of climate for present and \nfuture generations on the political agenda of the \nOrganization, my Government has worked to support \nand endorse efforts that address climate change. Malta \nhas also made a contribution to the Special Climate \nChange Fund. \n The coming 12 months under the presidency of \nAmbassador Al-Nasser offer the membership of the \nOrganization challenging and exciting times. The \nagenda of the Assembly is long and demanding. We \nrecognize that the President\u2019s task will not be at all \neasy, and we assure him of our full support. \n Malta will also continue to shoulder its \ninternational responsibilities with vigour, commitment \nand determination. We stand ready to work with other \nMember States to make the Organization stronger and \nbetter able to tackle the global challenges facing \nmankind."

        "file_text": "It is a distinct pleasure for \nme to participate in the general debate of the General \nAssembly for the first time since my election as \nPresident of Croatia. \n At the outset, I would like to congratulate \nAmbassador Al-Nasser on his election as President of \nthe General Assembly in its sixty-sixth session. I also \nthank Joseph Deiss for his excellent work during his \npresidency of the General Assembly in the preceding \nsession. \n Let me also congratulate Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon on his re-election to that important and \nchallenging post and assure him of the full cooperation \nof my country. \n Current challenges \u2014 the fall of autocratic \nregimes, nuclear non-proliferation, terrorism, the \ncontinuing global financial and economic crisis, \nclimate change, underdevelopment \u2014 require all of us \nhere at the United Nations to firmly stand together and \noffer common solutions on the basis of solidarity, \nresponsibility and respect for the rights and dignity of \nevery person on the globe. Our responses to challenges \nmust not remain just words. We need to translate them \ninto concrete actions, aimed at advancing democracy, \nenhancing development and well-being, protecting \nhuman rights, respecting international law, ensuring \n  \n \n11-50871 32 \n \nsocial justice and promoting the rule of law, at the \ndomestic, regional and international levels. \n I welcome the President\u2019s decision to hold this \ndebate under the theme of \u201cThe role of mediation in \nthe settlement of disputes\u201d. Mediation has rightly been \nrecognized as an efficient and cost-effective tool, \nwhich the United Nations has at its disposal in \naddressing threats to the maintenance of international \npeace and security. Political issues often lie at the heart \nof crises. Therefore, the importance of early \nengagement and preventive diplomacy, including \nmediation, is even more significant in this period when \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations are \nexperiencing unprecedented demand and strain. \n My country has come a long way since the \nconflict in the 1990s, when Croatia hosted a total of \nfive United Nations peacekeeping operations on its \nterritory. We have developed a stable democracy and a \nfree-market economy, and we serve as an anchor of \npeace, security and stability in the region of South-East \nEurope. \n That experience and the lessons learned have \nbeen the backdrop for our engagement in the Security \nCouncil, where Croatia has proved to be a responsible \nand dedicated partner in the common effort to maintain \nand build peace. We intend to pursue efforts with the \nsame vigour in the Peacebuilding Commission, the \nEconomic and Social Council and other United Nations \nbodies for which Croatia is a candidate. \n When all efforts to avoid conflict fail, the \ninternational community turns as a rule to the United \nNations to stop the hostilities and maintain peace. \nCroatia will continue its engagement in peacekeeping \noperations under United Nations auspices. But keeping \nthe peace is not enough. In countries emerging from \nconflict, peace needs to be strengthened and \nconsolidated.  \n Croatia has, in a relatively short time, effectively \ntransitioned from a donor-recipient to a donor-provider. \nToday we share our knowledge and experiences with \ncountries in the region, as well as with other countries \nin crisis, where our post-conflict experience in nation-\nbuilding is particularly relevant. My country, working \ntogether with other Member States and the United \nNations as a whole \u2014 and acting with the same \nenthusiasm and spirit that clearly characterized the \ninternational community\u2019s ambitions almost six years \nago when the Peacebuilding Commission was \nestablished \u2014 stands ready to play its part in the \nrevival of the peacebuilding architecture and thorough \nimplementation of its core functions. \n Croatia has completed its accession negotiations \nwith the European Union (EU) and expects to become \na full member in 2013. Once it joins the EU, Croatia \nwill consistently advocate further EU enlargement and \nwill not use its outstanding bilateral issues to set \nconditions for the progress of individual countries in \nthe process of their integration with the EU. \n I have held numerous meetings with my \ncounterparts in the region, in particular the Presidents \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In our \nmeetings, we have discussed the continuation of the \nreconciliation process, the resolution of outstanding \nissues among the three States and our mutual political \nsupport. Croatia has pledged technical assistance in the \nprocess of integration into the European Union and has \nstressed the need to jointly define regional networks of \ninfrastructure systems and submit them as regional \nprojects for funding from EU funds. \n As a member of NATO and a future member of \nthe EU, we have a keen interest to see South-East \nEurope become a region of security, stability and \ndevelopment. That may not happen overnight, but I \nfirmly believe that with sustained effort and targeted \nactions by all politicians and peoples, the region will \nlose its negative reputation as an arena of political \nfragmentation often accompanied by bloodshed, and \nwill deservedly become known as an area where good-\nneighbourly relations, tolerance and mutual \ncooperation prevail, thus making it a European success \nstory of peacebuilding and reconciliation. \n However, without justice, efforts to ensure true \nreconciliation and sustainable peace may be unable to \ntake root firmly. Croatia strongly supports determined \nefforts to put an end to impunity for the most serious \ncrimes of concern to humanity and, in that context, \nreaffirms its commitment to international criminal \njustice in general and to the activities of the \nInternational Criminal Court in particular. \n Croatia supports the main purpose and primary \nfunctions of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), namely, the establishment \nof a lasting peace and reconciliation. Croatia \nappreciates the efforts to implement the ICTY \ncompletion strategy and its transformation towards \nresidual mechanisms. Full cooperation with the ICTY \n \n \n33 11-50871 \n \nand respect for international justice are a lasting \ncommitment for us, not only in the context of the \nEuro-Atlantic integration processes, but also as an \nexpression of Croatia\u2019s core values and its role in the \ninternational community. We greatly appreciate the \nlegacy of the ICTY, especially its contribution to \ninternational law, justice and reconciliation. That \nlegacy has already improved national judiciaries in the \nregion through its promotion of high standards of \ncriminal responsibility for breaches of humanitarian \nlaw. Further development of international law, both \ninternational and national judiciaries and a better \nunderstanding of justice will be based on this positive \nlegacy, but also on the lessons learned from some of \nthe ICTY\u2019s weaknesses. \n Future development of international criminal law \nshould consider improving the efficiency of \ninternational courts and of State cooperation, as well as \ninstituting a critical evaluation of some procedural and \nsubstantive laws. In that regard, we should consider \nmore efficient measures to be taken in cases of \nnon-cooperative States, the position of victims and \ntheir compensation, and the protection of witnesses, as \nwell as the concept of joint criminal enterprise, and \nothers. \n The protection of fundamental rights and \nfreedoms must be ensured when addressing very \nserious security challenges, such as international \nterrorism. Croatia strongly supports the values and \nobjectives of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, since it confirms that the United \nNations is at the centre of global counter-terrorism \nefforts. We had the privilege of chairing the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee during Croatia\u2019s membership in \nthe Security Council, and we are willing to share our \nknowledge and experience with others, in the region \nand beyond. \n The Arab Spring, which is rooted in the \nlegitimate aspirations of ordinary people for improved \neconomic opportunities and political participation, has \njust moved into summer, but its democratic gains must \nbe preserved if we do not want to see another relapse \ninto instability. I believe that the course of recent \nevents in Libya has clearly confirmed that the coalition \nforces and the Security Council took the right approach \nin protecting civilians from the brute force of the old \nregime. I hope that the democratic forces in Libya will \nbegin to build a new State that will provide the same \nlevel of protection and equal opportunities for all \nLibya\u2019s citizens. It is crucial to work towards \nestablishing the rule of law throughout the country. We \ntrust that the National Transitional Council will \nsucceed in achieving that goal. My country is ready to \nparticipate in Libya\u2019s reconstruction, especially given \nits experience in post-conflict nation- and institution-\nbuilding. Taking into account new political and \nhumanitarian priorities in the field, Croatia has sent \ntargeted humanitarian assistance to Libya, with an \nemphasis on medical and humanitarian needs. \n In the same vein, Croatia has recognized the \nlegitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, who need \nand deserve wide and undivided support. We share the \ninternational community\u2019s belief that it is essential to \nnormalize the situation and prevent further mass \nviolations of human rights, strengthen democratic \nstandards and the rule of law, and assist those who \nshare the vision of a democratic Syria. \n Croatia shares the sense of urgency concerning \nthe importance of securing an early resumption and \nconclusion of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, aimed at \nachieving a two-State solution. The current \nunprecedented and deep changes in the political \nlandscape of the Middle East call for urgent and highly \nresponsive action by all parties concerned. Mutual \nrecognition \u2014 Israel\u2019s recognition of a Palestinian \nState and Palestine\u2019s recognition of the Jewish State \u2014 \nconstitutes both the starting point and the desired \noutcome of peace negotiations. Failure to move \nforward on a two-State solution now may have \nunpredictable negative consequences, not only for \nIsrael and Palestine, but for the whole international \ncommunity. Given our recent experience of war and \nreconciliation, Croatia calls on the leaders of the \nparties concerned to shoulder their historic \nresponsibility for the future of their peoples and for \npeace and stability in the Middle East. \n Recently, we witnessed an example of a new \nState being created in a generally peaceful manner, and \nI welcome South Sudan as the newest Member of the \nUnited Nations. However, this and many other ongoing \ncrises, in the Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo and other places, confirm the \nirreplaceable role of the United Nations in ending \nconflicts; and in this context mediation, as the theme of \nour debate, becomes even more relevant. \n Croatia continues to promote universal human \nrights and supports the mainstreaming of human rights \n  \n \n11-50871 34 \n \nwithin the United Nations framework. In that context, \nwe give particular attention to issues such as the \nabolition of the death penalty, gender equality and \ncombating all forms of discrimination, as well as the \npromotion of the human rights of the most vulnerable \nsocial groups, including women, children and persons \nwith disabilities. Croatia strongly supports the concepts \nof the universality, interrelatedness and indivisibility of \nall human rights. \n Croatia welcomes the establishment of UN-Women, \nthe new United Nations body focused on supporting \ngender equality and the empowerment of women. \nCroatia also supports relevant initiatives on the rights \nof lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and \nwill continue to be actively engaged in the follow-up \nprocess to the 2008 joint statement on human rights, \nsexual orientation and gender identity (see \nA/63/PV.70). \n In response to dramatic changes in the world in \nthe last few decades, comprehensive reforms of the \nUnited Nations system as a whole have been put \nforward. Those proposals include structural reform and \nimprovements in the way United Nations bodies \nfunction, as well as revitalization of the General \nAssembly. Although there are many important elements \nin this process, reforming the Security Council remains \nessential. Croatia believes that the Security Council \nmust adequately represent the current structure of the \nmembership of the United Nations. We therefore \nsupport enlarging the Security Council in both \npermanent and non-permanent membership categories. \nTaking into consideration that the number of members \nof the Eastern European Group has almost doubled, \nCroatia proposes that one seat be added for the Group \nin the non-permanent category. Croatia is also aware of \nthe importance of resolving all the other elements of \nSecurity Council reform. \n As we witness the increasing challenges \nappearing around the world, it is clear that we must all \nmake every effort to strengthen the capability, \nefficiency and credibility of the United Nations in \ngeneral. We welcome the establishment of the Change \nManagement Team, and look forward to seeing \nproposals for streamlining processes, increasing \naccountability and improving the efficiency of the \nUnited Nations in delivering its mandates. \n The challenges and consequences of climate \nchange are undermining efforts to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. Climate change must be further \nmainstreamed into the work of the whole United \nNations system, with a view to supporting efforts to \nhelp the transition to low-carbon economies consistent \nwith sustainable development, to strengthen countries\u2019 \nadaptation and resilience in the face of climate change, \nand to minimize the possible security implications. \n In the light of diminishing natural resources, \nenvironmental degradation, extreme poverty, hunger \nand diseases, and social unrest, we agree with others \nthat sustainable development has become the defining \nissue of our time. Our highly globalized and \ninterdependent world means that we share not only the \nsame challenges but a common fate. As a member of \nthe Bureau of the Preparatory Committee, Croatia will \nbe an active contributor to the preparations for next \nyear\u2019s United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, the Rio+20 Conference. This summit \nmeeting will provide a unique opportunity to \nreinvigorate the spirit of Rio and to restate a blueprint \nfor political commitment, partnership and action on the \nground without revisiting the agreements reached at \nRio in 1992 or at Johannesburg in 2002. \n Finally, let me return to what this Organization \nstands for. In order to achieve our common objectives, \nwe must demonstrate unity of purpose, firm resolve, \nsolidarity and responsibility. Or, as a famous composer \nonce said, \u201cOnly the pure in heart can make a good \nsoup.\u201d \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, allow me \nto extend to you, Sir, our warmest congratulations on \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-sixth session. It is a personal honour for me to \nspeak for the first time before this gathering of the \nworld\u2019s nations. Please be assured of my delegation\u2019s \nfull support and cooperation in the conduct of the work \nof this body. \n The year 2011 has already become a monumental \nyear in modern history. The call for reforms in the \nMiddle East and North Africa has led to unprecedented \ntransitions and popular uprisings. The so-called Arab \nSpring underscores the significance of people\u2019s \nlegitimate aspirations and the need to respond \nadequately to them. In this age of globalization, \ninformation, ideas and values flow beyond borders.  \n For Thailand, after experiencing some political \nunrest, the country has taken another step forward in its \ndemocratic process. The general elections held on \n3 July this year went smoothly, which is a testament to \nthe resilience of Thai democracy. The new Government \nhas been successfully formed, with a solid mandate \nfrom the people. Indeed, the voter turnout was the \nhighest in Thailand\u2019s electoral history. The \nAdministration of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra \nis now working resolutely to deliver on the promises it \nmade during the election campaign. In implementing \npeople-centred policies, it seeks to establish a strong, \n \n \n35 11-51670 \n \nequitable and sustainable economic infrastructure in \nthe country. More importantly, the Government is \ndetermined to promote reconciliation and uphold the \nrule of law to serve as a basis for harmony and unity \nwithin the country. \n As far as our foreign relations are concerned, the \nGovernment will further enhance relations with \nneighbouring countries and our friends outside the \nregion. Special emphasis is placed on promoting trust, \nconfidence and mutual respect, which is particularly \nimportant as we prepare for the realization of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Community in \n2015. We will also strengthen international cooperation \nat all forums and levels, particularly with the United \nNations. \n Thailand seeks to play a responsible and \nconstructive role in the current international order. \nThailand is convinced that the three pillars of the \nUnited Nations - peace and security, development and \nhuman rights - are all interconnected and mutually \nreinforcing. They are issues that need to be addressed \ncomprehensively in order to achieve the ultimate goal \nof human security for our peoples. They are also issues \nthat Thailand will emphasize in its cooperation with \nthe United Nations. \n In terms of peace and security, Thailand believes \nthat this year\u2019s theme for the General Assembly\u2019s \ngeneral debate, as proposed by you, Mr. President, is \nvery timely. Mediation is a crucial tool for helping to \nresolve disputes peacefully. The recent birth of the \nRepublic of South Sudan and its swift admission to the \nUnited Nations are clear testaments to the constructive \nrole of Mediterranean and the continued engagement of \nthe United Nations in conflict resolution. Thailand \nwelcomes the Republic of South Sudan into the global \ncommunity, and wishes to forge bilateral relations and \na partnership for development with this new State. \n Thailand is convinced that the peaceful resolution \nof conflicts is the most desirable and cost-effective \napproach in terms of both human lives and financial \nexpense. For that reason, political will remains a key \ningredient without which such an approach cannot be \nsuccessful.  \n Wishing to do our part, Thailand has actively \nsupported the comprehensive peace operations and \npeacekeeping missions of the United Nations in more \nthan 20 locations around the world. We are currently \ndeploying an infantry battalion with the African Union-\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. We have \nalso sent police and military officers to the United \nNations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste and \nHaiti, and we are about to deploy military officers to a \nUnited Nations operation in Kashmir. In addition, since \nautumn 2010 Thailand has sent two counter-piracy task \ngroups to join international efforts to patrol and protect \nships from pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden area. \nThese are just a few examples of our effort to play a \nmeaningful role in maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. \n If international stability is one of our primary \ngoals, Thailand firmly believes that a key foundation \nfor lasting peace is sustainable development. \nSustainable development is an essential tool for \neradicating poverty and inequality, which are root \ncauses of insecurity. As the guiding principle of our \nsocial and economic policy, Thailand has long taken a \npeople-centred approach and adheres to the \nsufficiency-economy philosophy of His Majesty King \nBhumibol Adulyadej, which focuses on living in \nmoderation and striking a balance between economic \ngrowth and the sustainable management of natural \nresources. \n Our Government is also working resolutely to \nensure, among other things, equal opportunity for all, \nfree primary and secondary education, and universal \nhealth care coverage. Although we have achieved most \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead \nof schedule, we are resolutely pursuing the MDG Plus \ntargets. In the greater scheme of things, we are \ndetermined that no one in Thai society should be left \nbehind. \n In order for sustainable development to be \nrealized, cooperation among all sectors of society and \npartnerships with the international community are \nessential. Thailand has been active in promoting \npartnerships between developed and developing \ncountries, and stands ready to serve as a bridge \nbetween both groups through triangular cooperation. At \nthe same time, we will continue to strengthen South-\nSouth cooperation with our fellow developing \ncountries, including those in the Non-Aligned \nMovement and the Group of 77 and China. \n Thailand has also assumed a more creative and \nproactive role in cooperation with the international \ncommunity in various development areas. Over the \nyears, relations between the United Nations and \n  \n \n11-51670 36 \n \nThailand have evolved from a traditional donor-\nrecipient relationship to one of partners in \ndevelopment. \n Neither development nor peace and security can \nbe sustainable if respect for human rights lags behind. \nThailand firmly believes that human rights represent \ntruly universal values. Respect for them must be a \nfundamental principle in every society. For Thailand, \nhuman rights issues are at the core of our domestic and \nforeign policy agendas. In terms of foreign policy, \nThailand has striven to play a constructive role at the \nregional and international levels, especially through \nour membership of the Human Rights Council. During \nour presidency of the Council, Thailand was proud to \ndirect the crucial task of reviewing its methods of work \nand operations in order to make it more relevant and \ncredible. This was particularly important when it came \nto responding to urgent human rights situations in a \nmore timely and effective manner. \n Every Government must find its own solutions \nand move at its own pace in a manner appropriate to its \nspecific context and conditions. Meanwhile, it is \nincumbent on the international community to support \nand promote constructive dialogue and engagement \nwith countries of concern, while respecting their \nsovereignty, territorial integrity and the will of the \npeople. Such support and dialogue should aim at \nstrengthening States\u2019 capacity to meet their human \nrights obligations. Here it is important, in Thailand\u2019s \nview, to find common ground on the value of technical \ncooperation in enhancing human rights. We have been \nholding consultations on an initiative to enhance the \nefficiency of the Human Rights Council in providing \ntechnical cooperation to countries in need. Thailand \nhopes that this initiative will receive the broad-based \nsupport of countries from all regions in the Council. \n With our genuine commitment to the promotion \nand protection of human rights, Thailand is determined \nto continue playing a constructive role in the Council. \nIn that regard, we will proudly stand for election once \nagain for the 2015-2017 term. As Thailand continues to \nenhance its participation as a member of the Human \nRights Council, we are determined to further contribute \nto human rights work and to strengthen the rights of \nvulnerable groups, both at home and abroad. We attach \nspecial importance to such groups, be they children, \nwomen, people with disabilities or the elderly.  \n One notable example is in the area of women\u2019s \nrights. In December 2010, the General Assembly \nadopted the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of \nWomen Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for \nWomen Offenders, or the Bangkok Rules (resolution \n65/229), based on an initiative of Her Royal Highness \nPrincess Bajrakitiyabha. The Rules aim to enhance the \nhuman rights of female prisoners in criminal justice \nsystems by fully recognizing gender sensitivity and the \nspecific needs of women. Thailand is committed to \npromoting the implementation of the Bangkok Rules \nworldwide and looks forward to continuing to work \nclosely with all relevant stakeholders. Moreover, the \nrecent election of the country\u2019s first female Prime \nMinister confirms that Thai society is open to women \nand that we continue to promote gender equality and \nthe empowerment of women. \n It should be evident from all I have said that the \nUnited Nations is a cornerstone of Thailand\u2019s foreign \npolicy, and that Thailand has been an active player in \nall three pillars of the United Nations. Peace and \nsecurity, development and human rights are truly \ninseparable and should be strengthened simultaneously. \nGiven our past experience and continued contributions \nto all three, especially the maintenance of international \npeace and security, Thailand has presented its \ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \nCouncil for the 2017-2018 term. We seek the support \nof our friends in the United Nations in this regard. We \nare convinced that such a position would enable us to \nfulfil our commitment to work closely and \nconstructively with all Members of the United Nations. \nLet us rise to the challenge together."

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of the people of Paraguay, Mr. President, I offer \nyou sincere congratulations on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I also thank Mr. Joseph Deiss for his laudable \nwork as President of the previous session, and \ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his re-appointment \nas Secretary-General. Throughout his tenure at the \nhead of the Organization for the past five years, he has \ndemonstrated his gift for leadership and his \n \n \n7 11-50702 \n \nunwavering commitment to world peace and \ninternational security. \n The people of Paraguay and their President, in \nconsonance with our extraordinary national history, \nbelieve deeply in the human being as the subject and \nend of and reason for every effort designed to benefit \nhumankind. The centrality of humans in the history of \nthe universe in all their endeavours, interests and \nconquests will be constantly proclaimed in this forum.  \n In order to begin to discuss the future of \nhumankind, we must correct mistakes and rethink \nparadigms that for decades, sometimes even for \ncenturies, have demonstrated their utter uselessness in \nbringing about change for good. Restoring men and \nwomen to centre stage in the concerns of the universe \nis a fundamental step in order merely to begin to trace \na basic outline for a future of certainty that seeks to \nreplace the frustrations of managing the development \nparadigm with the realities of a world in which well-\nbeing is much more tangible. \n What good does it do to discuss development \nplans if the goal of dignifying the human being is not \nthe beginning and the end of the process? At this stage \nin history, when we are thrilled by the most incredible \ntechnological achievements capable of keeping pace \nwith our flights of imagination and our dreams, where \ndoes that leave the nightmare of starving children who \nfight for a crust of bread, smile if they get it \u2014 and \nstill want to play? What benefit do we derive from the \nmedia hype about these great global and commercial \nachievements while in complicit silence the other half \nof humanity is holding out its hand, begging for a little \nhelp, for the love of God? What good does it do us to \ncontinue supporting a way of creating happiness in the \nworld that has been loudly shown to be a failure over \nand over again? \n Regions that enrich the economy of part of the \nworld with the natural abundance of their waters, their \noil, the precious stones hidden in the belly of their soil, \ncontinue inexorably to accumulate debt while their \ndaily offerings increase the wealth of rich societies \nevery day. The poor neighbour in today\u2019s world \npossesses riches \u2014 those closer to the simplicity of \nwell-being and happiness, such as water, food, forests \nand renewable energy \u2014 that are vital to its rich \nneighbours. But unbridled wealth cannot be the basis \nfor political dominion and certainly not for wars and \nmilitary might. We live in societies because our \npeoples and other human beings have mutual needs. \n Population growth is a serious global issue. \nSometimes it seems as though we live in a world that, \nworse than resigning itself to poverty, resigns itself to \ninequality, to the pornographic spectacle of scandalous \nimbalances which reveal the inner workings of an \nostentatious world celebrating its shame, as described \nby Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in his tale of Innocent \nEr\u00e9ndira and Her Heartless Grandmother. As long as \nthat continues, the dialogue between the rich bank that \nsustains and coordinates the world economy and the \npoor world that provides the natural resources will \ngradually become senseless. \n My country\u2019s growth rate in 2010 exceeded \n15 per cent; but tensions made efforts to redistribute \nthat wealth and reduce inequality more difficult than \nachieving the growth itself. \n I think that this is true all over the world. The \nUnited Nations needs to discuss measures to enable or \nassist Member States to work their way through fiscal \npolicies and international market regulations that \ncontribute to the stark reality of the huge fortunes that \nexist in the hands of just a few in some countries as \ncompared with the inequalities, droughts, humanitarian \ncrises in others. \n Solidarity is a ten-letter word that is fine-\nsounding but sometimes empty: empty of free will, \nactions and especially results. Solidarity is no longer \nsimply a moral imperative; it is a prerequisite for \nachieving progress and combating the dark side of \nignoring it: violence and crime. \n We live in a world which urgently requires a \nparadigm shift. And we must admit that the world is at \na crossroads; because one discourse that has been \ngoing on for five centuries in the name of progress and \nanother for six decades in the name of development \nhave only added uncertainty about any improvement in \nthe future lot of broad regions and thousands of \nmillions of people. \n The unrepentant incapability of the developed \ncountries to understand a very simple equation in order \nto set up local development plans as local plans for \ndevelopment means that known errors will be repeated \ndespite the urgent need for profound, convincing and \nradical rethinking capable of harnessing the mutual \ntrust that can promote progress towards the only \n  \n \n11-50702 8 \n \ntangible parameter, the only valid outcome, the only \ngenuine reality, which is a good life for all men and \nwomen. \n Achieving the good life for all should be the \nparadigm of our time. It clearly entails envisioning a \npost-development future in which thoughtfulness, \nobjectivity and goodwill coexist in harmony and \ngenuine solidarity reigns without delay between those \nin the powerful and wealthy world and those who live \nin poverty elsewhere.  \n This is not just a moral vision. Of fundamental \nimportance to progress is the sharing of wealth. And \nthat brings me to the main theme of this forum, \navoiding future conflict and future violence. But the \nparadigm of the good life requires plans that focus on \nthe dignity of human beings and the future rather than \non resource exploitation systems which almost never \nbenefit the people. \n In Latin America \u2014 the region to which my \nGovernment is committed \u2014 we live the daily paradox \nof poverty in the midst of the best basic conditions for \ngenerating wealth. Historically, since colonial times, \nour wealth has followed a one-way path to other \nregions of the world, without generating any structural \nimprovements in our economies. \n We attend the prestigious world summits of the \ndeveloped countries where the lot of poor countries has \nbeen debated for decades, yet we have had no luck. \nWhen will the countries of Latin America realize that \nwe export nature, we export oxygen, we export fresh \nwater, we export food, we export renewable energy? It \nmakes no sense that our countries remain poor, when \nwe have so many assets and products that enrich the \nrest of the world. \n Finally, on this subject, a paradigm shift to ensure \nthat human beings are at the centre of world concerns \nrequires commitment on the part of those who govern \nthe most powerful countries. We in turn must commit \nto supporting them and not abandoning them if that \nparadigm shift takes place. And the most intelligent \nform of support is, as we have just mentioned, to \ndevelop an awareness of what we are and the enormous \npotential with which our countries are endowed. \n Paraguay reaffirms its steadfast commitment to \nmultilateralism based on a democratic and egalitarian \nnew world order, an order that will ensure the \ncomprehensive and effective development of our \ncountries. Paraguay therefore believes both in a \nstronger and more democratic United Nations, as a \ntruly global organization, and in strengthening progress \nin the regional integration of peoples. For example, we \nhave the Union of South American Nations \u2014 \nUNASUR \u2014 and the future Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States, which provide \ncommon space for nations that share a common history, \ncommon values and common plans for sovereignty and \nindependence.  \n Global change is picking up speed. The still \nsignificant primacy of the central Powers in economic \nand military terms, and therefore in political and \ncultural terms, is facing demands for democratization \nof the world order and progress in multilateralism. The \nfinancial, energy, social and environmental crises are \nproof of the contradictions and conflicts in the strategic \ninterests of the great Powers as well as the weaknesses \nof the aid-dependent countries and those in the midst of \ndevelopment. We believe in mediation as a remedy to \novercome social injustice and as a path towards peace.  \n Among our peoples\u2019 demands for strengthened \ndemocracy, we see the spirit of the words of Nelson \nMandela when, in the past century, he said that there \ncan be no democracy with poverty and no democracy \nwith social inequality. That is why the theme of the \nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, on \nstrengthening the role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means, conflict prevention and \nresolution, has taken on greater relevance. \n Article 1 of the United Nations Charter states that \nthe purpose of our Organization is  \n \u201cto take effective collective measures for the \nprevention and removal of threats to the peace, \nand for the suppression of acts of aggression or \nother breaches of the peace\u201d. \nThus, in the face of violence and today\u2019s wars, whether \ntraditional or silent, short or long-term, there is a \ndemand for mediation as a mechanism for peace, as a \ntool to overcome global social injustice and thus a \nnecessary foundation for achieving international peace \nand security.  \n In that context, we advocate mediation in order to \novercome global social injustice and both traditional \nand silent wars. It must be based on the shared but \ndifferentiated responsibilities of all countries, \ndeveloping and developed, in order to guarantee the \n \n \n9 11-50702 \n \nconditions necessary for a peaceful world that relies on \nthe comprehensive and effective development of our \npeoples. Lastly, it must avoid ruinous hypotheses at all \ncosts, such as those that led to \u201cpreventive attacks\u201d, \nwhich culminated in the loss of many lives, the \ndestruction of entire cities and vital elements of \nuniversal culture, and sowed the seeds for the dreadful \nmistrust of any subsequent such initiatives. \n The self-determination of peoples should not be \nshaped by the political or economic interests of those \nwho oversee global equilibrium with weapons. It is, \nand must be, written in stone. \n Paraguay plays an active role in United Nations \npeacekeeping missions. Beginning this year, after more \nthan a decade of uninterrupted contributions of military \nobservers, Paraguay will be contributing a multirole \nengineering unit to the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti, the first to be deployed under our \nnational flag. \n The General Assembly should adopt the \nnecessary reforms so as to reaffirm its inherent nature \nas a universal, democratic and equitable representative \nbody. In this way, its powers will be recognized and \nwill take precedence over those of other bodies in the \nOrganization, such as the Security Council, in order to \nunderscore the processes that help to overcome \nviolence and globalized social injustice and build the \nmultipolar, democratic and egalitarian world that we so \ngreatly desire. \n In the same vein, democratizing the Security \nCouncil is becoming an increasingly urgent task. We \nurge the Council to fulfil its primary role of promoting \nworld peace and avoiding war, which is why it must be \nreformed and become more democratic. We must \naccord greater legitimacy to the Council by making it \nmore representative of the new multilateral and \nmultipolar world order, and by gradually doing away \nwith veto rights. \n We must express our concern, here before the \nGeneral Assembly, regarding the actions taken in Libya \nunder resolution 1973 (2011) of the Security Council \nand in the context of the responsibility to protect. We \nbelieve that the use of force must always be a last \nresort. \n That is why we are concerned about the crisis \naffecting the United Nations Security Council, which \ncan be overcome only through its reform and \ndemocratization. Thus, we insist and urge that efforts \ncontinue to be made to that end so that the Council can \nonce again fulfil its mission of guaranteeing \ninternational peace and security. \n In terms of foreign policy, Paraguay, as one of the \nfounding Members of the Organization, upholds and \nreiterates the constitutional principles governing its \ninternational relations: national independence, self-\ndetermination of peoples, legal equality of States, \nsolidarity and international cooperation, international \nprotection of human rights, freedom of navigation in \ninternational rivers, non-intervention, and condemnation of \nall forms of dictatorship, colonialism and imperialism.  \n In the 50 years since the embargo was imposed \non the people of Cuba, Paraguay has repeatedly \nexpressed its opposition to that economic, commercial \nand financial blockade, as have the countries of Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean. Paraguay has stood \ntogether with those countries and called for the \nimmediate lifting of the embargo. In particular, we \ndeplore the impact of this unjust blockade on the \nCuban people, which is a consequence of positive laws \nthat affect free trade and the transparent practice of \ninternational trade. \n In that respect, Paraguayan legislation does not \nrecognize the extraterritorial application of foreign \nlaws that violate the sovereignty of other States. This \npractice also violates the principles of international law \nthat we, the Members of the United Nations, defend \nand strive to uphold. \n Paraguay has consistently supported the \nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly at \nprevious sessions which call for the lifting of the \neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \nCuba. In full observance of resolution 65/6, entitled \n\u201cNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \nAmerica against Cuba\u201d, and before this Assembly, \nParaguay once again reiterates its support for the \nresolutions adopted in that regard. \n Consistent with the stance it has taken in \ninternational forums, in particular the United Nations, \nand considering the resolutions that condemn the \nIsraeli occupation of Palestinian territories, such as \nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), \n446 (1979) and 478 (1980), Paraguay established \ndiplomatic relations with Palestine on 25 March 2005 \n  \n \n11-50702 10 \n \nand recognizes a free and independent Palestinian State \nbased on the borders of 4 June 1967. \n We are gratified that the agenda of the sixty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly includes the \nrecognition of the free, sovereign and independent \nState of Palestine. We are convinced that this is a \nconfirmation of the historic debt of the international \ncommunity to recognize the legitimate right of the \nPalestinian people to have its own State with well-\ndefined borders. This will be a significant contribution \nto the peace process in the Middle East. \n We believe that urgent efforts are needed to \ndesign and build a new international financial \narchitecture, one that responds to the new era in which \nwe live and provides measures for avoiding systematic \ncyclical crises and for developing regional mechanisms \nfor economic and financial cooperation. Under this \nnew framework, nations with common histories and \ndestinies can create their own spaces for cooperation \nand economic partnerships. \n The countries of South America have focused the \nactions of UNASUR on this goal. We are confident \nthat, by coordinating and linking our economic \ninitiatives, we will lay the foundation for integration, \nwhich will not only protect our countries from crises \nthat are not of our creation, but also guarantee the \ncomprehensive development of our peoples. \n Paraguay is among those nation States which, \nover the course of history, have fallen prey to various \nvulnerabilities, given their geographic situation and \nhistorical experience. Paraguay has been weakened by \na historic model of socio-economic development based \non the looting of its natural and strategic resources and \nadministered through relations of structural \ndependence. \n That is why, in January 2010, Paraguay became \nthe Chair of the Group of Landlocked Developing \nCountries. In that capacity, we urge transit countries \nand their main neighbours, as applicable, as well as \ninternational organizations and the most developed \ncountries, to increase their commitment to implement \nthe Almaty Programme of Action, addressing the \nspecial needs of landlocked developing countries \nwithin a new global framework for transit transport \ncooperation. This will help such countries to overcome \ntheir limitations and will facilitate their overall \ndevelopment. \n As a complement to beginning the preparations \nfor the Conference of Landlocked and Transit \nDeveloping Countries, which will help us to overcome \nthe adversities we face, we are promoting the \nMultilateral Agreement for the Establishment of an \nInternational Think Tank for Landlocked Developing \nCountries, in the conviction that scientific advances in \nthat area will be of great importance in overcoming the \nobstacles that such countries face. \n Regarding the Millennium Development Goals, \nParaguay reaffirms its full commitment to achieving \nthose goals and expresses its concern about the extent \nto which they will be met by 2015. This is why we \nencourage Governments, civil society organizations \nand the private sector to work together to achieve \nthem.  \n Given its commitment to the goal of fully \nrespecting the human rights of our peoples, Paraguay \nhas decided to present its candidacy for the Human \nRights Council for the term 2014-2017. We hope to \nhave the support of the international community. \n We must express our serious concern for the \nenvironmental crisis, which is worsening on a daily \nbasis and even generating uncertainty about the \nsurvival of the human race. We fully support \nstrengthening the only legally binding agreement in \nthis area, the Kyoto Protocol, and its further extension. \nThe agreements reached in Canc\u00fan are a great support \nin improving emissions levels but they are voluntary in \nnature, which contradicts the principle of climate \njustice that our peoples so favour.  \n Finally, I would like to thank all those who \nhelped the Paraguayan initiative for the International \nDay of Friendship to come to fruition. The friendship \nof individuals, peoples and nations is not exclusively a \nquestion of diplomacy, much less a commercial \nenterprise to make money from the inclination of \nhuman beings to join together. Friendship is that bond \nwhich must necessarily be based on solidarity, and, in \nParaguay, we believe that it is high time for the world \nto make it happen.  \n I am pleased that this initiative has become \nuniversal. On behalf of the Paraguayan people, we \ngreet all the peoples of the world in the hope that we \nwill find the way to overcome global social injustices \nand thus guarantee a world culture of peace and \nfriendship based on the well-being and genuine \ndevelopment of all our peoples, without distinction."

        "file_text": "Allow \nme at the outset to warmly congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser \non his election as President of the General Assembly \nand to assure him of the support of my delegation \nthroughout the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.  \n The Secretary-General, whom I heartily \ncongratulate on his unanimous reappointment, \nintroduced, at the opening of the general debate, the \npriorities that he intends to implement during his \nsecond term in office. His vision, which will guide our \nendeavours and our deliberations during this period of \ninstability and uncertainty, sets forth the parameters for \na new form of global governance that will need to, on \nthe one hand, respond to the challenges that we face \nand to the aspirations of our peoples and, on the other, \ntake into consideration the new realities of our time. \n Among these new imperatives of the twenty-first \ncentury, sustainable development and the building of a \nsafer world require a more responsible approach on the \npart of all our Governments and the renewal of our \nunwavering support for the Organization, whose \ncrucial role in the prevention of conflicts, human rights \nviolations and natural disasters needs to be \nstrengthened and supported. \n It was Mr. Al-Nasser\u2019s clear-sighted initiative to \nmake the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes \nby peaceful means the theme of the general debate. Our \ncommunity now has a new Member \u2014 the Republic of \nSouth Sudan \u2014 following a peace process that was \nwelcomed by all. Since the beginning of the year, we \nhave seen a great impetus towards freedom and \ndemocracy among thousands of women and men across \nthe Arab world. The Arab Spring has highlighted once \nagain the universal nature of the norms and values of \nthe Organization. Justice, democracy, human dignity, \nequality and freedom have led to renewed hope among \npeoples for too long repressed. Today we face a great \nchallenge: not to disappoint them. \n The Government of the Principality reiterates its \nsupport for and its solidarity with all who fight for \nrespect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, \nand in that regard is hopeful that a just, lasting and \ncomprehensive settlement will enable the State of \nIsrael and a viable, sovereign and democratic \nPalestinian State to live side by side in peace and \nsecurity. \n The past year has been rich in challenges for our \nOrganization. We have had to face great natural and \nhumanitarian disasters, emergency situations caused by \npeople and the fallout of the economic crisis. Each \ntime we turn to this Organization to safeguard \nhumanity\u2019s shared assets, such as the environment, \nhealth and peace.  \n  \n \n11-51390 12 \n \n We also turn to the United Nations to protect our \ncollective security. The deadly attack a few weeks ago \non the United Nations offices in Abuja, the capital of \nNigeria, cruelly reminded us of the innumerable risks \nfaced by United Nations personnel across the world \u2014 \nin C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur, the Sudan, \neverywhere where the United Nations has saved lives \nor upheld rights. They sometimes pay the ultimate \nprice.  \n But our Organization has limited resources and \ncannot always deal with the multiplication of conflicts. \nWe must therefore focus above all on the prevention of \nconflicts. What is a better prevention measure than \ndevelopment? Last year from this same rostrum His \nSerene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco reiterated \nthe Principality\u2019s commitment to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) (see \nA/65/PV.4). Monaco seeks to be a responsible, reliable \nand supportive partner, and its priorities continue to be \nimproving the quality of life of the most vulnerable \npeople. \n I wish to underscore the essential role of women \nin the prevention and settlement of conflicts and in \npeacebuilding. Women and girls must be at the centre \nof our development strategies. It is now an established \nfact that a society that guarantees equality between \nwomen and men and promotes the economic \nindependence of women is a more prosperous society. \nIf we wish women to be able to realize their potential \nin the economic sector, we need to get rid of obstacles \nsuch as discriminatory regulations. We need to ensure \nthat women have equal access to economic resources, \nparticularly to land, credit, science and technology, \nvocational training, information, communication and \nmarkets.  \n In this regard, the Principality of Monaco wishes \nto reiterate its support for UN-Women and its \nExecutive Director, Ms. Michelle Bachelet. \n It is our shared responsibility to show our \ncommitment in the crucial gathering of 2012 \u2014 the \ntwentieth anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit \u2014 and \nto create a solid basis for the comprehensive \ndevelopment of a green economy.  \n We are seeking to develop sources of renewable \nenergy, more environmentally friendly and healthy. But \nin the short term, we are not in a position to abandon \nnuclear energy or oil. As we have learned so painfully \nthrough the Fukushima accident, we do not know \nwhether one day it will be possible to fully control all \nthe risks involved in nuclear energy. We thus continue \nto burn hydrocarbons, sending their emissions into the \natmosphere. These pitfalls pose a great danger to our \ncollective security.  \n It is time to put an end to the ideological debates \nand the divides that separate us and that delay our \nefforts to implement a green economy. \n The Secretary-General proposed that we establish \na new generation of development objectives to succeed \nthe MDGs after 2015. The Principality of Monaco \nsupports that initiative, which aims to encourage the \ninternational community to set ambitious goals and to \nprovide the wherewithal to achieve them.  \n As part of its contribution to that endeavour, \nPrince Albert II wanted Monaco to contribute actively \nto the preparatory work for the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development by organizing \nin the Principality, from 28 to 30 November 2011, a \nmeeting of high-level experts on the sustainable \nmanagement of oceans. His Serene Highness would \nlike to see the international community place the seas \nand oceans at the top of the political agenda at the \nforthcoming Earth Summit.  \n In spite of the development of a legal framework \nto govern activities in the oceans, the negative impacts \nof human activities on oceans and seas are becoming \nincreasingly visible. Marine pollution and \nunsustainable practices in the exploitation of marine \nresources are continuing to endanger marine \necosystems, to the detriment of future generations. \nClimate change has had a significant impact on oceans, \nleading to the phenomena of acidification, rising sea \nlevels and coral bleaching. Sustainable management of \nthe oceans is an essential pillar of the green economy. \n Stronger prevention measures, at the service of \nall Member States, both developed and developing, \nwill enable the Organization to carry out its role with \ngreater efficiency and flexibility. That requires the \nstrengthening of its institutions, taking greater account \nof the role of the General Assembly, balanced reform \nof the Security Council, increasing cooperation with \nregional organizations, enhanced interaction with civil \nsociety and private sector partnerships.  \n I wish to hail the leadership and political courage \nof His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, who \n \n \n13 11-51390 \n \nendeavoured to impose the moral force of the United \nNations before the eyes of the entire world.  \n The Principality of Monaco will not fail to work \nfor the improvement of global governance that our \ncommunity hopes and prays for. We share the \nconviction regarding the immense importance of the \nuniversal values upheld and defended by the \nOrganization, values to which future Members must \nadhere, as we have done. "

We hope that our meetings at the sixty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly will be fruitful and \nresult in a concrete outcome commensurate with our \naspirations for a global environment of stability, \nsecurity and lasting peace, and for the good and well-\nbeing of humanity at large.  \n We are pleased to see yet another diplomat from \nthe Gulf Cooperation Council presiding over the \nGeneral Assembly. We take this opportunity to offer \nour sincere wishes of every success to Ambassador \nNassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser in his international mission \nand of further progress and advancement at all levels \nfor his country, the brotherly State of Qatar. We also \nthank his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his able \nconduct of and contributions to the work of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. \n We would also like to express our deep \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nceaseless efforts to strengthen the role of the United \nNations in maintaining international peace and security \nand for his persistent endeavours to achieve the \nprerequisites for stability in our world, namely, \ndevelopment and collective international cooperation \nfor the benefit of the peoples of the world as a whole. \nWe also seize this opportunity to congratulate him on \nhis reappointment to a second term of office. \n There is no doubt that the world has entered a \nnew era of important changes in which the growth of \nmodern means of communication has led to rapid and \nunprecedented transformations in the world, such as \nthose that we are now experiencing in our Arab region. \nMore than a decade ago, we in the Kingdom of Bahrain \nrecognized the need to proceed towards greater reform, \nimprovement and advancement, bearing in mind the \nsupreme interest of our people, in order to satisfy their \ndemands for freedom and political participation \u2014 a \nhome-grown participation that is commensurate with \nthe heritage and history of each country and its level of \ndevelopment. Reform was also aimed at providing \ndecent living conditions, security and tranquillity in a \nsociety that enjoys peaceful coexistence, equality and \nequal opportunities for empowerment to achieve justice \nand sustainable development for all. \n In all its modernization endeavours and \nthroughout its long history, the Kingdom of Bahrain \nhas persistently followed the approach of dialogue. \nBuilding on the consensus of the people of Bahrain \naround the provisions of the National Action Charter of \n2001, we initiated a national dialogue process \ninvolving all sectors and components of the population. \nThe aim was to absorb the requirements of modern \nprogress, guarantee the continuation of the reform \nprocess, and fulfil the national aspiration to move \nforward towards comprehensive modernization and the \nenhancement of popular participation in decision-\n  \n \n11-50865 8 \n \nmaking within an all-inclusive national partnership. We \nhereby reaffirm our support for the outcome of that \ndialogue. \n The achievements of the Kingdom of Bahrain at \nthe national level are therefore an extension of a long \nhistory dating back to the beginning of the last century, \nin which we have worked to achieve a society based on \njustice, equality, progress and openness. The \nauthenticity of our people, culture, free economy, \npolitical development and firm commitment to the \nuniversal principles of human rights, peaceful \ncoexistence and respect for the views of others \nconstitute the real wealth of our country, which we \nseek to preserve and sustain for future generations. \n Today more than ever, the international \ncommunity has a propitious opportunity to do justice to \nthe brotherly Palestinian people and to help them to \nachieve their legitimate aspirations by recognizing an \nindependent Palestinian State on their own national \nsoil, with East Jerusalem as its capital. That would put \nan end to an era of bitter Arab-Israeli conflict, \ncontingent on a complete Israeli withdrawal from all \noccupied Arab territories to the lines of 4 June 1967 in \nPalestine, the occupied Syrian Arab Golan and the \noccupied territories in southern Lebanon, in accordance \nwith the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy \nand the Arab Peace Initiative. \n Committed to the security of the Arabian Gulf \nregion, we emphasize the need to resolve the issue of \nthe three occupied United Arab Emirates islands, either \nthrough direct negotiations or by referral to the \nInternational Court of Justice. With regard to \ndevelopments in the brotherly State of Yemen, the \nKingdom of Bahrain supports the Gulf Cooperation \nCouncil initiative for maintaining the security, stability \nand unity of that country and achieving the aspirations \nof its people. In this connection, we further emphasize \nthe importance of preserving the unity of Moroccan \nterritory and of resolving the issue of the Moroccan \nSahara, in accordance with the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions. \n Consistent with its commitment to concerted \ninternational action and its role and responsibilities in \nour region, the Kingdom of Bahrain has never hesitated \nto contribute to and participate in the Contact Group on \nLibya in order to help realize the aspirations of the \nLibyan people and ensure the country\u2019s unity and \nterritorial integrity. \n Bahrain is also participating in the international \npeacekeeping forces in Afghanistan in order to support \nthat country\u2019s stability and security in every sphere \u2014\npolitical, economic and security \u2014 as well as in the \nfight against international terrorism and piracy on the \nhigh seas. Bahrain also shares in the friendly American \npeople\u2019s heartfelt pain and grief over the reprehensible \nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Their resilience \nand determination, however, have helped to make their \ncountry a safer place. \n As a peace-loving nation, Bahrain will remain \nfaithful to this Organization for its historic role in \nsupporting our country\u2019s sovereignty, and for the role \nof its judiciary in ending inter-State disputes all over \nthe world, all in the interest of global stability and \ndevelopment. \n We believe that humankind in general and the \ninternational community have much to gain at the \nglobal level from the contributions of Arab-Islamic \ncivilization, as have other civilizations throughout \nhistory. Arab Muslims, Christians, Jews and other \nfollowers of other religions and beliefs can coexist \nonly in a state of civility based on tolerance. We speak \nhere in light of the experience of our country, Bahrain, \nwhich, with its characteristic openness and civilization \ndeeply rooted in history, has from time immemorial \nbeen a symbol of coexistence and interaction between \nthese human contributions. Hence its position since \nearly times as a cultural and spiritual centre in its \nnatural and human environment in the Arabian Gulf \u2014 \na position on which it has built a civil society and \nfomented a modern renaissance in the areas of \nadministrative organization, economic activity, and an \neducational and cultural enlightenment. \n While Bahrain appreciates the support of the \nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies for its \nachievements, as evidenced by the numerous awards it \nhas won in various human and social fields, we stress \nthe great importance of the global issues discussed in \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s annual report on the work of \nthe Organization (A/66/1). We are convinced that it is \nimperative that all Member States cooperate on issues \nsuch as climate change, international health, drought, \npoverty alleviation, disarmament, the non-proliferation \nof nuclear weapons and the fight against terrorism. \nThis is more urgent than ever before, given the scale of \nthe challenges and problems facing humankind, so that \nwe can create a new world of security, peace, \ntranquillity and prosperity. \n \n \n9 11-50865 \n \n In conclusion, we reaffirm our commitment to the \nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations and its \nconstructive role in consolidating peace, love and \nprosperity in the world."

        "file_text": "First of all, I \nwould like to avail myself of this opportunity to \ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \nwell-deserved reappointment, and Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \n It is with pride, a sense of responsibility and a \nwill for cooperation and proactivity that I address this \nHall in the name of the Principality of Andorra and the \nGovernment that I have the honour to represent. The \nUnited Nations and the system of international law that \nemanates from it place all States on an equal footing. \nThat is especially important for States like Andorra, \nsmall in terms of territorial dimension but large in \nvalues and in history. \n Recent years have been marked by a profound \ncrisis of multiple aspects \u2014 economic, social, \nenvironmental and political \u2014 but most especially a \ncrisis of values. Now that we must all lay the \nfoundation for recovery, we need to be quite clear \nabout the values and principles on which we wish to \ncontinue constructing the world. We do not need to go \nmuch further than the founding spirit of the General \n  \n \n11-51398 22 \n \nAssembly, an institution in which all \u2014 large and \nsmall, the wealthier and the less endowed \u2014 address \none another on equal terms to promote peace, liberty \nand justice.  \n Just as the United Nations arose after a world war \nthat turned the world as it had existed until then upside \ndown, now again we have to be able to define the \nmoral and political bases of a new order. One priority \nset by the United Nations is inclusive and sustainable \ndevelopment. There can be no sustainability without \ninclusion. And if the Assembly, which arose from the \ndebris of a devastating war, is to give a voice to all the \npeoples of the planet, we have to be capable now of \nensuring that no one is excluded from the future that \nwe forge together. \n We must take care that the economic recovery \nfrom the recession does not further accentuate the \ninequalities \u2014 understood as a lack of equity \u2014 that \nalready exist. Thus, just as international law protects \nnations like ours that have no military potential, so too \neconomic growth must be especially attentive to the \nmore vulnerable in order to prevent the consequences \nof the recession from falling systematically on them. \n Thirty years ago, in 1981, the United Nations \nheld its first Conference on the Least Developed \nCountries. The fourth Conference was held last spring, \nattesting to the difficulty of achieving significant \nchanges to improve the weakness and vulnerability of \nthose States. Further, we observe with concern how, \nagainst the background of the global recession, some of \nthe more developed countries often adopt protectionist \nattitudes. On the conviction that a freer world is a more \njust world, we also have to state that a more open and \nless protectionist world leads to a more equitable \nbalance and improvements for the disadvantaged. \n Andorra, with its small scale, secular stability and \nseclusion among mountains, is dealing with the far-\nreaching process of opening its economy. We also have \nplanned the construction of a model of inclusive \ngrowth that leaves no one out \u2014 a model that cannot \nbe constructed by turning one\u2019s back on the \ninternational community or by being isolated from the \nworld. \n I have been talking about economic opening, but \nthe opening to the world cannot be strictly economic, \nand it is crystal clear that recovery from the crisis and a \nnew phase of growth will not come about solely as a \nresult of economic measures. The search for an \ninclusive and sustainable balance must necessarily \ninvolve addressing factors that are not strictly \neconomic but that do accentuate inequalities between \ncountries. \n In that connection, we note the work done at the \n2011 High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on \nAIDS held in June and the Political Declaration on \nHIV/AIDS (resolution 65/277) adopted by the \nparticipating States, stating their intension to intensify \ntheir efforts in the fight against this pandemic. In spite \nof the advances achieved in recent years, HIV is a \nsymbol of how necessary it is for progress to reach \neveryone equally. While in the more developed \ncountries AIDS has become a chronic illness \nappropriately treated, in the more disadvantaged \nareas \u2014 especially in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 the \ndisease is still lethal, especially in the communities \nwith the fewest resources.  \n Above and beyond the increase of resources for \nresearch and treatment and greater North-South \ncooperation, I am convinced that the extension of \ndemocracy and human rights is also a key factor in the \nfight against a pandemic that overwhelms the poorest, \nbut that also hits peoples submerged in ignorance and \noppression. \n With all of that, the extent of the commitments \nmade and the progress achieved by various States in \nthe fight against HIV should be a source of \nsatisfaction, since seldom has the international \ncommunity been capable of articulating a response so \nrapid and unanimous when faced with a threat on this \nscale. It would be wonderful if the same level of \nawareness and commitment could be achieved in the \nfight against non-communicable diseases, such as \ncardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Those \nalso \u2014 although perhaps not so clearly as in the case of \nAIDS \u2014 are diseases that accentuate the inequalities \namong countries. That principle was recognized in the \nPolitical Declaration (resolution 66/2) of the High-\nlevel Meeting of the General Assembly on the \nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \nheld recently. \n Such successes cannot allow us to forget that one \nof the most serious challenges facing the international \ncommunity and this Assembly, which is its highest \nrepresentation, is the fight against climate change. To \ndate, humankind was used to overcoming recessions \nand times of crisis, entering a new phase of growth, \n \n \n23 11-51398 \n \nwithout thinking of the negative external effects of that \ngrowth. We now know that growth cannot be at any \nprice and that development must be sustainable in \neconomic terms, but also, and more particularly, in \nenvironmental terms.  \n That is why the threat of climate change is as \ngreat as or stronger than that of the global recession. \nSome developed countries, in particular those that \nsurvive on their own natural resources, are seriously \nthreatened by climate change. That may also be the \ncase for Andorra, which bases a good part of its \neconomic welfare on snow and mountain tourism. That \nis why we will always support any initiative aiming at \ngreater awareness of the need to combat climate \nchange, and take steps to adapt to what is probably \nalready a reality. In that context, we should underscore \nthe entry into force in Andorra of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change on 31 May. \n We should never lose sight of the fact that the \nmain goal of the United Nations is to guarantee peace \nand security in a context of freedom and respect for \nhuman rights. Just as in the past, States emerged to \nensure the social peace and individual freedom of their \ncitizens, the United Nations also have their raison \nd\u2019\u00eatre in the maintenance of peace and security and the \nrule of international law. \n Today, we speak of inclusive and sustainable \neconomic growth and of a new and profound awareness \nof the threat of climate change. We cannot forget that \nsuch issues are closely linked to the promotion of a \nsafer world. Growth that leaves more vulnerable \ngroups behind and that excludes the least developed \ncountries, added to the effects of climate change, leads \nto a less safe and less stable world. \n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the \ntragic attacks of 11 September here in New York, the \nseat of United Nations Headquarters. As President \nObama recalled last Wednesday (see ), we \nare today seeing the symbol of New York\u2019s renewal \nrise at ground zero, where 10 years ago there was an \nopen wound and twisted steel, a shattered heart in the \ncentre of the city. \n This year, we close the first decade of the \nmillennium without having resolved the threat to the \nsecurity of our world, that is, international terrorism. \nDespite progress on that front, the threat continues. \nTerrorism arises from hatred and wickedness. \nHowever, we must be aware that it dwells, in \nparticular, where there is a lack of economic prospects, \nilliteracy, lack of culture, poverty, marginality \u2014 \nwhere, in short, there is a lack of democracy. \n That is why, in the promotion of a safer world, \nour efforts will always be needed to combat all kinds \nof discrimination. In that regard, I wish to underscore \nthe political declaration against racism, racial \ndiscrimination and xenophobia and related intolerance \nthat was adopted at that time during the General \nAssembly. It is also 10 years since the Durban \nDeclaration and Programme of Action. Today, as the \nStates represented here, we say that we cannot afford to \nlower our guard since, in an increasingly globalized \nand complex world, the threat of discrimination is \ngrowing. \n At the beginning of my statement, I spoke of the \nneed to continue building the world on the principles \nand values that inspire this Assembly. Allow me now to \nrecall the spirit and the philosophy of the twenty-eighth \nPresident of the United States, President Wilson, father \nof the League of Nations, the precursor of today\u2019s \nUnited Nations. Wilson taught us that it was of little \nuse to be democrats at home if we were not capable of \nexporting democracy beyond our borders, and that a \nState that turned its back on countries still living under \noppression and in which the most fundamental rights \nand freedoms were not respected could not presume to \nbe democratic. \n That is why we must welcome with an especially \npositive attitude what we have called the Arab Spring. \nWe sincerely hope that those movements for \ndemocracy strengthen in the future. In that context, in \nJuly, we supported South Sudan becoming the \n193rd member of the United Nations. Today, we are \npleased at that reality and we most warmly welcome it. \nA more democratic world is a more dynamic world, but \nalso safer because it is fairer. Most failures of security \nin our world, as I said a moment ago, are fuelled by \ninjustice. \n Likewise, with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict, we must keep encouraging dialogue and \nmediation. The Palestinian people\u2019s aspiration to have \na democratic and peaceful State is as legitimate as the \nIsraeli desire to obtain guarantees for its existence and \nsecurity. The final aim of a mutual recognition of two \nStates by two peoples, on the basis of the 1967 lines \nwith the agreed and equivalent exchanges, is now \nunder discussion.  \n  \n \n11-51398 24 \n \n A possible intermediate step, in a shorter term, by \nbecoming an observer State could represent an element \nof hope for the Palestinian people, provided that it is \nnot used for purposes that are incompatible with \ncontinuing negotiations, but for the aforementioned \ngoal. Israel also must contribute to that spirit, avoiding \nattitudes that could affect the final status. \n Andorra is a country that has lived for more than \n700 years without an army, without taking part in any \nwar and without internal conflicts. The perpetual peace \nand permanent stability, of which we Andorrans are \nproud, is not founded on an autocratic regime that \ncontrols its people with an iron fist or on a whim \nresulting from the deterrence of larger or more \npowerful neighbours. No, the ultimate reason for a \npeace and security maintained for more than seven \ncenturies has been the ongoing effort to respect \nindividual rights and freedoms and the rule of justice \nand of fairness, and the existence of mechanisms of \nsolidarity, as was well demonstrated in the recent \nuniversal periodic review. \n Our democracy and our centuries-old \nparliamentary system are not the fruit of peace and \nstability, but the reverse. Peace, security and stability \nare the fruits of democracy because, without \ndemocracy, there is no possibility of peace or lasting \nsecurity either in Andorra or anywhere in the world. \n From the position of humility that governs our \nsupport for the United Nations, we wish to reaffirm \nhere the idea of commitment as a fundamental value \nand the linchpin of our political action. That \ncommitment is understood as a deep belief not only in \npeace and equal opportunities, but also as an \ninvolvement in and shouldering of individual \nresponsibilities regarding a common project and, last \nbut not least, as a wish for dialogue and understanding. \nOn Wednesday, President Sarkozy stated in this \nAssembly: \u201cLet us choose the path of compromise, \nwhich is neither renunciation nor repudiation, but \nwhich allows us to move forward, step by step\u201d \n(). Andorra will continue to work towards \nsuch a commitment within the Organization. "

We are also moving forward with \nindustrial processing projects, beginning with wood, \nmanganese and gas. In addition, we are also making \nprogress with policies to support the service sector. In \nterms of agriculture, we intend to develop agro-industries, \nand to support food production and sustainable fishing, \nwhich are both so valuable for our food security. \n Finally, we are working on a daily basis to \nimplement our steadfast commitment to sustainable \ndevelopment in the context of a green Gabon. \n With regard to international peace and security in \nAfrica and throughout the world, Gabon has reiterated \nits commitment and has contributed according to its \nmeans. Since 2010, we have had a non-permanent seat \non the Security Council. Last June, Gabon held the \nPresidency of that body, a role that we discharged with \nresponsibility and commitment. \n Turning to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Gabon has endorsed the \nactions taken by the United Nations, aimed at \nrespecting the will of the Ivorian people and ensuring \nthe return to a peaceful political environment. We must \nnow support the efforts of the new Government to \nachieve national reconciliation and reconstruction in \nour sister country. \n With regard to Libya, Gabon has recognized the \nNational Transitional Council and welcomes Libya\u2019s \nreturn to the African Union and to the international \ncommunity at the United Nations. In the Security \nCouncil, along with the other two African members, we \napproved resolution 1973 (2011). It was incumbent on \nthe international community to prevent the bloodbath \nthat threatened to take place in Benghazi. We also \nneeded to cut short a conflict that posed great danger to \nthe civilian population. Today, it is important that \nLibya emerge from this crisis in order to begin \nreconciliation for all Libyans and the reconstruction of \nthe country. It is with this aim in mind that we took \npart in the conference of friends of Libya in Paris. We \nwelcome the role played by the United Nations. It is \nimportant to work together with the African Union and \nother stakeholders. We are ready to contribute to the \nefforts of the international community in Libya. \n South Sudan has also joined the international \ncommunity. Gabon congratulates the authorities of that \nnewborn sister country and assures it of our support. \nWe welcome the clear determination of Sudan and \nSouth Sudan to seek a peaceful way to settle their post-\nreferendum issues. \n In Somalia, we must act resolutely because of the \nserious and urgent nature of the situation. Everything \nmust be done to deliver humanitarian aid to those who \nneed it in the towns and villages in Somalia itself. \nGabon responded to the appeal of the international \ncommunity and has made a contribution. \n The issue of Palestine affects us all, so far-\nreaching are its implications for peace in the Middle \nEast and throughout the world. It is important to stress \nthat we all share the goal, which is the existence of two \nStates, Palestine and Israel. On this question, I wish to \nexpress my desire, as I did here in this Hall last year \nand do this year with even greater hope, namely, to see \nsoon a Palestinian State that exists in peace alongside \nIsrael, within secure and recognized borders. The \nIsraeli and Palestinian peoples, both friends of Gabon, \naspire to live in peace and security. The peaceful future \nof these two peoples is essential for the future of the \nMiddle East and for peace in the world. \n Syria represents a new situation that requires \nefforts on all our parts. We hope that the Arab League\u2019s \n \n \n23 11-50871 \n \nmediation efforts will ensure a peaceful and democratic \noutcome as a matter of urgency. \n Gabon will be particularly attentive to the priority \nissues throughout this sixty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Gabon is, of course, in favour of \nreform of the Security Council and reform of the \nUnited Nations system in general. We must enable our \nOrganization to better discharge its mission of peace, \ncooperation and justice throughout the world.  \n Africa should, in a manner that remains to be \ndetermined, have a permanent seat in the Security \nCouncil. Africa\u2019s voice must be heard more on the \ninternational stage. This expectation on the part of \nAfrica and even other regions of the world is part of \nour aspirations for a true democratization of global \npolitical and economic governance.  \n As you know, Gabon is fully committed, \nincluding within the framework of the United Nations, \nto protecting the environment and combating global \nwarming. Since I assumed the highest office in my \ncountry, Gabon has taken major steps to reduce its \ncarbon dioxide emissions and to increase the carbon \nsequestration rate of our forests. My Government has \ncommitted itself to modern ways of preserving our \ntropical forests and biodiversity within our 13 national \nparks, which cover a little more than 11 per cent of our \nterritory. Gabon has thus launched an extensive \ncampaign to prevent the pillaging of its natural \nresources and the poaching of its protected species. We \nare striving to develop our timber industry, while \npreserving the ecological wealth of our immense \ntropical forest.  \n We should also recall that the issues of the \nenvironment and international security will face us in \nthe future. At the coming United Nations Climate \nChange Conference in Durban, in South Africa, we will \nhave to deal with that complex of issues in our work \nand bear in mind the link that exists between the \nenvironment and international security.  \n Finally, we are closely following the efforts under \nway to delineate the limits of the continental shelf. \nGiven the potential of undersea resources, we should \nensure that their future exploitation does not lead to \nnatural disasters. \n Gabon is concerned by the impact of the \neconomic crisis on countries of the South, particularly \nin terms of achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. The impact of the international financial crisis \non public investment in basic social sectors, such as \neducation, health and the provision of drinking water \nand electricity, is constraining our efforts to promote \nhuman development.  \n Despite significant progress in implementing the \nMillennium Development Goals, the deadline of 2015 \nremains for many countries, including Gabon, a \ndifficult challenge to meet. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals cannot be achieved unless \nadditional funds are mobilized before 2015. \nDevelopment assistance is stagnating, and I see real \nconcern as a result of the situation. The international \ncommunity must make an effort to live up to the \ncommitments it agreed to in Monterey, Doha, \nGleneagles, Paris and Accra. We need a new global \npartnership for development to ensure lasting economic \ngrowth in our countries. Aid should be accompanied by \nmore direct investment and more fair and equitable \ntrade. To mobilize new resources, we encourage and \nsupport the efforts under way aimed at \ninstitutionalizing innovative mechanisms for funding \ndevelopment. \n The President of the General Assembly has asked \nus to discuss the issue of mediation. This issue is at the \nheart of the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre of our Organization, \nwhich is to guarantee peace and security throughout \nthe world.  \n Mediation and conflict prevention must remain \nour primary means of collective action. We all feel the \nneed, in a complex world, to achieve greater \ndemocracy, a world where economic and cultural \nexchanges are better balanced and where crisis \nprevention, whether it be of political or other crises, is \nbetter organized, with, in particular, better early \nwarning systems and mediation.  \n Gabon is historically attached to mediation and to \nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. This approach has \nalways been one of the bases of our relations with our \nneighbouring and brotherly countries in the Central \nAfrican subregion and has played a part in our \ncontribution to the resolution of conflicts in Africa. My \ncountry will never depart from that path, in particular \nat the very moment when Africa is striving to achieve \npolitical and economic integration.  \n Our commitment to the peaceful settlement of \nconflicts is also part of the commitments that we have \nundertaken under a number of conventions and treaties \n  \n \n11-50871 24 \n \non human rights, humanitarian law, the promotion of \ndemocracy and the rule of law, and international \ncooperation and solidarity.  \n We are well aware that mediation has its limits, \nand the international community must always be ready, \nif necessary, to consider other ways of ensuring \nconflict prevention and conflict resolution. Conflicts \nwill be more complex and multidimensional in the \nfuture. Economic crises, environmental crises and \naspirations for democracy and freedoms, which are \ntaking on new forms, will worsen tensions, and we \nmust follow these developments closely. \n Gabon will continue to support and contribute to \nthe mediation efforts and good offices of the Secretary-\nGeneral on several different fronts and in the various \nareas of the world where there are conflicts. Those \nefforts are essential. They must be enhanced by \nincreased resources and be carried out in an impartial \nway, with full respect for the sovereignty of States. It \nshould also be said that the participation of women is \nimportant in all aspects of mediation, since they are \nalways the first victims of conflicts, along with \nchildren.  \n Finally, the United Nations must enhance its \ncooperation with all the other actors playing a role in \nthis area. In Africa, the African Union, which continues \nto enhance its mediation capacities, is an essential \nplayer. \n I would like to conclude by recalling the motto of \nmy vision for our society aimed at making Gabon an \nemerging country: peace, development and sharing. \nThe climate of peace and stability that Gabon is now \nenjoying will be invaluable as our country enters a new \nphase of rapid modernization. More than ever before, \nGabon wishes to cooperate with other countries. We \nare deeply committed to peace. The people of Gabon \nare therefore ready to exchange, create and build with \nthe rest of the world. "

        "file_text": "I \nshould like at the outset to convey to you, Sir, my \nheartfelt and sincere congratulations on your well-\ndeserved election as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-sixth session and to wish you every success \nin discharging your mandate.  \n I should like also to reiterate my heartfelt \ncongratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \nreappointment as Secretary-General. I assure him of \nthe full cooperation of the Government of Benin and \nthe personal support of its Head of State in the vast \n \n \n37 11-51670 \n \nundertaking that is the modernization of the United \nNations, which he has been working towards since he \ntook the helm of the Organization.  \n I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute \nto Mr. Joseph Deiss for the outstanding manner in \nwhich he carried out his mission as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. \n I should like to commend the selection of the \ntheme of the sixty-sixth session, \u201cThe role of mediation \nin the peaceful settlement of disputes\u201d. This reflects a \nrecognition of the importance of dialogue and of the \nresponsibility of third parties in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. \n Conflicts, crises and wars represent a large part \nof the challenges faced by humankind. They undermine \npoorer States, whose efforts are often undone by \nindiscriminate violence, as deadly as it is destructive.  \n This legitimate interest in the use of mediation \nshould serve as a catalyst for raising the awareness of \nstakeholders in all regions of the world as to the need \nto accord greater importance to dialogue in resolving \nproblems, nationally and in the context of inter-State, \nbilateral, regional and international relations. \n We would therefore like to commend the \npartnership between the United Nations and the \nAfrican Union within the context of the special \npolitical missions, which are an optimum framework \nfor mediation. Such partnerships can help to avert \nredundancy and duplication, which can be counter-\nproductive and doom mediation efforts to failure. \n Benin, for its part, which owes much to dialogue, \nvery early on grasped the importance of that tool in the \nprevention and resolution of crises at the national level. \nIn that respect, I believe it appropriate here to draw the \nattention of the international community to the fact that \nthe Government of Benin has given high priority to the \nissue of mediation in its programme of action and, in \nthat context, established the Office of the Ombudsman. \nWe would also like to commend the creation, at the \nregional level, of the Association of Ombudsmen of \nMember Countries of the West African Economic and \nMonetary Union, which Benin chairs; indeed, most of \nthe countries in the Union are relying on this important \ntool for the maintenance of peace. \n Perhaps we should go even further and establish \ncivil entities for mediation and the restoration of peace, \nwhose members would meet with the parties to a \nconflict so as to re-establish dialogue among them and \nto prevail upon them to resolve their disputes \npeacefully. \n The current state of the world makes clear the \nurgent need to strengthen multilateralism, with a view \nto averting the collective collapse that could result if \nappropriate or consensual solutions are not rapidly \nfound to the global problems afflicting the world today. \nAt the national level, we require greater cohesion \namong the vital forces of the country and greater \ndetermination in the context of actions aimed at \neliminating the obstacles that impede development. \nWith respect to preserving democratic institutions, \nwhen the fundamental values enshrined in the Charter \nare at stake, the United Nations must be at the forefront \nof the efforts of the international community. \n In that regard, impartiality cannot be synonymous \nwith neutrality, which would be unfathomable and \nmake the United Nations a passive bystander to the \ntriumph of aggression over the rule of law. I should \ntherefore like to thank the Secretary-General for the \ncourageous choices he has made.  \n In Benin, democracy has been strengthened by \nthe tireless commitment of the United Nations to \nensuring electoral transparency, which it accomplished \nthrough its support for the creation of a computerized \npermanent voters\u2019 list, which prevents any \nmanipulation or other fraudulent manoeuvres and \nthereby ensures fairness in our country\u2019s elections. \n Based on the success of our young democracy in \nBenin, my Government has been working to \nconsolidate cooperative governance at both the \nnational and local levels, so as to maximize the impact \nof the resources that have been mobilized and \nearmarked for the promotion of the well-being of all \nthe citizens of our country. Accordingly, far-reaching \nreforms have been undertaken to reorganize the State \nand rid the country of the structural and behavioural \nincoherence that has impeded the State in its efforts to \ngovern effectively. \n The strengthening of democratic institutions and \na fresh balance of powers is at the very heart of the \nconstitutional review that is under discussion. Such a \nreview must in no way affect the principal mechanisms \nthat ensure the alternance of power, that is, the number \nof terms allowed the President of the Republic \u2014 \nstrictly limited to two \u2014 and the age limitation of \n  \n \n11-51670 38 \n \n70 years, beyond which one cannot run for the highest \noffice in Benin. \n The fight against corruption is a crucial aspect of \nthat effort to streamline the State apparatus. The \nadoption in late August 2011 of a new law to fight \ncorruption is in keeping with the national dynamic of \nensuring transparency in the management of the State\u2019s \nresources and in the resolute fight undertaken against \nany practices that deny citizens the ability fully to \nenjoy the fruits of their labour. That new law enables \nus to better combat the various forms of illicit \nenrichment, as today it is up to the accused to justify \nthe source of his wealth, not the accuser. This is a \nrevolutionary development in the context Benin\u2019s \njudicial and legislative mechanisms. \n At the global level, we believe in the benefits of \nmultilateralism. That is why we see an ever greater \nneed for the United Nations, which should be given a \nmore assertive role in global governance \u2014 a United \nNations that would spearhead and lead of actions \naimed at promoting, within an inclusive framework, \ncomprehensive and sustainable solutions to the \nmanifold crises that are affecting the world and having \ndirect repercussions for human rights.  \n Our Government, throughout its term in the \nHuman Rights Council, intends, together with other \nmembers of the Council, to work to promote and \nprotect universally recognized human rights, in a spirit \nof cooperation. Benin firmly believes in the \nuniversality, the indivisibility and the interdependence \nof all human rights. It has faith in international \ncooperation as the most effective means for promoting \nand protecting all universally recognized human rights. \n Let us recognize the ongoing efforts made in past \nyears by each of our countries, and collectively through \ninternational organizations both regional and universal, \nto manage the consequences of the various crises that \naffect the world, particularly developing countries \u2014 \nfood, energy, financial, economic and environmental \ncrises.  \n However, the international economic situation \nremains sluggish and uncertain. Indeed, the long-\nawaited international economic recovery remains slow \nand tenuous, while financial and stock market \nturbulence continues to affect the international market. \n Even today, more than two thirds of the \n800 million people in the least developed countries \n(LDCs) are living in poverty. The economic indicators \nof those nations \u2014 which have made prodigious efforts \nand heavy sacrifices to emerge from underdevelopment \u2014 \ncall for great prudence with regard to attaining the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \n Despite that rather bleak picture, we should \ncontinue our efforts to ensure that our countries can \nmake progress in the spheres of good governance, \ndevelopment, health, water, sanitation, primary \neducation for all and the empowerment of women and \nyouth. \n The developing countries, particularly the LDCs, \nneed more than ever the transfer of modern technology \nto increase and diversify production, take a greater part \nin international trade and build the infrastructure \nrequired for development. The developed countries and \nthe countries of the South that are experiencing \nsignificant economic growth should establish facilities \nto that end, as was agreed at the Fourth United Nations \nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in \nIstanbul from 9 to 13 May 2011. The new programme \nof action adopted at that Conference clearly reflects \nour shared ambition to ensure that half those countries \nmove to the category of middle-income nations by \n2020.  \n But however noble the goals set forth in the \nIstanbul Programme of Action may be, they cannot be \nachieved unless we respect the commitments already \nmade. For that reason, despite the cyclical difficulties \nthat characterize the current global economic situation, \nwe must remain firm in our resolve to move forward.  \n There is no stable financial support for the \ndevelopment efforts of the LDCs without stable \nsources of financing. Therefore the Government of \nBenin strongly supports the innovative financing \ninitiative for development. We call on the nations of \nthe Group of 20 to take a closer look at that initiative \nso that taxation of financial transactions becomes a \ntangible reality during the weeks and months to come. \n Threats related to climate change \u2014 particularly \nthe continuing deterioration of the environment and \ndrought, a source of famine in some parts of Africa \u2014 \nand the recurrence of natural disasters greatly \nundermine the future prospects of the LDCs.  \n Benin commends the United Nations preparatory \nwork for the Rio+20 Summit planned for Brazil in June \n2012. We hope those meetings will lead to robust \n \n \n39 11-51670 \n \nmeasures and decisions that match the perils that await \nus. \n The threats that curtail our ambitions stem from \nother factors as well, such as the surge in transnational \norganized crime, which is quite pernicious. My \ncountry, Benin, has in recent months been the target of \nextremely serious and savage acts of piracy, armed \nrobbery at sea and an influx of narcotics and \ncounterfeit medicines. This scourge has not spared \nother countries of the Gulf of Guinea, which have also \nbeen affected to varying degrees. We are particularly \ndistressed not only by the escalating number of such \nattacks and the increasingly sophisticated methods the \npirates employ, but also and especially by the \nexpansion of their field of action and the immediate \neffect of these attacks on port activities in Benin. \n That situation complicates Benin\u2019s efforts to find \nthe resources to handle the economic and financial \ndifficulties related to external shocks, the repercussions \nof which severely impact the economy of small \ncountries like ours. It also seriously hampers our \nability to achieve the MDGs. The Government of \nBenin is working with our neighbour Nigeria to \nmobilize the countries of the Gulf of Guinea subregion \nfor a coordinated response by developing and \nimplementing a regional approach that involves joint \nmanoeuvres to be launched shortly by the armed forces \nof Benin and Nigeria along the coast of Benin. \n I call for the effective solidarity of States with \nexpertise in the area of maritime operations to come to \nour assistance. Our resources are laughable, given the \nmagnitude of the threat. Clearly, the fight against \npiracy requires technical and financial resources that a \ndeveloping State cannot provide alone. Here I would \nlike to thank the United States, France, China and other \ncountries that have already shown spontaneous \nsolidarity toward Benin. \n The matters to which we need to find solutions \ngrow ever more complex. The United Nations must \ncontinually improve its ability to closely define the \nchallenges facing humanity and to help States \nformulate appropriate responses while preserving the \ndelicate balance of interests of all stakeholders, as \nevidence of its efficiency and efficacy.  \n Along these lines, the negotiations to reform the \nSecurity Council must be intensified with the adoption \nof a specific timetable for their outcome, to be \ncredible. My sense is that 2015 could be considered a \ndeadline for completing negotiations and establishing \nan inclusive Security Council that would redress the \nhistorical injustice done to Africa with respect to its \npermanent representation in that body, which crowns \nthe collective security system established by the United \nNations Charter.  \n Benin says no, no, and a third time no. The time \nhas come to put an end to an intolerable injustice that \nexcludes an entire continent \u2014 the only one, Africa \u2014 \nfrom the supreme decision-making body with respect \nto international security.  \n I am certain that completion of Security Council \nreform will lead to greater trust and less suspicion in \nthe management of today\u2019s great challenges in the \nrealm of international peace and security. \n My country has always advocated strengthening \nconflict prevention as a means to ensure international \npeace and security at less cost. Efforts to that end must \nbe tirelessly pursued.  \n Prevention also includes effectively supporting \nyoung people to prepare them for their responsibilities, \nprotect them from the risks they face and channel their \nenergies towards participation in the development of \ntheir countries. We need to remove the obstacles that \ndeter or prevent them from fulfilling their potential and \ndivert them to risky behaviour of all kinds that harm \npublic order and the stability of States.  \n That is why my Government was firmly \ncommitted to the holding of the United Nations High-\nlevel Meeting on Youth. Now that it has taken place, \nwe need to do our utmost to ensure that its conclusions \non youth are translated into specific actions as soon as \npossible. The great interest in that High-level Meeting \nshown by young people around the world reflects their \nwill to become more involved in the search for \nappropriate solutions to the challenges facing \nhumankind.  \n The Government of my country also believes that \nit would be useful for the United Nations to hold youth \nhearings every year, or every other year, to enable \nyouth from around the world to address a specific \nsubject, with broad participation of young delegates \nand young leaders of non-governmental organizations. \nSuch regular mobilization of the world\u2019s young people \nin the heart of the United Nations would make our \nworld Organization more inclusive and closer to our \npeoples.  \n  \n \n11-51670 40 \n \n For us in Benin \u2014 and I quote the President of \nthe Republic, Mr. Boni Yayi \u2014 \u201cthere is no doubt that \nonly those societies that give young people \nopportunities will be able to meet the challenges to \ncome\u201d. \n From 16 to 20 November 2010, Benin hosted an \ninternational symposium on the fiftieth anniversary of \nthe independence of African countries. That meeting \nculminated in the drafting of an important historic \ndocument entitled \u201cThe Fiftieth Anniversary \nManifesto\u201d. The African Union, at its most recent \nsummit, held in Malabo on 30 June and 1 July, adopted \nthe Manifesto as a reference document for the \nrenaissance of the African continent.  \n The Anniversary Manifesto details, in the context \nof globalization, felicitous prospects with regard the \nchallenges facing Africa in the coming 50 years, which \nwill require new partnership approaches to promote \ndevelopment and more effective collective action for \nthe renaissance of the continent. I firmly hope that the \nManifesto will be taken to heart equally by the United \nNations and lead to synergy and better coordination of \nefforts to mobilize the international community for the \neconomic development of African countries so as to \nmeet the legitimate aspirations of the people of the \ncontinent. \n In conclusion, I want to note that recent history \nteaches us that the greatest threats to international \npeace and security come from peoples who have long \nbeen frustrated. The Palestinian question makes the \nArab nation a frustrated nation. The United Nations \ntoday has the means to find a just and lasting solution \nto the Palestinian problem, and it must not fail to meet \nits historic responsibility.  \n We support a free and independent Palestinian \nState living in peaceful coexistence with the State of \nIsrael. Benin gives ongoing support to the one-land, \ntwo-State solution and calls upon the Security Council \nto facilitate the prompt resolution of the problem, to \nbring relief to the Palestinian people, who endure daily \nsuffering.  \n We believe in the virtue of mediation. The choice \nof that option as a way to resolve conflicts around the \nworld in this sixty-sixth session of the Assembly offers \na last chance for the two parties to re-engage in \ndialogue to finally bring lasting peace to the Middle \nEast and to the world. The peace that we all so wish for \nmust be based on universal respect for the cardinal \nprinciples and fundamental values contained in the \nUnited Nations Charter. "

        "file_text": "Not since the \nprelude to the two world wars have there been so much \nuncertainty and anxiety within the international system. \nThe sands are indeed shifting, as the President of the \nAssembly stressed at the opening of this sixty-sixth \nsession (see A/66/PV.1). \n The shifts in the struggles for freedom and the \nstruggles for rights, some of which we in Saint Lucia \ntake for granted; the shifts in the number of natural \ndisasters that devastate country after country; financial \nmeltdowns, increases in the price of energy and food, \nand food shortages have all converged and met at a \nmoment when the challenge to cope weighs upon us \nall. However, the weight carried by a small island State \nbears down like an elephant on an ant, and although the \nant is capable of carrying many times its own weight, it \nwould never choose to carry an elephant.  \n The current world economic and financial \nsituations are not of our making but they affect us more \nthan anybody else. It continues to confound us how the \nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), with \nthe exception of Haiti of course \u2014 small island States \nlike us, with limited resources, limited populations, \nlimited land mass and small economies \u2014 can be \nclassified as middle-income. With that classification, \nwe are not eligible for special arrangements in finance \nand trade. There must be something wrong with that \nclassification. We continue to argue that the \nmethodology employed for such categorization puts \nsmall island developing States (SIDS) at a great \ndisadvantage in terms of receiving favourable aid and \ntrade packages, thereby adversely affecting our \ndevelopment strategies. \n The continued attrition of trade preferences at the \nmultilateral level challenges our very small \u2014 and, I \nreiterate, very vulnerable \u2014 economies and requires \nour Governments to employ creative structural \narrangements and adjustments and fiscal exercises to \nkeep our economies afloat. The present application of \nthe terms of trade and conditions of aid are very \nunfavourable to us. \n Emphasis therefore has to be placed on the \nconsideration of a balanced approach to foreign \ninvestment and environmental integrity, and investors \nmust not place undue pressure on small States. Rather, \nthere should be an understanding of our challenges and \nour willingness to work in a win-win situation. \nFavourable mechanisms for finance and technology \ntransfer would enable small island States to take \nadvantage of the benefits that these offer as \nprerequisites for sustainable development. This is all \nwe ask, nothing more \u2014 a chance to claim our part. \n We stress our vulnerability to natural disasters \nand their disproportionate effect on small island \neconomies, and we seek rapid and meaningful response \nmechanisms at the regional and international levels in \norder to enable our vulnerable economies to recover as \nquickly as possible. Almost every year, gains made \nduring the first half of the year are eroded in the last \nquarter by weather-related phenomena. \n Saint Lucia is still recovering from Hurricane \nTomas, which struck the island in October 2010. Let \nme take this opportunity to thank those who \ncontributed so generously to our recovery. Of course, \nwe will still accept any generous contributions. \n Saint Lucia, like other SIDS, recognizes the vital \nrole that oceans play in national and global economic \ndevelopment. In light of this, the Government of Saint \nLucia remains committed to ensuring the sustainable \ndevelopment of both coastal and marine resources.  \n For a number of years now, Saint Lucia has had \nlegislation in place that speaks to effective fisheries \nmanagement with laws on open and closed seasons for \ncertain fisheries such as lobsters and, in order to \nprevent the capture of juvenile fish, mesh-size limits \nfor nets and fish-trap fisheries. The Government is also \ntargeting large pelagic fish and other species not \ntraditionally harvested by local fishers, in order to \nreduce pressure on coastal and reef fishing. In addition, \na number of marine reserves and marine management \nareas have been established, with the most well-known \nof these being the Soufriere Marine Management \nAssociation, which has been used to inform the \nestablishment of other marine parks within the \nCaribbean and, I may add, globally.\n The Government of Saint Lucia has adopted an \ninstitutional framework for integrated coastal zone \nmanagement and is working towards ensuring its \nsuccessful implementation through a Caribbean coastal \nzone management unit and a coastal zone management \nadvisory committee. \n  \n \n11-51687 8 \n \n I dwell on the issue of oceans and seas because \nthe impacts of climate change and sea-level rise are \nreal to SIDS, and Saint Lucia, through a number of \nprojects and programmes, is seeking to build the \nisland\u2019s resilience to these impacts through the formal \nadoption of a national building code and the \ndevelopment of environmental impact, physical \nplanning and development regulations.  \n Nevertheless, Saint Lucia has recognized the \nimportance of having access to data and models at the \nnational and local levels in defining and informing the \ncountry\u2019s response to climate change, and in this regard \nis taking a number of steps to build the requisite \ndatabase by working with various national, regional \nand global organizations. \n The Caribbean Sea is an important international \nshipping route for both tourism and trade. Considered \nby the United Nations Environment Programme \n(UNEP) to be a biodiversity hotspot, the Caribbean Sea \nis and will remain our livelihood. It keeps us afloat, but \nit can also drown us if we do not manage it properly; \nthat is what seas do. It therefore needs special \nattention, and our Government is promoting an \nintegrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea \narea in the context of sustainable development. We \ntherefore support the work of the UNEP Caribbean \nEnvironment Programme, and we hope that funding \nwill be made available to that programme to enable us \nto achieve our goals. \n For all these reasons, Saint Lucia would like to \ncall on the international community to ensure that there \nis a strong focus on oceans in the preparatory \nnegotiations for the upcoming United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). We \ncannot forget the importance of oceans to SIDS in \nproviding energy and food security, and to the world as \na whole in regulating our climate. Oceans are a \nregulatory mechanism for climate. \n As countries worldwide prepare for the Rio+20 \nEarth summit, we note that the green economy is a \nmajor theme for discussion. Renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency are at the heart of the green economy. \nPetroleum giants like British Petroleum and Shell are \nnow turning to investments in solar and wind energy. \nCountries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Brazil \nhave positioned themselves as strong proponents of \nrenewable energy. Sustainable energy technologies \nhave been and continue to be a subject of significant \nresearch and development, with very promising results.  \n At the policy level, a number of countries, \nincluding my own, have articulated noble and \nambitious energy policies to steer us into the future. In \nnegotiations taking place pursuant to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nclimate change mitigation is inextricably linked to \nsustainable energy development and continues to \ngenerate much debate as State parties seek to find \nlasting solutions to the problem of greenhouse gas \nemissions. \n But while the United Nations endeavours to \npromote equity and equality among individual \ncountries, our capacities are not the same. Countries \nlike ours yearn to enjoy the benefits of sustainable, \nrenewable energy sources, but despite having \nsignificant potential for renewable energy, we have not \nyet been able to meaningfully develop these resources. \nIt is therefore imperative that the international \ncommunity take decisive action to assist small island \nStates, isolated as we are, in achieving energy security \nthrough renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprogrammes. Financing is a critical element in the \ndevelopment of new and renewable forms of energy. \n So far, SIDS have largely been overlooked, as \ninvestments are made in larger economies where \ngreater economies of scale and profits beckon. Even \nwith the existence of avenues such as the clean \ndevelopment mechanism, which should also promote \nsustainable energy projects, the results have not been \nvery encouraging for SIDS. We hope that, not too long \nfrom now, that situation may change. \n We applaud the efforts and resources put into the \nconservation and preservation of the world\u2019s forests to \nreverse desertification. We think, however, that \nconsiderable attention should also be given to what I \nterm \u201csmall stands of trees\u201d in our small island States. \nAlthough we call them forests, to those who have very \nlarge forests they are small stands of trees, but they are \nimportant to us because they are critical and crucial to \nsoil fertility and therefore guarantee production and \nproductivity in agriculture, thereby promoting food \nsecurity and the alleviation of poverty. \n Similarly, Saint Lucia welcomes the adoption of \nthe Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing \nand is grateful to the Government of Japan for \nproviding an implementation fund for developing \n \n \n9 11-51687 \n \ncountries. We see that as a great opportunity to help \nour communities to benefit from their biological \nresources and the traditional knowledge associated \nwith them, so that they too can play their role in the \nconservation of biological diversity. In accordance with \nthe declaration of 2011-2020 as the United Nations \nDecade on Biodiversity, we urge all countries to work \nclosely together to conserve biological resources for \nthe present day and posterity. \n The recently concluded High-level Meeting on \nnon-communicable Diseases provided an opportunity \nto deepen relations and collaboration with Member \nStates, regional and international agencies and \ndevelopment partners, and to share technical expertise, \nbest practices and resources as we continue to strive to \nmeet clearly defined goals and objectives. As a \nmember of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), \nwhich spearheaded this initiative, Saint Lucia wishes to \nplace on record its appreciation for the commitment of \nall Member States, United Nations agencies, \nparticularly the World Health Organization, and other \ninterested groups in addressing the scourge of \nnon-communicable diseases. We nevertheless need to \nset targets, implement programmes and measure \nsuccess if we are to make progress beyond just another \nmeeting. \n Saint Lucia, like all of the other CARICOM \nmember States, is grappling with security threats \nengendered by the illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons and trafficking in narcotics. The associated \nrise in crime and violence involving the use of firearms \nhas had a significant adverse effect on the socio-\neconomic and human development of our countries. \nSaint Lucia will therefore spare no effort in working \ntowards concluding an arms trade treaty that is legally \nbinding, robust and comprehensive; contains the \nhighest possible standard for the transfer of \nconventional arms, including small arms, light \nweapons and ammunition; is effective in regulating the \narms trade, particularly in preventing diversion; and is \nuniversal in subscription. \n Saint Lucia welcomes the Republic of South \nSudan as the most recent member of our community \nand wishes it progress, peace and prosperity. We look \nforward to welcoming the State of Palestine to this \nbody after successful negotiations have been \nconcluded. That is our hope. \n The anachronistic, half-century blockade imposed \non the people of our neighbour, Cuba, suffocates that \npeople\u2019s right to prosperity and progress. The outdated \nmechanism\u2019s illogical application does not fit twenty-\nfirst century geopolitics, economics or \nhumanitarianism. We therefore add our voice to others \nthat have spoken before us in calling for an end to this \nblockade and to all limitations on the rights of the \nCuban people to progress and prosperity. \n In the spirit of the greater good, we are pleased \nthat, since 2009, Taiwan has been able to participate in \nthe World Health Association (WHA), in recognition of \nthe fact that global health issues require universal \nparticipation and cooperation to overcome those major \nproblems that affect the peoples of every corner of the \nglobe. \n Sustainable development, like health, is one of \nthose issues that require global participation and \ncooperation. Taiwan is a leading economic and \ntechnological powerhouse and can contribute \nsubstantially not only to health but to a range of global \nissues that face the world today. We urge the United \nNations to find suitable means to permit Taiwan to \nparticipate in its specialized agencies and mechanisms, \nincluding the International Civil Aviation Organization \nand the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change all of which have worldwide \nimplications, along the lines of the WHA model. \nSurely, 25 million people living on planet Earth can \ncontribute to this body of peoples. \n In conclusion, the shifting sands are revealing an \ninternational system on the brink of change. We are at \na moment when a decision taken here in this great \nAssembly will reverberate throughout history. \nDecisions taken here can create a State or divide a \nState; they can bring peace or bring renewed conflict. \nThe theme for this general debate \u2014 \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d was well chosen. Let it guide our work this \nyear and beyond. "

        "file_text": "First of all, let me say \nhow pleased I am to come before the General \nAssembly and to address it on behalf of His Excellency \nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the Republic of \nMalawi. The President was unable to attend due to \nother State commitments, but he sends his greetings to \nyou, Sir, the Secretary-General and all the peoples of \nthe United Nations.  \n At the outset, I would like to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly. Your election is a \nmanifestation of the confidence that the people of the \nUnited Nations have in your leadership. I wish you \nwell as you lead this body in the next several months. \n Allow me also to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss, the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, for his \neffective leadership during his tenure. I had the \nopportunity of working with him in Istanbul, and he \nwas very helpful to me personally as a new participant \nin those international activities. He also showed much \ninterest in Africa. I hope that, whatever he does in \nfuture, he will continue to show interest in Africa.  \n Let me also take the opportunity to congratulate \nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his unanimous reappointment as \nSecretary-General. His endorsement has demonstrated \nthe international community\u2019s confidence in his \nleadership. I remember his visit to Malawi this past \nyear, when he came to visit the Millennium Village. \nThe people of Mwandama village anxiously await his \nreturn, and they have sent word through me to ask him, \nwhenever he has time, to come back to Malawi.  \n Let me take this opportunity to join other \nspeakers in congratulating our brothers and sisters of \nSouth Sudan for achieving their independence. I am \nparticularly excited about this because, when South \nSudan gained its independence, Malawi was Chair of \nthe African Union and played a small part in its \nemergence as an independent State. I am very excited \nabout that. The emergence of South Sudan is, I believe, \na good manifestation of the importance of mediation \nand negotiation in the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means. There is no question in my mind that \nthe remaining issues that exist between South Sudan \nand the Sudan will also be resolved in a peaceful \nmanner. I therefore wish them well. \n The theme of this general debate is \u201cThe role of \nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans\u201d. I consider this an opportune time to discuss \nthat particular issue because today we are faced with \nnew problems, including inter-State and intra-State \nproblems. There is a new phenomenon of people who \nbecome divided over ethnic, linguistic, religious or \ncultural differences within States. Methods must \ntherefore be found to resolve disputes within States. \n I therefore wish to commend the United Nations \nand to encourage the establishment of durable \nmechanisms to ensure that disputes between and within \nStates are resolved in a peaceful manner. In that \ncontext, I congratulate the African Union, regional \norganizations and other international organizations for \nthe mediation work they have done, especially in \nAfrica. I would like to encourage developing countries, \nespecially African States, to make sure to adopt the \npractice of resolving disputes in universities and to \ntrain people at regional and local levels in dispute \nsettlement and resolution techniques. \n There are a number of issues facing the United \nNations and the world, but my country has identified \nfive that I hope will be put at the forefront of the \nUnited Nations agenda at this and future sessions. The \nfirst issue is that of disaster relief and management. \nDisasters have now become a major problem in most of \nour countries. They strain the resources of the least \ndeveloped countries, particularly in Africa. We face \nproblems of floods, heavy rains, droughts, earthquakes, \nheavy winds and hurricanes almost every day. Such \ndevelopments have the effect of turning back the \nprogress made with respect to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Therefore, I would like to invite \nthe international community to set up mechanisms in \nAfrica and elsewhere in the developing world that can \nassist us in managing disasters. \n My country also attaches importance to the issue \nof climate change. Climate change has become an \nextremely difficult issue in Africa, where crops are \ndestroyed because there is either too much rain or too \nlittle rain, too much wind or too much sunshine. All \nthese possibilities are due to climate change. Therefore, \nI encourage the international community to come up \nwith mechanisms to manage climate change. I know \nthat countries like Malawi have not contributed to the \n  \n \n11-51670 34 \n \nincidence of climate change. Nevertheless, we feel we \ndo have a collective responsibility to make sure that \nthe issue of climate change is addressed. I hope that the \nupcoming seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, scheduled to take place in South Africa, will \naddress this particular problem.  \n The third area to which my country attaches \nimportance is the issue of peace and security. As we are \nall aware, no matter how much development we \nachieve, it will be meaningless if there is no peace and \nsecurity in our countries. Unfortunately, in our \ncountries, especially in Africa, we now face a lot of \nchallenges. There are movements of people who are \nbent upon bringing about unconstitutional changes of \nGovernment, thereby causing instability.  \n In the case of Malawi, we are committed to \nmaintaining peace and security. We are also committed \nto democracy and good governance. In this regard, \nMalawi has, for example, instituted a number of \nbodies, such as the Malawi Human Rights \nCommission, an ombudsman, an anti-corruption bureau \nand the Department of the Auditor General. All these \ninstitutions are institutions of good governance aimed \nat improving the governance in our part of Africa, and \ncertainly in Malawi.  \n Another issue that is of importance to Malawi in \nparticular and to Africa in general is the issue of self-\ndetermination. We still have over 2 million people in \ndifferent parts of the world living under colonial \ndomination. I want to urge the international community \nto make sure that by the end of the Third International \nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism \u2014 from \n2011 to 2021 \u2014 all the territories under colonial \ndomination will be free and independent. I think that \nself-governance is a very important concept. The self-\ndetermination of colonized peoples is enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations.  \n Of course, there is another element of self-\ndetermination which the United Nations obviously has \nto address, namely, that of self-determination outside \nthe colonial context. It is an extremely complicated \nproblem that needs to be addressed and studied. First \nof all, what does self-determination mean within the \ncontext of non-colonial States? What are peoples \nwithin the context of non-colonial States? It is an issue \nthat obviously we must address because it is an \nimportant one. \n Finally, my Government attaches great \nimportance to the role of the Security Council. There is \nno question that the Council has played an extremely \nimportant role since the creation of the United Nations \nin 1945. However, I think it is obvious to everybody \nthat the structure created in 1945 is no longer \napplicable to the present situation. We need therefore \nto make sure that the Security Council is democratized. \nWe need to make sure that majority of countries, \nespecially those most affected by the Security Council, \nlike Malawi and others in Africa, are given a role to \nplay in the Council. I therefore would like to endorse \nAfrica\u2019s common position, known as the Ezulwini \nConsensus, that two permanent member seats and five \nnon-permanent seats in the Security Council should be \ngiven to Africa."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to extend \ncongratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser on his appointment to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsixth regular session. As two small countries, Qatar and \nGrenada share much in common. Accordingly, we look \nforward to his leadership and stand ready to support \nhim for the good of all the members of the General \nAssembly and the United Nations itself. We welcome \n \n \n9 11-51197 \n \nhis theme on mediation because we believe that when \nmediation is properly applied it can minimize \nconfrontation in the world. I also commend the \noutgoing President, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his \nstewardship and dedication during the past year. \nGrenada congratulates Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \nelection to a second term as Secretary-General and \nwishes him continued success. \n Now in its thirty-seventh year of independence \nand membership of the United Nations, Grenada \nrenews its commitment to the principles of the United \nNations Charter, believing that universal adherence to \nthose principles provides guidance to the United \nNations to act on what may seem intractable, for the \nUnited Nations is intended to lead, perhaps more so in \ndifficult times.  \n Grenada supports the pursuit of international \npeace and security. We believe firmly in the rule of \nlaw, the promotion of democracy and respect for \nhuman rights. We also support the fight against \nterrorism, as well as the campaign against the illicit \ndrug trade. All these pose serious threats to the security \nof our changing world. My Government reiterates its \ncommitment to the United Nations Charter. In support \nof the role of the United Nations, this year the \nGovernment of Grenada has signed three global \nconventions, including the Convention on Cluster \nMunitions, helping to bring about disarmament. \n We are all obliged to work selflessly to preserve \nour planet for future generations. The avoidance of \nnuclear confrontation is one sure way. We therefore \ncongratulate all Governments that have expended much \ntime and effort on nuclear non-proliferation.  \n Since we met a year ago, the world and the \nUnited Nations itself have faced many challenges \u2014 \neconomic, social and political \u2014 all of which \nundermine stability and people\u2019s survival. The \neconomic crisis continues to weigh heavily on \nGrenada. Our population is experiencing high food and \nfuel prices, national revenues have decreased, and debt \ncontinues to be high. The green shoots of recovery that \nothers have experienced have not reached us. For us, \nthe economic crisis of 2008 still rages and we must \nfind a way out of it. Social and political strife remain, \nif not in Grenada, in other parts of the world. These \ndemonstrate that the search for freedom and justice is \nfar from over.  \n Human suffering and instability anywhere in the \nworld hurt us all, even in tiny Grenada, where \nunemployment in major capitals affects our tourism \nand even our remittances from abroad. The major \nchallenge facing Grenada as a small island developing \nState is how to reduce our weaknesses, how to increase \nour resilience, and how to pursue development for \npeople today and for their children tomorrow.  \n How are we to respond? We must attempt to \nachieve growth with equity, especially for women and \nyouth, and to support general improvements towards \npeople\u2019s advancement \u2014 that is, create stable \nenvironments and opportunities for our people to \nthrive \u2014 and we must do so while contributing to a \njust, peaceful and democratic global framework. We \nbelieve that whatever the challenge, our common \npolitical will for fairness and justice must remain our \noverarching guiding principles in matters economic, \nsocial and political. \n Grenada\u2019s main response so far has been to \nstrengthen our democratic processes and to advance the \nCaribbean regional integration movement. At the \nnational level, we promote social inclusion in the \ngovernance of the country that engages civil society, \nthe media and the people as a whole. We have \ninstituted consultations and participation in major \npolicy and legislative matters, including the revision of \nold laws and the making of new ones. At the regional \nlevel, we are working with the Organization of Eastern \nCaribbean States and the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM), two groupings that constitute the \nunbreakable link with our national undertakings and \nhow we engage internationally. \n Grenada\u2019s efforts to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment can be helped by both the December 2011 \nDurban Climate Change Conference and the June 2012 \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20). Grenada appeals to all parties \nto negotiate seriously and to meet commitments at both \nof these Conferences. These global meetings must \nbring added value to the ongoing efforts of Grenada \nand other developing countries, especially small States. \nDurban 2011 and Rio+20 must surely deliver \nmeaningful and attainable outcomes, including \nfulfilling old obligations and delivering on new ones, \nespecially on climate financing and the broader \nfinancing for development.  \n  \n \n11-51197 10 \n \n Developed countries must meet their \ncommitments to poorer nations. At the sixteenth \nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \nCanc\u00fan last year we made some progress on climate \nchange and we must build on that. We welcome the \nestablishment of the Transitional Committee of the \nGreen Climate Fund and hope to see it capitalized and \nfully launched in Durban. We are deeply disappointed \nthat some countries are blocking the mandated review \nof 1.5 degrees Celsius as the potential global average \nwarming limit. We call on those States to withdraw \ntheir objections and support the movement to a safe \nthreshold for islands and for the world. We are \nconvinced that an adequate global response to climate \nchange must remain at the top of the global agenda. A \nlegally binding outcome must be part of the outcome of \nclimate negotiations. \n I call on partners to hasten the disbursement of \nfast-start funds, especially to small island States. These \ndisbursements must be consistent with the scale of the \ndamage already done and the continuing threats that we \nface from environmental degradation. We express \nsolidarity with our Pacific sisters and brothers, who are \ndaily losing territory to sea-level rise, perhaps faster \nthan we are in the Caribbean. They have my pledge \nthat we will continue to support them. \n Naturally, we are taking responsibility for \nourselves. This year we are launching a sustainable \nenergy programme for 24 small island developing \nStates. The Small Island Developing States Sustainable \nEnergy Initiative (SIDS DOCK) will provide the \nfoundation for low carbon economic growth and \nadaptation to climate change. It will facilitate energy \nefficiency and provide renewable energy to 24 small \nisland developing States. On behalf of the Alliance of \nSmall Island States I thank the Government and people \nof Denmark for making the first contribution of an \ninitial US$ 14.5 million to SIDS DOCK. We also thank \nour partners the World Bank and the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme for facilitating the \nprogramme. We invite the international community to \njoin Denmark in financing this effort.  \n In a similar vein to our climate change efforts, we \nlook to the Rio+20 meeting to advance our path to \nsustainability. One of the key outcomes for Grenada \nand other SIDS must be the development of a green \neconomy, one that combines investments, jobs and \nlivelihoods with environmental resources; and a blue \neconomy, one that takes into account coastal- and \nocean-based income generation. For indeed, peoples\u2019 \nlivelihoods are largely based on environmental \nresources and services, including agriculture, \nagro-industries, forestry, mining and tourism. The \nRio+20 meeting can and must be a turning point for \npolitical commitment and financing for development. \n We know that the United Nations is capable of \nleadership. However, it can be more effective if it \nanticipates and responds to twenty-first century \nchallenges. That includes recognizing the fact that \ndozens of mature States, many in the developing world, \nare ready and able to take responsibility for the \nmanagement of the global agenda. The United Nations \nmust be reformed. How else will it support its growing \nagenda? How else can it manage this new global \nagenda for global sustainability, peace and \npeacekeeping and disaster response within a \ndemocratic multilateral system that is constantly \nevolving? What worked for 65 years must be reshaped \nfor today. That is why we call for reform of the \nSecurity Council to make it more representative and \ninclusive. Failure to do this will deny that body the \npolitical legitimacy it needs to maintain and indeed \nenhance its leadership role in the world and to make \nthe best decisions. Grenada joins with other member \nStates in the Caribbean Community and calls for \nexpansion of the Security Council in both its \npermanent and non-permanent categories and more \nopenness in its working methods. We call for a \nSecurity Council seat for small island States within a \nreasonable time frame and we also call for stronger and \nmore enhanced United Nations-CARICOM relations to \nbenefit the people of our Caribbean region. \n Grenada welcomes the formation and launch of \nthe United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women, which is aimed at promoting \nthe rights of women and girls and equality between the \nsexes. That is an early success of United Nations \nreform. \n Grenada is firmly committed to the principle of \nself-determination. On 14 July Grenada joined with \nother Member States in welcoming the Republic of \nSouth Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United \nNations. We salute the efforts of its people to usher in \npeace at home and within the region. \n I turn now to the seemingly intractable problem \nof moving Palestine from a State-in-waiting to an \n \n \n11 11-51197 \n \ninternationally recognized State. This cannot be \nseparated from the international clamour for \ndemocratic rights now led by the Arab Spring. The just \naspirations of the people of Palestine must be \naddressed, and Palestine must not be left behind in the \nhistorical sweep towards open and sustainable \ndemocracies. Equally, the Arab Spring should also be \nthe occasion for the renewal of a commitment to \nIsrael\u2019s security. Peace depends on viable democracies \nand sustained security. That is why Grenada is \ndisappointed that the Palestinians and Israelis have not \nconcluded talks over their long-standing dispute. We \nurge a return to these talks and look forward to the \npeaceful coexistence of these two States. \n It is quite obvious that the world continues to \nexperience the wrath of nature. We grieve at the waste \nof human life and the environmental destruction caused \nby disasters worldwide. We express our solidarity to \nMember States that have experienced floods, \nearthquakes, tsunamis and droughts in the past months. \nGrenada calls for a strong global response especially \nfor the humanitarian crisis now unfolding in the Horn \nof Africa. \n Grenada welcomes the new President of the sister \nCARICOM State of Haiti and wishes him and his team \nsuccess as they rebuild Haiti after the devastation of \nthe earthquake. While we thank all those who have \nhelped, much still remains to be done. We call on all \nwho have pledged to help Haiti to deliver on their \npledges and support the efforts of the Haitian people. \nTurning now to another Caribbean concern, Grenada \nagain urges the United States of America to completely \nlift the harsh economic embargo against the people of \nCuba. All but a handful of the United Nations \nmembership have consistently voted for the removal of \nthat embargo. \n We acknowledge that responding to the complex \nand interconnected issues on the United Nations \nagenda is a major task, even for the United Nations. \nNevertheless, responding must be at the top of the \nUnited Nations agenda. We maintain support for \nsustainable development, action on climate change, and \nsupport for justice and peace. Grenada commends the \nSecretary-General for organizing a number of high-\nlevel meetings on important topics. We are moved to \nsingle out the High-level Meeting on non-communicable \ndiseases. This scourge is negatively affecting not just \ndeveloping countries but many developed countries as \nwell. The proliferation of non-communicable diseases \nposes a very serious challenge to small island States \nlike Grenada because of their effects on the labour \nforce and demands on the shrinking finances of the \ncountry. We therefore welcome the outcome of the \nHigh-level Meeting and we pledge to implement its \nrecommendations. \n Finally, last year, building on the conclusion that \nthe United Nations is a real force for good in the world, \nI challenged the Organization to harness its strength to \nbetter achieve that purpose. This year, drawing on the \nmessage of youth to make the world a better place, I \nrepeat that call. It is my hope that, under the \nstewardship of the President, the General Assembly \u2014 \nand the United Nations as a whole \u2014 will continue to \nbe the main global force for the good of humanity. \nGrenada will do its part to advance this singular and \ninspiring goal."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, allow me to convey my sincere congratulations \nto the President on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I wish him \nevery success in his endeavours and assure him of the \nRomanian delegation\u2019s full support. \n Clearly, the theme chosen for this year\u2019s general \ndebate, \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes by peaceful means\u201d, is both wise and topical. \nRomania has a strong interest in the topic, given our \nlong tradition of mediation, as well as the number of \nunresolved conflicts in our region. Some conflicts have \npersisted for years and even decades and remain \nunresolved. Other conflicts have erupted suddenly, \nscotching the hopes for a brighter future and for the \ndevelopment of entire regions.  \n In the current security environment, mediation \nand conflict prevention instruments are highly \nimportant, yet under-utilized. A strengthened legal \nfoundation for mediation and strengthened mediation \nactivities of the United Nations and regional and \nsubregional organizations are necessary, as well as the \nincreased involvement of Member States in mediation \nefforts. \n We must continue at all times to be guided by the \nfact that mediation for peace and conflict-prevention at \nan early stage are much more beneficial than crisis \nmanagement and peacekeeping. To that end, we urge \nthe reporting and periodic evaluation of any and all \nconflict situations, anywhere in the world and without \n  \n \n11-51681 14 \n \nregard to context, by the Security Council and by all \nUnited Nations Member States. \n The protracted conflicts in Eastern Europe \ncontinue to require our undivided attention. We \nreiterate the importance of the international \ncommunity\u2019s continued involvement with them with a \nview to achieving peaceful solutions within the \nexisting regulatory frameworks. We continue to attach \ngreat importance to dialogue between the parties in \norder to achieve mutually acceptable solutions based \non respect for the sovereignty, independence and \nterritorial integrity of States within their internationally \nrecognized borders. \n In that context, we welcome the opening of \ndialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, facilitated by \nthe European Union (EU) following the resolution \nadopted in 2010 by the General Assembly (resolution \n64/298), and reiterate the central role of the United \nNations and the framework of Security Council \nresolution 1244 (1999). Recent problems have yet to be \novercome through cooperation, although the dialogue \nremains on track. \n We support the Geneva talks co-chaired by the \nUnited Nations, the EU and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe on the situation in \nAbkhazia and South Ossetia. Progress on the \nhumanitarian situation should not be held hostage to \npolitical setbacks, and urgent solutions are thus \nnecessary to address that situation. \n With regard to Afghanistan, we are witnessing \nprogress in the Afghan authorities\u2019 gradual takeover of \nresponsibility in the fields of security, reconstruction \nand socio-economic development. We welcome the \nsteps taken by the Afghan Administration for national \nreconciliation. We trust that a rigid framework with \nfixed time lines for the transition period is unnecessary. \nInstead, the transition process should be tailored \naccording to the particular realities and conditions \nrequired for the normal functioning of Afghan society. \n Romania considers that progress in Afghanistan \nalso depends on the efforts of the authorities in Kabul \nand the continued commitment of the international \ncommunity. In that context, we welcome the role and \nefforts of the United Nations, other international \norganizations and Member States and reaffirm \nRomania\u2019s commitment to building democratic \ninstitutions in Afghanistan. \n I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the valiant \nwomen and men who serve the cause of peace \nworldwide. Many of them, including Romanians, have \nlost their lives or were wounded on mission. We extend \nour deepest gratitude and respect for their sacrifice.  \n Recently, important statements were issued on the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. Romania favours a \nsustainable peace in the Middle East, and our country \nstrongly supports the principle of two States \u2014 Israel \nand Palestine \u2014 living together, side by side, in peace \nand security. The only viable solution that could be \neffectively applied to that case and form the basis of a \nglobal and sustainable peace would be through direct \nnegotiations. Romania is chairing the Fourth \nCommittee during this session, and we are ready to \nencourage, from that position as well, all diplomatic \nefforts aiming at achieving progress in the Israeli-\nPalestinian peace process. \n This year\u2019s General Assembly session is taking \nplace under the powerful image of the tremendous \npolitical transformations in North Africa and the \nMiddle East. Romania warmly welcomes those \ntransformations. What has become known by now as \nthe Arab Spring recalls in our minds and hearts the \nevents that took place more than 20 years ago in our \npart of the world. Twenty years later, we are proud of \nour accomplishments on the path of democracy-\nbuilding. Yet we know, first hand, that the journey is \ndifficult and sometimes daunting, with many \nchallenges lying ahead, not the least among them is the \nfact that the political forces in those countries must \nremain focused on their goals of freedom, democracy \nand justice that inspired them at the very beginning. \n Therefore, one of Romania\u2019s priorities is to assist \nthe countries in transition in North Africa and the \nMiddle East in their democratic quest. Romania is \nalready supporting democratization in its proximate \nregions and beyond. Currently, most of our \ndevelopment assistance funds are dedicated to building \ndemocratic institutions, consolidating the rule of law \nand protecting and promoting human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. \n In July in Bucharest we convened an international \nworkshop on electoral and political matters pertaining \nto democratic transition. The event was organized in \npartnership with the United Nations Development \n \n \n15 11-51681 \n \nProgramme, the Electoral Assistance Division of the \nUnited Nations Secretariat in New York and the \nPermanent Electoral Authority of Romania. The \nworkshop was attended by over 40 participants from \nEgypt and Tunisia who represented public institutions \ninvolved in organizing elections, the media, civil \nsociety and academic circles and Romanian and \ninternational experts. The seminar focused on sharing \nexperiences with first electoral cycles in post-\nauthoritarian regimes as foundational moments for new \ndemocratic societies through credible, transparent and \nfree elections.  \n Romania believes that the political \ntransformations occurring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and \nelsewhere should be endorsed and supported by the \nUnited Nations with all available resources. It is our \ncollective responsibility to see to it that the proper \nconditions for human dignity and prosperity are set up \nin all our countries and that progress in the quest for \nfundamental freedoms and equal rights for all human \nbeings is supported. That is part of Romania\u2019s mandate \nas a newly elected member in the Human Rights \nCouncil, a mandate we intend to implement in a \nconstructive, balanced and comprehensive manner. \n Although human rights are fundamental rights, \nthe current situation in the world is far from \nsatisfactory. Human rights and democracy are universal \nvalues that require our constant attention and \nprotection against any repressive actions. In that \nrespect, the legitimate and peaceful demands by the \npeople of North Africa and Middle East for respect for \ntheir human rights and liberty are emblematic. \n We reaffirm our will to act in cooperation with \npartners to achieve a global and coherent approach \ntowards the risks and threats to international peace and \nsecurity, particularly those arising from the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nconventional weapons. The best way to reduce the risks \nof the use of nuclear arms and materials, in particular \nby non-State actors, is to irreversibly eliminate nuclear \narsenals and apply a strict framework for \nnon-proliferation. We support and call on all States to \nconsider undertaking long-term responsible \ninvolvement in this area and to focus on global security \ninterests above all. \n We are all familiar with the current multilateral \nframework that governs non-proliferation, disarmament \nand arms control. All treaties and conventions have \nproved their usefulness so far. Yet, more is needed so \nas to increase the effectively of their implementation \nand the degree to which their provisions are observed. \nWe stand ready to work with others to achieve this key \nobjective for the global security architecture. \n Romania reiterates its commitment to continuing \nits active engagement in the preparatory process for the \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment. Pursuing an open and transparent \ndialogue on the objectives and themes of the \nConference during the current session is one of the \nmain steps that will help guide our actions. \n The Conference will be a unique occasion for the \ninternational community to place humanity on a path \ntowards sustainable development and the eradication of \npoverty, and, in that context, to establish a clear vision \nof the green economy. Economic growth and the need \nto promote transition towards a green economy must be \nconsidered opportunities to make more with less, \naiming for a higher standard of living and social \nequality for all. \n Climate change should continue to be a \nmobilizing factor despite the obvious obstacles. We \nshould not let differences and the high complexity of \ninterests undermine our determination. The \nnegotiations in Durban, based on the decisions of \nCanc\u00fan and the Copenhagen Accord, should pave the \nway towards a swift adoption of a post-Kyoto global \nregime. \n A clear and present challenge is that, while we \nare trying to set the world on a path of sustainable and \nequitable growth, we have to cope with one of the most \nsevere economic and financial crises of modern times. \nThe crisis, which still wreaks havoc on international \naffairs, has revealed the vulnerabilities of our financial \nand economic systems, both national and international. \nIt has become evident that the world financial system is \nnot adapted to the realities of global competition. \nIndeed, the entire system of economic and financial \ngovernance needs to be revised, and budgets, including \nthat of the United Nations, need to be kept under strict \ncontrol. \n In times of crisis, options are limited. We can \ndwell in endless debates on \u201cwhat should have been \ndone\u201d or \u201cwhat might have been\u201d. But this is not the \ntime for such debates; rather, it is the time to act. As \nthe President of the European Council said the other \nday in the Hall, \u201cWe act, supporting the forces of hope \n  \n \n11-51681 16 \n \nand fighting the causes of worry\u201d (See ). \nWe stand by this option. Reforms are needed that lead \nto the comprehensive observance of good governance \nprinciples, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as \nwell as the wise use of available resources. That is the \nonly option. A country without equal and dignified \ncitizens can never be rich."

        "file_text": "The Democratic Republic of Sao \nTome and Principe joins other speakers at this global \nforum in congratulating the President on his election to \nlead the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \nHis election is the acknowledgment by Member States \nof the more than 30 years\u2019 experience that he and his \ncountry, Qatar, have given in service of promoting \ninternational peace and security, sustainable \ndevelopment and dynamic, multidimensional \ncooperation among developing countries, as well as in \ncontinuing the search for solutions to the challenges \nfacing multilateral diplomacy today. \n We also congratulate the President on the \nsignificance of the theme of this session, \u201cThe role of \nmediation in conflict resolution through peaceful \nmeans\u201d, whose relevance and timeliness merit the \nattention of all of us here and can help ensure that the \noutcome of our collective discussions will support the \nUnited Nations in its effective guidance of global \ndemocratic governance and in implementing coherent \nand consistent mechanisms aimed at achieving lasting \npeace and a more secure world. \n We further congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \nreappointment to the post of Secretary-General, and \nthank him for the effort and skill with which he has \nguided the Organization, whose challenges and \nresponsibilities seem more pressing than ever in the \ncurrent international context. We would also like to pay \ntribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Joseph Deiss of \nSwitzerland, who carried out his duties with zeal and \ndedication during the past year. \n The theme of this session of the Assembly gives \nus an opportunity to reflect deeply together on the \nimpact of international mediation on the resolution of \nconflicts in various regions of our planet. We would \nlike to bring to this reflection a discussion of the \ncentral role that the United Nations should play in \nmediating such conflicts. This exercise should help us \nformulate concrete proposals for strengthening the \ncapabilities of our Organization in this area. \n Mediation as a method of resolving conflicts \nbetween States began to be used in 1907 in the form of \ngood offices and mediation on the basis of The Hague \nConvention for the peaceful regulation of international \nconflicts. United Nations reports on peacekeeping \noperations should therefore remind us that the \nrestoration of peace focuses on ongoing conflicts and \nstrives to de-escalate them through diplomacy and \nmediation. The widespread use of international \nmediation to resolve crises as a fundamental technique \nof peaceful conflict resolution has not always matched \nour expectations or produced the expected results. \n It is for that reason that Sao Tome and Principe \nbelieves that rather than settling for its role in \npeacekeeping, international mediation must evolve to \nbecome a fundamental factor in peacebuilding. In that \nregard, the United Nations should be responsible for \ndealing with what appears today to be a trend towards \nthe professionalization of international mediation, \nwhich relegates to the background the legal \ninstruments ratified by specialized institutions to deal \nwith a given conflict. Defining the legal status of the \nmediator and the methodology of mediation, as well as \ngreater involvement by diplomats and experts with \nexperience in international law, seems to us to be \nnecessary and important steps that the United Nations \nshould take in the future. \n The State of Sao Tome and Principe has followed \nwith concern the growing international climate of \ntension, characterized by proliferating claims in \nvarious regions, some of them violent and destructive. \nOur concern is all the more worrisome given our \ndistinct feeling that in such circumstances the \nmechanisms available to the United Nations for dealing \nwith such matters effectively and accurately are pushed \ninto the background. We regret the absence of a \nresponsible partnership between the African Union and \nthe Security Council designed to resolve the crisis in \nLibya. \n It is therefore urgent that we strengthen the role \nof the United Nations by reforming the entire \nsystem \u2014 a process that should not drag on. This \n  \n \n11-51390 22 \n \nreform should include the Security Council and some \nof the specialized agencies of the United Nations, \naligning them with the aspirations and demands of the \nmodern world. \n On 9 July, Africa saw the birth of one more free \nand independent nation: the Republic of South Sudan. \nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \nwhich has already recognized the brotherly State of \nSouth Sudan, congratulates its people on this \nachievement and wishes its leaders every success in \nbuilding a peaceful and prosperous nation. Similarly, \nwe appeal to the entire international community to \nmake a joint effort to support the new authorities and \npolitical actors of that country in order to maintain the \nnational sovereignty of the new State and to promote a \nclimate of national unity and political stability. \n East Africa is facing a serious food crisis caused \nby phenomena that are beyond the control of men and \nby the political and military conflict still raging in \nparts of Somalia. It is incumbent upon us all to \ncontribute without delay to finding a lasting solution to \nthis serious situation. The Government of Sao Tome \nand Principe proclaims its readiness to participate in \nactivities contributing to the alleviation of the suffering \nof the people of that region. We join other Members of \nthe United Nations in appealing to the international \ncommunity to provide more financial resources to \nsupport efforts to normalize the situation in the region. \nIn the particular case of Somalia, we would appeal for \nan increase in official development assistance. \n The United Nations is still addressing the pending \nquestion of the Western Sahara and has adopted several \nresolutions aimed at settling the conflict between the \nKingdom of Morocco and the Frente Polisario. Sao \nTome and Principe would like to see the two parties sit \nat the negotiating table and urges the United Nations to \nproceed with the population census, in accordance with \nits own resolutions, with a view to completing this long \nprocess of negotiation. \n Democracy has the virtue of giving a voice to \npeople so they can choose their leaders through \npopular, free, direct and transparent elections by secret \nballots cast in voting booths. The uprisings that started \nin January in North Africa have expressed the \nsentiments and will of the people of Tunisia, Egypt and \nLibya to turn the page of their contemporary history. It \nis in this conviction that the Democratic Republic of \nSao Tome and Principe recognizes the new governing \nauthorities in these countries as legitimate \nrepresentatives of their peoples.  \n We welcome the presence of the National \nTransitional Council within the United Nations, and \nurge the authorities of that country to conduct an \ninclusive process of peaceful transition to ensure \npeace, stability and social progress in that part of \nAfrica. Furthermore, our country is of the view that \npolitical changes should take place not under violent \ncircumstances, but without any pressure or political \ninterference. \n The Middle East continues to be shaken by an \nunprecedented wave of conflicts within the borders of \nsome Middle Eastern countries as well as in the \nbroader region. The people of Syria, Yemen and \nBahrain have demanded reforms in State institutions. \nHowever, we see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \ncontinue. We reaffirm our support for the Palestinian \npeople\u2019s right to guide their destiny, and we advocate, \nin accordance with the relevant United Nations \nresolutions, for the existence of a Jewish State. We take \nthis opportunity to appeal to the Government of the \nUnited States of America and the European Union to \nexert their influence to persuade the Government of the \nState of Israel to stop building settlements in the \noccupied territories. \n The trade embargo imposed on Cuba decades ago \nis a major concern for our countries, and for Sao Tome \nand Principe in particular. We urge the lifting of the \nsanctions so that Cuba can participate on equal footing \nwith other States in the process of building an \ninternational society that is more balanced and fair. \n Global security is vital to the sustainable \ndevelopment of our countries. The threats emerging in \nthe world today \u2014 particularly transnational crime, \npiracy, trafficking and the sale of weapons and \ndrugs \u2014 are a real source of concern for Sao Tome and \nPrincipe, a country with extensive sea borders in the \nGulf of Guinea. These phenomena are threats that \ncannot be ignored and require greater interaction with \nthe Member States with which we share these extensive \nmaritime borders. They also require our commitment to \nconflict prevention, management and resolution \nmechanisms, based on efforts to fight organized crime \nand with a view to ensuring our collective security. \n In this connection, we highlight the fact that the \n32nd meeting of the United Nations Standing Advisory \nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, \n \n \n23 11-51390 \n \norganized by the United Nations Office for \nDisarmament Affairs through its Regional Centre for \nPeace and Disarmament in Africa in Lom\u00e9, was held in \nSao Tome and Principe in March. \n On behalf of the Government of the Democratic \nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe, I would like to \nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his timely \nand correct decision to give Africa its own central \nOffice, which we believe will contribute greatly to the \npromotion and development of actions to prevent, \nmanage and resolve conflicts in the region and will \nassist countries of the region in coping with possible \nthreats to their sovereignty. \n The profound changes wrought in the \ninternational political scene, resulting from structural \nchanges in the world economy, pose new challenges to \ncountries like Sao Tome and Principe. My country, a \nmicro-island State, advocates greater access to the \nvarious opportunities available at the international \nlevel, in particular the possibility of obtaining more \nofficial development assistance and facilities to attract \nforeign investment. \n It is our collective responsibility to take measures \nto address the harmful effects of climate change and \nensure the continuity of the clean development \nmechanism, particularly for the least developed \ncountries. We appreciate the political willingness of \nMember States to further pursue the building of the \nnecessary consensus to achieve significant and legally \nbinding results in Durban, South Africa, at the next \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, thus \nguaranteeing the second commitment period of the \nKyoto Protocol. \n However, climate change has caused imbalances \nin the microclimate of our country, with drastic \nconsequences for our domestic production, thereby \nthreatening the food security in Sao Tome and Principe. \nFrom this perspective, and in order to combat this \nscourge, civil society in Sao Tome has been advocating \nthe need to enhance the study of the causes and adverse \neffects of climate change in Sao Tome and Principe. To \nfulfil this goal, the authorities of my country would \nlike to continue to rely on the invaluable collaboration \nand availability expressed thus far by the international \ncommunity in general and the specialized entities of \nthe United Nations in particular. \n I cannot end this speech without addressing the \nsituation of the two straits.  \n Taking into account that has Taiwan not only \nenormous potential, but also a population of around \n23 million people, its participation in United Nations \nspecialized agencies, as has been the case since 2009 \nwith respect to the World Health Assembly, could make \na substantial contribution to the international \ncommunity. In this regard, we urge the relevant United \nNations bodies to seek ways and means to ensure the \nparticipation of Taiwan in some of the mechanisms and \nagencies of the United Nations system, in particular the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. \n The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \nPrincipe has just concluded the consolidation of its \ndemocratic process and transition of power through an \nelection by universal suffrage, which was direct and \nanonymous. The President-elect took office on \n3 September. Domestically, our Government is working \nto reduce poverty and promote economic growth and \ninstitutional reform, particularly in the area of justice, \nin order to strengthen the capacities of the country\u2019s \ndemocratic institutions and development. \n With regard to the Millennium Development \nGoals set by the United Nations for 2015, the \nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has \nmade significant progress, particularly in the areas of \neducation and health. We recognize, however, that \ngreater efforts should be made to attain the desired \nobjectives. In that regard, our State wishes to continue \nto benefit from the continued and multifaceted support \nof the international community. \n To conclude, I would like to reiterate the \nreadiness of the Government of the Democratic \nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe to participate in \nefforts to mobilize our collective will and our synergies \nin pursuit of the noble principles and objectives that \nunderpin the creation of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "I \nsincerely congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the post of \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I am convinced that his considerable \nexperience will contribute to the achievement of \nsignificant results on behalf of States Members of the \nUnited Nations and the entire Organization. \n This year, the great family of States Members of the \nUnited Nations was enriched by a new 193rd Member. On \nbehalf of Ukraine, I would like to express our support \nfor the Government and people of South Sudan in the \nprocess of State-building, and to assure them of \nUkraine\u2019s readiness to develop equal and mutually \nbeneficial cooperation with a new member of the \ninternational community. \n This is a special session given the number of high-\nlevel meetings devoted to issues of a global scale \u2014 \nnuclear safety and security, the prevention of \nnon-communicable diseases, desertification and land \ndegradation, racism and discrimination. \n During this session, the delegation of Ukraine has \nactively participated in discussions on the issues that \nare most topical for our State \u2014 nuclear security and \ndisease control. With regard to the theme of the general \ndebate, \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes\u201d, I note that the issue of preventing armed \nconflict, and the loss of human lives and the suffering \ntriggered by them, was one of the cornerstones of \nUkraine\u2019s first membership, as an independent State, of \nthe Security Council in 2000-2001. \n Preventive diplomacy and mediation at the \nregional and international levels, from the frozen \nconflicts in the post-Soviet space to a peaceful \nsettlement in the Middle East and the restoration of \nstability in North Africa, remain an integral part of \nUkraine\u2019s foreign policy. We pursue that policy in the \nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Commission, and will \ncontinue to do so during Ukraine\u2019s presidency of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in \n2013. \n Regrettably, conflict prevention efforts are often \nnot effective enough, and conflict settlement takes too \nlong. Our main duty in such cases is to save lives and \nto alleviate the fate of civilians who find themselves in \ndanger. Ukraine will always provide help to those who \nsuffer. In addition to humanitarian efforts, we are ready \nto support all constructive international peace \ninitiatives and preventive measures. \n We believe that, in armed confrontations, top \npriority must be given to respect for human rights, first \nof all by ensuring the safety of civilians. Guided by \nthis principle, Ukraine was among the first to carry out \na humanitarian mission in Libya at the beginning of \nthis year. The Ukrainian amphibious landing ship \nKonstantin Olshansky was used to evacuate almost \n200 citizens of 20 nationalities, more than half of them \nwomen and children, from the conflict zone. \n Ukraine has just celebrated the twentieth \nanniversary of its independence. Today, we are \nassessing the road we have travelled and rethinking \nsome important moments in our modern history in \norder to find effective solutions to the issues that have \nremained unresolved for many years. It is precisely for \nthat purpose that I have initiated sweeping reforms in \nthe country, aimed at social and economic \ntransformations and at further strengthening the \ndemocratic system and the rule of law in Ukraine.  \n The foundations of all reform processes in \nUkraine are the fundamental democratic values that \nUkrainians share with other Europeans. That is why the \nguiding principles we have determined for the \nmodernization of the country are directly related to the \nambitious objectives contained in the future \nAssociation Agreement between Ukraine and the \nEuropean Union. \n The twentieth anniversary of our independence is \nonly an instant in historical terms, yet the roots of our \nstatehood can be traced back thousands of years. Since \nancient times, Ukraine has been developing a European \nspirit and culture, while cherishing the traditions of \ntolerance and inter-ethnic and intercultural harmony in \n \n \n5 11-50702 \n \nour society. We believe that straightforward and frank \ndialogue based on universal values is the only way to \nfind a common language in each country and in \ninternational relations alike. \n Ukraine\u2019s position on the need to uphold human \nrights at all times and everywhere as the highest value \nhas always been crystal clear. Examples of that \ncommitment are seen in Ukraine\u2019s activities during its \ntwo terms of membership in the Human Rights Council \nfrom June 2006 to June 2011. We will not lessen our \nattention to this subject and are planning to rejoin the \nCouncil in 2018. \n As Chair of the Committee of Ministers of the \nCouncil of Europe from May to November this year, \nUkraine is focused on the issues of children\u2019s rights, \nthe development of local self-governance and the rule \nof law. We are convinced that the rule of law and \nrespect for human rights, as the bases for building a \nsociety, are needed to counter many contemporary \nthreats, including the complex challenges of terrorism. \n Recently, the world shuddered from the attack on \nthe United Nations building in Nigeria, which offered \nyet further proof that the ugly face of terrorism is \nbecoming more repulsive and brazen. The blow was \nstruck directly against our Organization, which is of \nparticular concern and requires increased security for \nUnited Nations premises. \n As one of the State initiators of the Convention \non the Safety of United Nations and Associated \nPersonnel, and as a party to all universal anti-terrorist \nconventions currently in force, Ukraine resolutely \ncondemns any manifestations of terrorism. We believe \nthat all terrorist acts, regardless of who commits them \nand where or why they are committed, violate a \nfundamental human right \u2014 the right to life \u2014 and \ntherefore constitute a crime against humanity. I pay \ntribute to the memory of those killed 10 years ago, on \n11 September 2001, as well as to all other victims of \nterrorist attacks. \n I am sincerely proud of the significant \ncontribution of Ukraine to the peaceful coexistence of \nhumankind. I refer not only to our voluntarily \nabandoning nuclear arms and large stockpiles of highly \nenriched uranium. The awareness of the global scale of \nthe effects of the Chernobyl disaster was the impetus \nfor my initiative to convene the Kyiv Summit on the \nSafe and Innovative Use of Nuclear Energy in April. \nThe Summit enabled us to enhance international \ncooperation in strengthening nuclear safety and in \nresponding adequately to accidents and emergencies. I \nsincerely thank all the participants in the Kyiv Summit \nand all of the donor countries that announced their \ncontributions to Chernobyl projects. \n We also welcome the holding of the high-level \nmeeting on nuclear safety and security, scheduled for \ntomorrow. We are committed to jointly working further \non this issue. Our country has unique experience in the \nrehabilitation of the area and the population victimized \nby the Chernobyl disaster. We are ready to share this \nexperience. Ukraine consistently supports efforts to \nensure gradual and irreversible nuclear disarmament \nfor the purpose of completely eliminating nuclear \nweapons from the world. We continue to insist that \nsecurity assurances for non-nuclear and non-aligned \nStates should be enshrined in a legally binding \ninternational instrument. I urge the leaders of other \nStates to consciously follow the example of Ukraine \nand its practical actions to promote disarmament and \nnon-proliferation. \n Ukraine is actively participating in United \nNations efforts to maintain international peace and \nsecurity. Throughout its 20 years of independence, over \n34,000 Ukraine\u2019s soldiers and police have taken part in \npeacekeeping missions in more than 20 operations \nunder the United Nations mandate. Ukraine is a \ndedicated supporter of United Nations peacekeeping \nreform, the goal of which is to strengthen the \nOrganization\u2019s capacity and eliminate existing \nshortcomings. Utmost attention should be paid to \nensuring the mobility of aviation resources in United \nNations peacekeeping, as well as to enhancing legal \nprotection for Blue Helmets. We are grateful to \nMember States for their support of Ukraine\u2019s initiatives \nin this area, and we hope for effective joint work to be \nundertaken in this direction. \n One year ago, we held a High-level Plenary \nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals. \nUkraine is committed to its obligations in achieving \nnational development goals. Among our main priorities \nare poverty reduction, ensuring quality education, \nenvironmental protection, improving health and \nreducing child mortality, curbing the spread of \nHIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and ensuring gender \nequality.  \n Working on today\u2019s immediate tasks, we believe \nit is necessary to pay greater attention to the \n  \n \n11-50702 6 \n \nincreasingly acute issue of climate change and \nenvironmental protection. We endorse the idea of \ncreating an effective international mechanism for the \nenvironmental protection of Earth as our common \nplanet \u2014 a global environmental organization with \nuniversal membership functioning on a permanent \nbasis. We also call upon Member States to study the \nidea of developing a new universal instrument that \ncould serve as a so-called environmental constitution, \ngive all countries clear guidelines from the cultural \nperspective, and identify compulsory principles for the \nsustainable development of the global green economy \nand the environmental safety of the planet. \n We consider it necessary to work on improving \nglobal energy security. We encourage the development, \nunder United Nations coordination, of an effective \nmultilateral cooperation mechanism aimed at achieving \ndevelopment goals in the energy field. \n In overcoming the impact of the global economic \ncrisis, we must avoid new challenges to the financial \nsector that affect trade and investment. It is our belief \nthat economic and social development should be \nfacilitated by the further liberalization of trade. \n In recent years, we have come to see how \nvulnerable any one nation can be to various security \nthreats and natural or manmade disasters. All these \nexamples have shown us the need for effective \ninternational mechanisms for combating such \nphenomena. It is high time that the United Nations and \nits specialized agencies seriously strengthened their \nrole in coordinating international efforts aimed at \npreventing, responding to and overcoming the impacts \nof catastrophes and severe humanitarian crises. We \nlook forward to strengthening the specialized United \nNations agencies and improving their effectiveness. \nUkraine stands ready to continue its active involvement \nin the practical humanitarian efforts of the World Food \nProgramme. A few days ago, Ukraine decided to \nprovide, through the United Nations, humanitarian \nassistance in the form of wheat for the purpose of \ncombating hunger in the Horn of Africa. \n Ukraine supports the greater involvement of the \nGeneral Assembly in international life and \nstrengthening its voice in addressing a wide range of \nglobal issues. The modern world is presenting the \nUnited Nations with new, complex and increasingly \ndifficult issues. We will not be able to improve the \neffectiveness of our joint work, however, without \ncomprehensive reform of the Organization and its \nprincipal bodies, including the Security Council.  \n Ukraine is open to discussing all progressive \nconcepts of reform that can bring Member States to the \nbroadest possible agreement. The consideration of the \ninterests of every regional group is an indispensable \ncomponent of the process of reforming the Council. \nUkraine believes that at least one additional \nnon-permanent seat of an expanded Security Council \nshould be given to the Group of Eastern European \nStates. \n I am confident that the sixty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly will strengthen the United Nations \nin the face of global challenges and threats, reliably \nguaranteed by our strong political commitment and a \nclear vision of our common goals. I believe in our \nshared success."

As a result, \nwe have achieved considerable progress in social \nadvancement and poverty reduction.   \n For the next five years, the Government has \nidentified immediate and medium-term targets to \naccelerate economic development in all aspects so as to \nbuild a strong basis for the implementation of the \nnational strategy to transform the country into an \nindustrialized and modernized nation and achieve the \nultimate goal for graduating from least developed \ncountry status by 2020. \n In this globalizing and integrated world, all \nnations big and small, rich and poor, have become \nmore interdependent than ever. None of us can survive \nin isolation from the international community. \nAlthough the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has in \nthe past recorded satisfactory achievements in its \nnational socio-economic development endeavour, the \ncountry will continue to confront daunting challenges. \nAs a small, least developed nation, the country has \nbeen vulnerable to external shocks. Therefore, it shares \nwith other countries the desire to reside in a peaceful \nand secured world.  \n That being said, all nations must continue to \nenhance development cooperation, to ensure tangible \nbenefits for their peoples based on mutual respect, \nsolidarity, understanding and assistance, and avoid the \nuse of threat, interference and force. Nevertheless, it is \nunfortunate that we have faced multiple challenges \nover the past year caused by regional conflicts, and \nspreading social unrest, coupled with financial and \neconomic crisis and devastating natural disasters, \nwhich have become more frequent. All this has posed \nsevere threats to global peace, stability, security and \ndevelopment cooperation.  \n Against this backdrop, these multiple challenges \nare not only obstructing developing countries, the least \ndeveloped in particular, in pursuing their national \ndevelopment efforts and achieving the international \ndevelopment goals, but are also further reversing \ndevelopment. \n In such circumstances, we believe that the United \nNations, as the only universal Organization, should \nfurther enhance its role in order to address the \nchallenges in a more timely and just manner in \nresponse to the common aspirations of all Member \nStates. Towards this end, we must accelerate the United \nNations reform process, which has been pending for \nyears, to achieve a more concrete outcome. It is more \ncritical than ever for all Member States to enhance our \ncooperation in a sincere and trustworthy manner, \nwithout taking advantage of one another, in the effort \nto reform the United Nations bodies and improve their \neffectiveness. \n Security and political stability remain critical to \nadvancing the socio-economic development of all \nregions. The United Nations should therefore play a \nmore critical role in maintaining international peace \nand security by effectively carrying out its duty to \naddress regional conflicts, especially with regard to the \nsituation in the Middle East, which has gone \nunresolved for decades. Against this backdrop, the \nUnited Nations should play a more effective \nfacilitating role in urging all parties concerned to find a \nsolution and realize the vision of two States, Israel and \nPalestine, living side by side in peace and security and \nwithin internationally recognized borders, as stipulated \nin the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. In \nthis regard, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nsupports Palestine\u2019s application on 23 September for \nfull membership in the United Nations. \n Another important concern remains the issue of \nthe economic, trade and financial embargo imposed on \nCuba for several decades, which has seriously affected \nthe Cuban people. We believe that it is now time for \nthat embargo to be lifted unconditionally. \n  \n \n11-51384 40 \n \n Peace and security in South-East Asia have \ncontributed to creating an environment conducive to \nthe socio-economic advancement of the member \ncountries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN). At present, ASEAN is continuing its efforts \nto accelerate community-building by 2015 based on \nthree pillars: the ASEAN Political-Security \nCommunity, the ASEAN Economic Community and \nthe ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. Indeed, we \nhave made steady progress in our common endeavour.  \n In its community-building efforts, ASEAN aims \nto implement free trade areas among its 10 member \ncountries, as well as between ASEAN and its dialogue \npartners. In the same vein, our organization has further \nstrengthened its external cooperation by maintaining \nASEAN centrality in all ASEAN-initiated frameworks, \nsuch as ASEAN+1, ASEAN+3, the ASEAN Regional \nForum, the ASEAN Defense Ministers\u2019 Meeting-Plus \nand the East Asia Summit. In addition, ASEAN has \nstarted to discuss its long-term vision and role beyond \nthe year 2015. All of this has contributed to \nmaintaining peace, stability and development \ncooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region and in the \nworld at large. \n The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is another \nimportant mechanism for facilitating international \ncooperation. Over the past 15 years, ASEM has \ndeveloped remarkably and become an important forum \nfor leaders to consider measures to respond to \nemerging regional and global challenges. In that \ncontext, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is \nhonoured that ASEAN member countries have \nentrusted it with hosting the ninth ASEM Summit, to \nbe held early in November 2012 in Vientiane, its \ncapital. The Lao Government has made the \npreparations for the Summit a top priority. In that \nregard, I take this opportunity to invite the leaders of \nASEM member countries to attend the Summit. It will \nprovide an excellent opportunity for leaders from the \ntwo regions to discuss important issues related to \npromoting peace and enhancing effective cooperation \namong the countries of Asia and Europe in this new \nera. \n Socio-economic development in a country that \nhas suffered the consequences and legacy of war has \nnever been easy. One of the main obstacles and \nhindrances to our efforts to advance socio-economic \ndevelopment is unexploded ordnance, which continues \nto have an extensive and serious negative impact on the \nlivelihoods of the Lao people, both directly and \nindirectly. The Lao Government has made every effort \nand mobilized financial means to clear the \ncontaminated areas, particularly agricultural and \ninhabitable lands across the country, as well as to raise \npublic awareness and help victims to reintegrate into \nsociety.  \n In discharging its duties as President of the First \nMeeting of States Parties to the Conference on Cluster \nMunitions, over the past year the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic has received invaluable support \nand assistance from the international community, \nincluding States parties and non-State parties, \ninternational organizations, in particular the United \nNations Development Programme, civil society \norganizations and international non-governmental \norganizations. All have contributed to the early \nimplementation of this humanitarian Convention.  \n On that note, on behalf of the Lao Government \nand people, as well as on my own behalf, I would like \nto express my most sincere appreciation to all countries \nand international organizations for their support and \nassistance. These were clearly reflected in the broad \nparticipation in the First Meeting of States Parties, \nwhich was hosted by the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic in November 2010. Furthermore, I would like \nto congratulate those countries that have ratified or \nacceded to the Convention. The number of States \nparties to the Convention has now increased to 63. I \nhope that other countries that are not yet States parties \nwill consider acceding to it in the near future. It is more crucial than ever that the international \ncommunity seize the opportunity to fulfil its obligation \nto promote and enhance cooperation as a means of \naddressing pressing challenges, which no country can \ndo on its own. Against that backdrop, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic reaffirms its consistent \ndetermination to work closely with the international \ncommunity, thereby helping to make this world a \npeaceful, equal and just place, free of fear and \ndeprivation. I am convinced that close cooperation and \nmutual assistance will enable us all to achieve our \ncommon goals."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating the President on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. Let me also express our sincere appreciation to \nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations, for the strong commitment and \ndedication with which he has been serving the United \nNations. We wish him further success in his second \nterm.  \n Nepal warmly welcomes the Republic of South \nSudan as the newest member of the United Nations. \n It is a distinct honour and privilege for me to \nbring to the General Assembly the voice of the \nvoiceless of the world. I have brought with me \ngreetings from the nearly 30 million toiling, but proud, \npeople of Nepal, who have recently liberated \nthemselves from an age-old feudal monarchy and \nautocracy. Nepal is the enchanting land of Mount \nEverest, the top of the world. It is the birthplace of \nGautam Buddha, the apostle of peace. It possesses an \nunbelievable variety of natural beauty and diversity. \n In recent years, a momentous transformation has \ntaken place in Nepal. After a long and persistent \nstruggle, the feudalistic and autocratic monarchy has \nbeen abolished. We have entered into a new historic era \nwith the creation of the new Federal Democratic \nRepublic of Nepal. Today, the new State apparatus \nstrives to take into account the multi-ethnic, \nmultilingual and multicultural diversity of the country. \nThe abolition of all discrimination and oppression on \nthe basis of class, gender, nationality, region and caste \nand the creation of an inclusive democratic system and \na just society are at the heart of all our decades-long \nstruggles. Thanks to the ultimate sacrifice of the \nthousands of martyrs of the historic people\u2019s war of \n1996 to 2006, the people\u2019s movement of 2006, the \nMadheshi movement and many other oppressed \npeople\u2019s movements, we have come this far to lay the \nfoundation of a new Nepal.  \n We must consolidate those historic gains and \ninstitutionalize them in order to establish sustainable \npeace, justice and prosperity for all. My Government is \nfully committed to doing that with the conclusion of \nthe peace process and the writing of a new constitution \nthrough the Constituent Assembly at the earliest. The \nconstitution will not only guarantee fundamental \ndemocratic norms and values, but it will also ensure \nthat our multiparty democracy is inclusive, \nparticipatory and life-changing for all, especially the \noppressed labouring masses and marginalized people. \nIt is rightly said that the highest measure of democracy \nis neither the extent of freedom nor the extent of \nequality; rather, it is the highest measure of \nparticipation. We want to institutionalize a genuinely \nparticipatory democracy for all, particularly those who \nare downtrodden. \n In that context, I would like to remind the \nAssembly of the poignant words expressed from this \nrostrum in 2008 by the Chairman of my party, the \nUnified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, and the \nthen Prime Minister, Comrade Prachanda, about the \nlandless peasants, the downtrodden women, the so-\ncalled untouchable dalits and the millions of exploited \nmasses of Nepal, who aspire to liberation from all \nforms of oppression and exploitation. \n Nepal\u2019s home-driven peace process and historic \ntransformation are unique and could be a good example \nfor drawing lessons. We believe that transformation has \nto be holistic in order to have a long-lasting impact at \nthe grass-roots level. Transformation in the political, \nsocial and economic fields has to be brought about \nholistically. It is attainable with dedication, dialogue \nand consensus-building among stakeholders. As in any \nother country, transitional pains and delays exist. \nHowever, we are united in our vision, and we intend to \ncomplete the transition process with the consensus and \ncooperation of all political parties and stakeholders. We \nare confident that, with international goodwill and \ncooperation, we will achieve it at the earliest. \n Nepal\u2019s foreign policy is based on the \nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, \n \n \n21 11-51360 \n \nnon-alignment and panchsheel and the promotion of \nregional cooperation through the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation. We would like \nto be a vibrant bridge between our two neighbours, \nIndia and China, and beyond. At a time when \nhumankind is so much in need of peace and when we \nall strive for it, we particularly appeal for the \ndevelopment of Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha, as \nthe fountain of world peace through effective \ninternational support and cooperation. The \nInternational Committee for the Development of \nLumbini needs to be reactivated at the earliest. \n I extend sincere thanks to the United Nations, \nespecially the United Nations Mission in Nepal, for \nproviding invaluable support and assistance throughout \nour peace process. We are hopeful that we will \ncontinue to receive the goodwill and support of the \ninternational community in our efforts to \ninstitutionalize lasting peace, equity and prosperity in \nthe country. The United Nations upholds the noble \nvision of peace and security, development, justice and \nhuman rights for all. But if we look around the world, \nwe have a long way to go to achieve this. We still face \nconflicts, deprivation and demeaning poverty all \naround us. How can we achieve sustainable peace in \nthe world when there is so much inequity, deprivation \nand marginalization around us? We have to deal with \ntheir root causes. How can one justify the spending of \n$1.5 trillion on war weapons every year while more \nthan 2 billion people across the globe lack the basic \nnecessities of food, medicine, et cetera? \n In that context, I appeal to the United Nations to \ncome forward with a far-reaching and comprehensive \ndevelopment package. We need a new Marshall Plan \nfor the rebuilding and reconstruction of post-conflict \ncountries. Lip service and symbolic support are not \nenough. It is now time for a bold, visionary step to deal \nwith the complex problems of today that would be the \nmost cost-effective approach to deal with global \nproblems and ensure sustainable peace. \n The principles and purposes of the Organization \nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations \nrepresent the highest ideals of the global community. \nYet we live in an age of paradox. The gap between the \npoor and the rich is ever-widening. Today, the level of \ninequality between States is the highest of any time in \nthe past. Least developed countries (LDCs) \u2014 or, as I \nwould prefer to call them, underdeveloped countries \u2014 \nare facing the full force of the negative side of \nglobalization that is its deep structural constraints.  \n Growing joblessness is a major challenge for all \nof us. In this integrated world, the grinding poverty of \nthe masses, who number in the billions, is a recipe for \ndisaster. Islands of prosperity amid a sea of poverty are \nunsustainable, morally indefensible and economically \nundesirable. In a globalized and interconnected world, \nour destiny is inextricably intertwined. When my house \nis on fire, your house cannot be safe, and vice versa. \n The recurrence of economic and financial crises, \nfuel and food crises and the deeper structural crises \nhave vindicated the need to seriously review the \ncurrent economic paradigm. I believe that now is the \nright time for deeper soul-searching and the creation of \na new, just and scientific economic order. The new \nglobal economic order needs to deal with the current \nglobal volatility and the growing marginalization of \npoor and weaker economies. The financial, capital-\ndriven globalization process is increasingly exposing \nits inherent structural deficiencies and its \nincompatibility. Unless the interest of labour, the basic \nsource of human wealth, is duly integrated in this \nprocess, we may soon face the globalization of unrest \nand upheaval. The United Nations should act as the \nprincipal forum to examine that in a coherent, inclusive \nand holistic manner. \n Least developed countries face severe structural \nconstraints on their development efforts. Their \nvulnerabilities have been further aggravated by \nmultiple crises. Despite some good progress in \nachieving individual goals, LDCs as a group are mostly \noff-track in meeting the internationally agreed upon \ndevelopment goals, including those contained in the \nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). A rights-\nbased approach to development is a must. \n It is quite disheartening that even today about \n75 per cent of LDC populations live in abject poverty \nand hunger. This situation is unacceptable and must \ncome to an end sooner rather than later. Business as \nusual will not be a solution to deep-rooted problems. \nThe historically structured process of \u201cdevelopment of \nunderdevelopment\u201d needs to be structurally addressed. \n The Istanbul Declaration and Programme of \nAction must be implemented in their entirety and in an \neffective and timely manner. In particular, financing \nfor development should be ensured as per the \ncommitment that has been made. Duty-free, quota-free \n  \n \n11-51360 22 \n \nmarket access and supply-side capacity must be \nensured to LDCs. Investment, technology transfer and \nprivate sector development should be promoted in \nLDCs. They are essential to achieving the legitimate \naspirations of LDCs. A renewed and strengthened \nglobal partnership is critical to their implementation. \nWe do not want to see another missed opportunity for \nLDCs. \n Nepal, in its capacity as Chair of the LDCs, will \nmake every effort, in cooperation with our fellow \nLDCs, to ensure that the issues and concerns of LDCs \nremain high on the priority list of the United Nations \ndevelopment agenda. Similarly, the special difficulties \nof landlocked developing countries should be \nrecognized. Freedom of transit should be ensured to \nthem as a matter of right, together with the scaling up \nof support for trade facilitation and infrastructure \ndevelopment. \n Labour migration is a global phenomenon. We \nmust protect the rights of all migrant workers and their \nfamily members to ensure that globalization is fair to \nall. As Nepal\u2019s economy is increasingly dependent on \nremittances, that issue is very crucial for us. \n Clearly, climate change has emerged as one of the \ngreatest challenges of the twenty-first century. Global \nwarming has precipitated the melting of the snow in \nthe Nepal Himalayas, a source of fresh water for over \n1 billion people who live in South Asia. We have \ntherefore taken the initiative of promoting the \nsustainable mountain agenda in order to highlight their \nspecial vulnerabilities and fragilities. Industrialized \ncountries should bear greater responsibility for that. \n There is an urgent need to make progress in \nclimate negotiations and to ensure enhanced and \npredictable financing. The United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development summit scheduled for \nnext year is critical to defining a more sustainable \ndevelopment path and to eradicating poverty for LDCs. \nThe sustainable development agenda should encompass \nall ecological considerations, including the crucial \nissue of sustainable mountain development. \n Nepal reiterates its call for the general and \ncomplete disarmament of all weapons of mass \ndestruction in a time-bound manner. Nepal strongly \nbelieves that regional mechanisms complement efforts \nto promote the global disarmament agenda. The United \nNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in \nAsia and the Pacific, located in Kathmandu, could be \ninstrumental in revitalizing the Kathmandu process to \nfacilitate dialogue and deliberations on confidence-\nbuilding in the region. \n Nepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations and calls for an expeditious \nconclusion of the negotiations on a comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism. We should \ndifferentiate between terrorism and struggles for \nfreedom. \n Nepal\u2019s commitment to human rights is deep and \nunflinching. We are fully aware that the protection and \npromotion of all human rights, including the right to \ndevelopment and fundamental freedoms, strengthens \nthe sustainability of peace and progress. We have \nestablished an independent constitutional body \u2014 the \nNational Human Rights Commission \u2014 as a watchdog \ninstitution. We are committed to building and \nstrengthening that specialized national institution as a \ntrue custodian of human rights. \n The General Assembly, which is the only \nuniversally representative body at the global level, \nneeds to be given commensurate power and authority \nto truly work as a world parliament. It should not \nremain toothless. Similarly, Nepal supports the \nexpansion in the membership of the Security Council \nin both categories. Reform must address all interrelated \nissues, such as representation, as well as transparency \nand accountability in the working methods of the \nSecurity Council. The role and contributions of smaller \nStates in the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity must be duly acknowledged. \n We underline the crucial role of the United \nNations in promoting international cooperation for \ndevelopment. Its role in shaping the policy debate on, \nand establishing global norms in, economic and \nfinancial matters must be strengthened. Nepal \nwelcomes all efforts aimed at promoting system-wide \ncoherence, including the operationalization of \nUN-Women. \n Nepal\u2019s participation in United Nations \npeacekeeping is long-standing and consistent. We \nremain steadfast in our commitment to international \npeace and security. Nepal has already provided more \nthan 80,000 peacekeepers, with 62 of our soldiers \nhaving laid down their lives in the line of duty. We \nwould therefore like to call for equitable representation \nat the leadership level. \n \n \n23 11-51360 \n \n In recent times, we have witnessed an outpouring \nof popular sentiment calling for change and freedom \naround the world. We believe that this is a sign of a \nnew beginning, where people are asserting themselves \nas the masters of their own destinies. We applaud these \nchanges. We should support them based on the \nfundamental principles of the United Nations. \nHowever, no one should hijack the agenda of \ndemocracy for partisan ends. \n The long-drawn-out peace process in the Middle \nEast is a matter of serious concern for us all. We must \nfind a comprehensive and just solution to these \nproblems. It is our principled position that we support a \nfully independent and sovereign Palestinian State based \non United Nations resolutions. We look forward to its \nmaterialization at the earliest date. \n Finally, let me reiterate that the United Nations \nprinciples must be holistic and should be pursued in a \nbalanced manner. The United Nations should not only \nbe the custodian of its noble principles; it must deliver \non its promises. Let it not be a mere umbrella for the \nbig Powers. In today\u2019s globalized world, the United \nNations has more responsibility than ever before for \ncreating an inclusive and just global order. Let it not \nfalter in its historic duties. \n Let the United Nations serve the larger interests \nof the poor and the weakest segment of the \ninternational community. Let the economic \ntransformation of the least developed countries with a \nrights-based approach be at the top of the United \nNations agenda. Let the United Nations not fail the \naspirations of millions of people for freedom, equality \nand prosperity. Let its vision be translated into a visible \nchange in the lives of oppressed people. Last but not \nleast, let us keep in mind that either we all reach the \ngoal of global peace and prosperity together, or nobody \nwill."

        "file_text": "First, on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, \nPresident of the Republic and Head of State of \nCameroon, and on behalf of the delegation that I have \nthe honour to lead at the current session, I warmly \ncongratulate the President on his unanimous election to \npreside over the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \n To Mr. Joseph Deiss, his predecessor, we wish to \nsay how much his work as President of the Assembly at \nits sixty-fifth session was appreciated, just as \nCameroon appreciated his visit to Yaound\u00e9 in January \nduring his African visit. \n We also once again sincerely congratulate \nMr. Ban Ki-moon on the extension of his mandate as \nSecretary-General for a further five years. His \ndetermination and commitment to the United Nations \nduring his first term of office contributed to the \ninitiatives and important actions of the United Nations \nto promote peace and social and economic \ndevelopment throughout the world. He will have our \nbest wishes and constant support during his second \nterm, when we hope that he will successfully continue \nhis  work in every area within the framework of the \nUnited Nations agenda, particularly in terms of \naligning and harmonizing the points of view of the \nvarious Member States.  \n This year a new Member, the Republic of South \nSudan, joined the Organization. We had the \nopportunity to solemnly, but joyfully, welcome it on \n14 July, following its declaration of independence a \nfew days earlier. The arrival of this new State allows a \ndark chapter to be closed: decades of war, with a litany \nof woes, death, displaced persons, tears, human tragedy \nand suffering among the people of that land on our \nAfrican continent.  \n Cameroon takes the opportunity to join in paying \na well-deserved tribute to the leaders of the Sudan and \nof South Sudan, as well as to the United Nations and \nthe African Union, for their tireless work in supporting \nthe negotiations before the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement was signed in 2005, as well as during its \nsubsequent implementation. The United Nations \nMission in the Sudan and the recent creation of the \nUnited Nations Mission in the Republic of South \nSudan, whose task it is to support the new State in the \nprocess of consolidating its institutions and democracy, \nshow the unique, decisive role played by the United \nNations, fully in line with the fundamental purposes \nand principles of its founding Charter. \n Cameroon welcomes the role that the United \nNations has played in that regard. In more general \nterms, we believe that its role in conflict management \nshould be played in a fully transparent way and in line \nwith the principles, purposes and ideals of the Charter, \nwhich calls for the peaceful settlement of international \ndisputes and for respect for the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of States.  \n That is where the theme selected for this sixty-\nsixth session \u2014 \u201cThe role of mediation in the \nsettlement of disputes through peaceful means\u201d \u2014 \ntakes on its importance, reminding us that the Charter \nstates that the Organization\u2019s primary purpose is \n  \u201cTo maintain international peace and \nsecurity, and to that end: to take effective \ncollective measures for the prevention and \nremoval of threats to the peace, and for the \nsuppression of acts of aggression or other \nbreaches of the peace, and to bring about by \npeaceful means, and in conformity with the \nprinciples of justice and international law, \nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \npeace\u201d. \n The Charter also calls upon Members of the \nUnited Nations to  \n  \n \n11-51378 16 \n \n \u201crefrain in their international relations from the \nthreat or use of force against the territorial \nintegrity or political independence of any state, or \nin any other manner inconsistent with the \nPurposes of the United Nations.\u201d \n International disputes, and a fortiori internal \nconflicts, should be settled peacefully in line with our \nCharter, through negotiation and mediation, rather than \nby recourse to force.  \n That is the position that the African Union, the \ncontinental organization of African States, ceaselessly \nadvocates and defends. Cameroon agrees with the \nAfrican Union that any lasting solution to an internal \npolitical crisis must take into account the State\u2019s \nnational political institutions and the legitimate \naspirations of the people concerned, but also the \nmaintenance of the country\u2019s unity and territorial \nintegrity. It considers that priority must be given to \nmeasures that guarantee the maintenance of peace, the \npromotion of national reconciliation and the \nconsolidation of a democratic culture and ownership of \nthe rule of law by Governments and citizens. \n With regard to some current burning questions in \nthis area, and particularly with regard to management \nof the Libyan issue, Cameroon noted the General \nAssembly decision on 19 September approving the \nmandate of the Libyan delegation established by the \nNational Transitional Council, as well as the statement \nmade here by the Chairperson of the African Union \nCouncil on 21 September, which was preceded by the \n19 September press release. Fully in line with our \nexternal policy, Cameroon will respect the decision and \nstatement in the context of its bilateral relations with \nthe Libyan State, and within various international \ninstitutions. \n It is the international community\u2019s duty to \nsupport States and their peoples in the management of \ntheir national affairs, and in seeking to ensure that they \ncontrol their own fate. Governments, for their part, \nmust seek to respond to the legitimate aspirations and \nthe many and varied expectations of their peoples in all \nareas.  \n In Cameroon the Government is seeking to \nimplement the reforms that began a few years ago to \nconsolidate national political institutions and \nmodernize our democracy. At the same time, it has \nestablished policies to create an environment \nfavourable to development and revenue-generating \nactivities and to improve the living conditions of its \npeople, in a context of repeated international economic \nand financial crises, which have disturbing effects on \nthe national programmes of States. \n In economic terms, my country has had since \n2009 a real moral compass for national players, both \npublic and private, and for our external partners: the \nGrowth and Employment Strategy document. The \ndocument is part of a comprehensive shared vision of \ndevelopment for Cameroon up to 2035, called Vision \n2035. It emphasises seeking increased growth, job \ncreation, poverty reduction and a tangible improvement \nin the living conditions of our people. The strategy will \nbe implemented by, in particular, large-scale, labour-\nintensive building projects throughout the country, with \nparticular emphasis on the energy sectors, mining and \nthe creation of human capital. \n In political terms, and with regard to elections, \nour independent electoral institution \u2014 Elections \nCameroon (ELECAM) \u2014 set up in 2006 and made \nresponsible for the entire electoral process, from the \nelectoral register to the organization of the ballot, the \noversight of elections and referendums, has become \nfully operational, and has a number of local offices. \n Giving the right to vote to Cameroonians living \nabroad is part of the law that was promulgated this \nyear. The electoral register has been updated by \nELECAM, and incentives, such as free national \nidentity cards, were given to encourage a large turn-out \nat the elections. Furthermore, legal provisions have \nbeen established to ensure the transparency, freedom, \nhonesty and credibility of the elections in a context of \nconsensual democracy.  \n In that regard, there is a deadline of importance to \nthe Cameroonian people in the short term. On \n9 October they will have the right to elect their leader \nand determine their future, as is the case in all \ndemocracies. I am referring to the presidential election. \nWith all of the provisions that I have just mentioned, \nmade with the technical assistance of United Nations \nspecialized agencies, we believe that the conditions \nnow exist to ensure that the election takes place \npeacefully. Independent national and foreign observers \nwill be authorized to monitor the presidential election.  \n I wish to highlight with pride the political \nmaturity demonstrated by the people of Cameroon. \nThey have always been able to make the best choice in \norder to ensure that we preserve national achievements, \n \n \n17 11-51378 \n \nparticularly with regard to peace and national unity, \nand the people have been able to work together in a \nspirit of patriotism, and with a high sense of a citizen\u2019s \nresponsibilities when required to meet the various \nchallenges, both external and internal, that they \nencounter and have encountered throughout their \nhistory. \n I reiterate Cameroon\u2019s commitment to peace \nthrough mediation, as well as its commitment to \ndemocracy and good governance, both internally and \ninternationally.  \n I close by emphasizing my country\u2019s commitment \nto the ideals of the Charter, and to those set out in the \nConstitutive Act of the African Union. My country \nwishes to see enhanced cooperation between those two \ninternational institutions, as they deal with issues \naffecting African countries, in line with the spirit and \nletter of those two international instruments.  \n This has been, on behalf of the President of the \nRepublic of Cameroon, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, \nHead of State and head of Cameroonian diplomacy, our \ncontribution to the general debate at the sixty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations, \nwhich is our common international Organization with \nglobal competence."

        "file_text": "Liberia congratulates you, \nMr. President, on your election to the important office \nof President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. We are confident that you will steer the work \nof this session in a manner which brings pride to your \ngreat country, the State of Qatar. Mr. President, we \nwish you well and pledge Liberia\u2019s full support to you \nin pursuit of the priorities which you have identified. \n Let me also pay tribute to your predecessor, His \nExcellency Joseph Deiss of Switzerland, for the \neffective manner in which he conducted the affairs of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. His \nsound and outstanding leadership enabled the session \nto register many achievements. \n We warmly congratulate the Secretary-General, \nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his unanimous \nre-election, and extend the highest commendation to \nhim for his vision and foresight, and for the tireless \nefforts with which he continues to administer the \nOrganization. We embrace the priorities which he has \nset for his second term, which are centred on \nsustainable development. \n It gives me great pleasure to welcome and \ncongratulate the Republic of South Sudan upon its \nadmission as the 193rd Member of the United Nations \nand to assure it of Liberia\u2019s friendship, support and \nsolidarity. \n The theme chosen for this year\u2019s general debate, \n\u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means\u201d, could not have been selected at a \nmore opportune time. Communities within our world \ncontinue to be polarized by conflicts which have their \nroots in political marginalization and socio-economic \ninequities. Despite global interdependence, inter-State \nrelations are still constrained by divergent ideological \nconvictions and structural inequalities in the global \neconomic system. These have resulted in divisions \nwhich undermine our efforts to move as one global \ncommunity towards sustainable development. \n Mediation, as part of preventive diplomacy, is \nindeed a powerful dispute-resolution mechanism. The \nUnited Nations has a central role in promoting \nmediation in pursuit of peace. The good offices of the \nSecretary-General remain critical to the mediation \nefforts of the United Nations. Regional and subregional \norganizations are assuming an increasingly active and \ncomplementary role in mediation and the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes. These initiatives must not only \nbe acknowledged and encouraged but also supported \nby the global community. \n  \n \n11-51384 8 \n \n As a post-conflict country, Liberia has benefited \nimmensely from numerous mediation efforts that \ninclude national, regional and international initiatives \naimed at restoring and maintaining stability in the \ncountry. Our experience leads us to suggest that greater \nemphasis be placed on preventive measures, and that \nthe tools of mediation be employed as soon as early \nwarning signs of conflict emerge. The benefits of \nestablishing an early-warning system that will deal \nwith potentially explosive situations before they \ndegenerate into full-blown infernos are obvious. \n It has been nearly a decade since this body and \nfriendly nations intervened to restore Liberia to \nnormalcy. That intervention ended a disastrous 14-year \ncivil war and created conditions for the deployment of \nthe United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), the \nestablishment of a transitional Government and the \ndemocratic election of Africa\u2019s first female President. \n Consistent with our commitment to national \nrecovery and post-war reconstruction, we have \ndeveloped programmes and policies specifically aimed \nat lifting Liberians to higher levels of productivity, \nreviving basic services, restoring infrastructure and \nre-establishing the rule of law. Overall, we are making \nprogress on all of these fronts and building a more \ninclusive society in which the full potential of all of \nour citizens can be harnessed. \n In this endeavour, special emphasis has been \nplaced on the empowerment of women and their \nparticipation in all aspects of the national endeavour. A \nwell-crafted gender policy is enabling the Government \nto address the concerns of women and girls. We \nconsider the creation of the gender entity UN-Women \nto be an important positive development in the context \nof the United Nations effort to promote women\u2019s \nempowerment. Liberia pledges its fullest support for \nthe success of this important body. \n Cognizant that youths constitute the highest \npercentage of our population, we are committed to \ndeveloping programmes that will strengthen and \nempower them for future leadership. We hope that the \naction plan adopted by the recent United Nations High-\nlevel Meeting on Youth will garner international \nsupport for our youth programmes. \n We are continuing to progress in our efforts to \nreform our security sector. Special attention is focused \non building the capacity of the Liberian National \nPolice. However, we remain deeply concerned about \nevents affecting security in the Mano River Basin. That \nis why we are thankful to the Security Council for \nextending the mandate of UNMIL. \n Liberia is pleased to have been placed on the \nagenda of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). The \nLiberia configuration of the PBC and the \nPeacebuilding Support Office have worked with the \nLiberian Government and other stakeholders in \ndeveloping the Liberia priority plan, which focuses on \nsecurity-sector reform, strengthening the rule of law \nand accelerating national reconciliation. \n I would like at this juncture to thank His \nExcellency Prince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Zeid Al-Hussein, \nPermanent Representative of Jordan and Chairman of \nthe Liberia configuration, and the configuration\u2019s \nmembers for their commitment and dedication. In the \nsame spirit, I also commend His Excellency \nMr. Eug\u00e8ne-Richard Gasana, Chairman of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, and its members for their \nsupport for the configuration. \n We would be remiss if we did not acknowledge \nthe significant role being played by the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in the \nmaintenance of peace and security in the subregion. \nECOWAS member States are contributing tangibly to \npeacebuilding in Liberia by strengthening capacity, \nespecially in the technical area. We are also \ncollaborating as a subregion in addressing the common \nproblems of transnational organized crime, human and \ndrug trafficking, and the illicit trade in small arms and \nlight weapons. \n Liberia is poised to conduct another democratic \nelection on 11 October. It will test our commitment to \ndemocratic governance and peaceful coexistence. \nEvery action is being taken to ensure that the elections \nare free, fair, transparent and credible. We invite the \ninternational community to observe and monitor these \nelections. \n Despite the significant gains made in improving \nthe living conditions of our people, we realize that far \nmore needs to be done to fully meet their aspirations. \nHowever, negative economic forces continue to hamper \nglobal growth. This situation has had repercussions for \nall countries. Although the resulting effects have \nimpacted developing countries generally, those most \naffected are in Africa, where the crippling effects of \nexternal debt, deteriorating terms of trade, decline in \ninvestment and capital flows are debilitating. \n \n \n9 11-51384 \n \n Mr. Cancela (Uruguay), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n Post-conflict countries are even more severely \naffected. This is why we have particular appreciation \nfor the outcome of the Fourth United Nations \nConference on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) \nconvened in Istanbul in May. We hope that the Istanbul \nProgramme of Action will bring real change for LDCs. \n Food security remains a concern for many \ndeveloping countries. The World Bank estimates that \n44 million people have slipped into poverty since June \nbecause of rising food prices. This unfortunate \nsituation should be addressed with urgency. We must \nact now, effectively and cooperatively, to roll back the \nadverse impacts of rising food prices and protect \ncommunities. \n Our Government is responding to the current rise \nin food prices with immediate action under the policy \nEnding Hunger in Liberia, which aims to strengthen \nthe entire agricultural food chain from securing quality \nseeds for farming in productive lowlands to connecting \nfarmers to local markets and eventually to regional and \nglobal ones. Simultaneously, we are deepening our \npartnership with the Food and Agricultural \nOrganization of the United Nations and other United \nNations bodies for long-term investments in \nmechanized agriculture to achieve food security in \nLiberia. \n While we seek food security, we are equally \nmindful of the need for health security. Liberia is \namong countries with the highest maternal and child \nmortality rates in the world. This is due primarily to \nthe lack of skilled health workers, poor health delivery \nsystems and inadequate medicines and supplies. This is \nwhy we welcome the new initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral aimed at improving the health of women and \nchildren. \n I wish to state my country\u2019s position on some of \nthe prevailing situations that threaten peace, security \nand international cooperation in our world. The \nunresolved riddle in Somalia presents a strong \nchallenge to the United Nations in relieving the Somali \npeople of the tragedy and cruelty they have endured for \nmany years. The phenomenon of famine has \nexacerbated the situation in that country and affected \nlivelihoods in the Horn and East Africa. Those \ncircumstances necessitate an urgent call for action. \n The question of peace in the Middle East has \nhovered over the world for far too long. Liberia \nbelieves that whether deliberations take place in the \nSecurity Council or the General Assembly, dialogue \nbetween the parties remains the most viable option for \nending the stalemate towards an independent Palestine. \nWe therefore call on Israel and Palestine to \ndemonstrate a concrete commitment to engaging each \nother in a constructive dialogue that will achieve the \ndesired two-State solution. \n Suppressive actions by Governments to frustrate \nthe desire of their people for democratic reforms must \nnever be condoned because they undermine \ninternational peace and security. Coherent and concrete \nactions by the Security Council are critical in \naddressing those situations. Liberia welcomes the new \nleadership of Libya under the National Transitional \nCouncil (NTC). After more than four decades of \nsuppression, the Libyan people have high expectations \nfor the restoration of their freedom and liberties. We \nencourage the NTC to move quickly to restore Libya to \nnormalcy by establishing an inclusive transitional \nGovernment that will organize democratic elections. \n As the United Nations grows in membership and \nexperience, Liberia joins other nations in calling for a \nmore democratic Security Council that reflects realities \nof the twenty-first century. Africa expects to have \ngreater representation in a reformed Security Council. \nMore broadly, we encourage the Secretary-General\u2019s \ncontinuing effort to modernize the organization. \n Finally, it is my hope that Member States will \nwork together to advance the cause of our common \nhumanity, and make the world a better place in which \nto live."

        "file_text": "I have the pleasure of congratulating you, Sir, \non your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure you of the \nfull and sincere collaboration of the Holy See. I also \ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nwho during this session, on 1 January 2012, will begin \nhis second term.  \n I would also like to cordially welcome the \ndelegation of South Sudan, which became the \n193rd Member State of the Organization last July. \n Every year, the general debate offers the \nopportunity to address the principal questions that \nconcern humanity in search of a better future for all. \nThe challenges facing the international community are \nmany and difficult. They bring ever more clearly in \nfocus the profound interdependence within the family \nof nations, which sees in the United Nations an \nimportant agent, despite its limitations, for identifying \nand implementing solutions to major international \nproblems.  \n Without attempting an exhaustive survey, my \ndelegation wishes to reflect on a few of the priority \nchallenges so that the concept of the family of nations \ncan increasingly take shape. \n The first challenge is a humanitarian one. It calls \nthe whole international community \u2014 or better, the \nfamily of nations \u2014 to look after its weakest members. \nIn certain parts of the world, such as the Horn of \nAfrica, we are, sadly, facing grave humanitarian \nemergencies that force millions of people \u2014 the \nmajority women and children \u2014 to leave their homes, \nlarge numbers of them being victims of drought, \nfamine and malnutrition.  \n The Holy See renews its appeal to the \ninternational community, expressed many times by \nPope Benedict XVI, to amplify and support \nhumanitarian policies in those areas and to work to \nconcretely address the various factors that amplify \ntheir vulnerability. \n \n \n41 11-51670 \n \n These humanitarian emergencies make clear the \nneed to find innovative ways to put to work the \nprinciple of the responsibility to protect, at the base of \nwhich is the recognition of the unity of the human \nfamily and the innate dignity of every man and every \nwoman. As is known, that principle points to the \nresponsibility of the international community to \nintervene in situations in which Governments on their \nown cannot \u2014 or do not wish to \u2014 comply with their \nprimary responsibility to protect their populations \nagainst grave violations of human rights and the effects \nof humanitarian crises. If States are no longer capable \nof guaranteeing that protection, the international \ncommunity must intervene with the juridical means \nforeseen in the United Nations Charter and other \ninternational instruments. \n However, it must be recalled that there is a risk \nthat that principle may be invoked in certain \ncircumstances as a pretext to use military force. It is \ngood to recall that even the use of force in keeping \nwith the United Nations rules should be a temporary \nsolution, a true emergency measure, accompanied and \nfollowed by a concrete commitment to pacification. \n For that reason, in taking up the challenge of the \nresponsibility to protect, we must engage in a deeper \nsearch for the means to prevent and manage conflicts, \nexploring all possible diplomatic avenues through \nnegotiation and constructive dialogue, noting and \nencouraging even the weakest signs of willingness to \nnegotiate or desire for reconciliation on the part of the \nparties involved. \n The responsibility to protect must be thought of \nnot as military intervention alone \u2014 which should \nalways be the last recourse \u2014 but above all as a \nrequirement that the international community be united \nin facing crises. It must create forums for genuine, \nsincere negotiations, support the moral force of law, \nseek the common good and encourage Governments, \ncivil society and public opinion to find the causes of \nand offer solutions to crises of all kinds. I must act in \nclose collaboration and solidarity with the affected \npopulations and place above all else the integrity and \nsecurity of all citizens.  \n It is therefore important that the responsibility to \nprotect, understood in that sense, should be the \ncriterion and motivation that underlies all the work of \nStates and of the United Nations to restore peace, \nsecurity and the human rights. Moreover, the long and \ngenerally successful history of peacekeeping \noperations and the more recent initiatives in \npeacebuilding can offer valuable lessons for conceiving \nmodels for implementing the responsibility to protect \nin full respect for international law and for the \nlegitimate interests of all the parties involved. \n Respect for freedom of religion is a fundamental \nfactor in peacebuilding, the recognition of human \ndignity and the safeguarding of the human rights. This \nis the second challenge I would like to reflect on. \n The situations in which the right to freedom of \nreligion is violated or is denied to believers of different \nreligions are unfortunately many. We have witnessed \nrising intolerance for religious reasons. Christians are \nthe religious group that currently suffers the greatest \npersecution because of their faith.  \n The lack of respect for freedom of religion \nthreatens security and peace and hinders authentic \nintegral human development. The particular weight of \na given religion in a nation should never mean that \ncitizens of other faiths are discriminated against in \nsocial life or, worse still, that violence against them is \ntolerated. In that connection, it is important that a \ncommon commitment to recognize and promote the \nreligious freedom of every person and every \ncommunity be promoted by engaging in sincere \ninterreligious dialogue, encouraged and supported by \nGovernments and international bodies.  \n I reiterate the concerned appeal made by the Holy \nSee to authorities and religious leaders to adopt \neffective measures for the protection of religious \nminorities, wherever they are threatened. In that way, \nbelievers of all faiths everywhere will be able to live in \nsecurity and continue to make a contribution to their \nsociety.  \n In thinking about the situation in some countries, \nI would like to repeat in particular that Christians are \ncitizens like any other citizens, connected to their \nhomeland and faithful to all of their national duties. It \nis natural that they should enjoy all the rights of \ncitizenship, freedom of conscience and worship, \nfreedom in teaching and education and freedom in the \nuse of communications media. \n Moreover, in some countries, although much \nimportance is placed on pluralism and tolerance, \nparadoxically there is a tendency to consider religion \nas something foreign to modern society or even as a \n  \n \n11-51670 42 \n \ndestabilizing force. Various means are sought to \nmarginalize religion and prevent it from having any \ninfluence on social life.  \n But how can anyone deny the contribution of the \nworld\u2019s great religions to the development of \ncivilization? As Pope Benedict XVI stressed, the \nsincere search for God has led to greater respect for \nhuman dignity. For example, Christian communities, \nwith their heritage of values and principles, have \ncontributed much to making individuals and peoples \naware of their own identity and their dignity, as well as \nto the establishment of rule-of-law institutions and the \nrecognition of human rights and their corresponding \nresponsibilities. From that standpoint, it is important \nthat believers, today as yesterday, feel free to offer \ntheir contribution to the promotion of a more just \nhuman order, not only through their responsible \ninvolvement in civic, economic and political life, but \nalso through the witness of their charity and faith. \n A third challenge that the Holy See would like to \nbring to the attention of the Assembly is the continuing \nglobal economic and financial crisis.  \n We all know that a fundamental element of the \ncurrent crisis is the deficit in ethics in the economic \nstructures. Ethics are not an external element of the \neconomy; the economy has no future if it has no moral \nelement. In other words, the ethical dimension is \nessential in addressing economic problems. The \neconomy does not function only through market self-\nregulation, and even less through agreements that are \nlimited to accommodating the interests of the most \npowerful.  \n The economy needs an ethical raison d\u2019\u00eatre in \norder to work for humankind. The notion of producing \nresources and goods \u2014 that is, the economy \u2014 and of \nmanaging them strategically \u2014 that is, politics \u2014 \nwithout seeking to do good through those same acts \u2014 \nthat is, without ethics \u2014 has proven to be a na\u00efve or \ncynical illusion, and always fatal. Moreover, every \neconomic decision has a moral consequence.  \n The economy therefore needs ethics to function \nproperly \u2014 not just any ethic, but a people-centred \nethic that can offer prospects to new generations. \nEconomic and commercial activities oriented towards \ndevelopment should be able to effectively reduce \npoverty and alleviate the suffering of the most \ndisenfranchised.  \n In that regard, the Holy See encourages \nstrengthening official development assistance in \naccordance with the Group of Eight commitments \nmade at Gleneagles. My delegation hopes that the \ndebates on this theme at the forthcoming High-level \nDialogue on Financing for Development will bring the \nexpected results.  \n Furthermore, the Holy See has repeatedly \nstressed the importance of new and more in-depth \nthinking on the meaning of the economy and its \nobjectives, as well as a forward-looking review of the \nglobal trade and financial architecture to correct its \ndysfunctions and distortions. This review of \ninternational economic rules must form part of wider \nefforts to forge a new global development model. \nIndeed, the state of our planet\u2019s environmental health, \nand above all the cultural and moral crisis of \nhumankind \u2014 the symptoms of which have been \nevident around the world for some time \u2014 demand \nthis. \n These considerations should also inspire the work \nof the forthcoming United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development, to be held in June, on the \nconviction that \u201cHuman beings are at the centre of \nconcerns for sustainable development\u201d, as stated in the \nPrinciple 1 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment \nand Development.  \n The sense of environmental responsibility and \npreservation should be guided by our awareness of \nbeing a family of nations. The idea of \u201cfamily\u201d \nimmediately evokes something more than merely \nfunctional relationships or a simple convergence of \ninterests. A family is by nature a community based on \ninterdependence, mutual trust, mutual aid and sincere \nrespect. Its full development is based not on the \nsupremacy of the strongest, but on the attention paid to \nthe weakest and most marginalized, and its \nresponsibility extends to future generations. Respect \nfor the environment should make us more attuned to \nthe needs of the most disenfranchised. It should create \na development strategy centred on the individual that \npromotes solidarity and the shared responsibility of all, \nincluding future generations. \n This strategy can only benefit from the United \nNations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, planned \nfor 2012. An unregulated and non-transparent arms \ntrade has significant negative repercussions. It hampers \nintegral human development and heightens the risk of \n \n \n43 11-51670 \n \nconflicts, especially internal conflicts, and instability. \nIt fosters a culture of violence and impunity, which is \noften linked to such criminal activities as drug \ntrafficking, trafficking in human beings and piracy. \nThese are becoming ever more serious international \nproblems.  \n The results of the current arms trade treaty \nprocess will test the true willingness of States to \nassume their moral and legal responsibilities in that \nregard. The international community, conscious of the \ngreat numbers of people affected by the illegal trade in \narms and ammunition and aware of their suffering, \nmust focus on concluding an arms trade treaty that is \neffective and enforceable. Indeed, the primary \nobjective of the treaty should be not only to regulate \nthe trade in conventional arms and obstruct the black \nmarket, but also and most importantly to protect human \nlife and build a world more respectful of human \ndignity. \n Indeed, the United Nations\u2019 contribution to \nbuilding a world more respectful of human dignity will \ndemonstrate its ability to effectively carry out its \nmission, which is to help the family of nations to \npursue the common objectives of peace, security and \nintegral development for all. \n The Holy See is also concerned about the events \nunfolding in some countries of North Africa and the \nMiddle East. I would like to take this opportunity to \nrenew the appeal made by the Holy Father Benedict \nXVI, who called on all citizens, particularly young \npeople, to do their utmost to promote the common \ngood and build societies in which poverty is overcome, \nin which every political choice is inspired by respect \nfor human beings and in which peace and harmony will \ntriumph over divisions, hatred and violence. \n A final observation concerns Palestine\u2019s request \nfor recognition as a Member State of the United \nNations, made here on 23 September by the President \nof the Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Mahmoud \nAbbas. The Holy See views this initiative as an attempt \nto find a definitive solution, with the support of the \ninternational community, to the question already \naddressed by the General Assembly in its resolution \n181 (II) of 29 November 1947. That fundamental \ndocument sets down the legal framework for the \nexistence of two States. One of them has already been \nborn, while the other has not yet been established, \nalthough nearly 65 years have passed. \n The Holy See is convinced that if one desires \npeace, brave decisions must be taken. It hopes that the \ncompetent bodies of the United Nations are resolved to \nhelp effectively implement the final objective, that is, \nachieving the Palestinians\u2019 right to have their own \nindependent and sovereign State and the Israelis\u2019 right \nto security, both States with internationally recognized \nborders.  \n The response of the United Nations, whatever it \nmay be, will not be a complete solution. Lasting peace \ncan be achieved only through good-faith negotiations \nbetween Israelis and Palestinians, avoiding actions or \nconditions that contradict declarations of goodwill. The \nHoly See therefore urges the parties to return to \nnegotiations with resolve. It urgently appeals to the \ninternational community to increase its commitment \nand stimulate its creativity and initiatives in order to \nreach a lasting peace, in respect for the rights of the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians."

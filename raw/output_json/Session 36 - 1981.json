        "file_text": "Mr. President, please accept my congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and my wishes for success in your responsible work.\n44.\tAllow me also to congratulate the representatives of Vanuatu and Belize on the admission of their States to membership of the United Nations.\n45.\tThe current session of the General Assembly is taking place in an extremely complicated international situation, characterized by a dangerous intensification of tension in the world. The question now is in which direction humanity will proceed: whether along the road to easing tension, maintaining and further developing detente and strengthening international peace and security; or along the road to militarism and confrontation, which would lead to a devastating nuclear catastrophe. That situation predicates a special role for the United Nations, whose basic task is to serve as an effective instrument for ensuring peaceful coexistence and cooperation among States.\n46.\tThe causes for the aggravation of the international situation are the actions of militaristic circles of the United States, which have resurrected their claims to world supremacy and have stated their intention to resolve world problems from a position of strength. They are now attempting to upset the established strategic balance, to obtain military superiority over the countries of the socialist community and to acquire dominating positions on a global scale.\n47.\tIn order to conceal their adventurist intentions they are whipping up a slanderous campaign about the myth of the so-called Soviet military threat and encouraging distrust and hostile attitudes towards the socialist countries. At the same time they are continuing their unprecedented military buildup and provoking a new round of the arms race. With the decision to deploy new American medium range nuclear missiles in Western Europe and to produce the neutron weapon, which is designed chiefly for Europe, the old continent has been assigned the fate of being the theater of a devastating nuclear war.\n48.\tThe United States is increasing its military presence in various parts of the world. Entire regions, thousands of kilometers away from the United States, are declared \\\"spheres of vital American interests\\\". A rapid deployment force has been created, existing military bases are being enlarged and modernized and new ones are being built. The disarmament talks are being stalled and existing agreements in that field are being undermined. The doctrine of the possibility of waging a limited nuclear war is extremely dangerous in that respect.\n49.\tCertain circles in the United States are doing everything possible to involve their allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] in carrying out their own militaristic plans.\n50.\tThe imperialist forces are attempting to raise barriers to halt the progressive changes in a number of States in Asia, Africa and Latin America, pursuing a policy of blackmail and provocation, interfering in their internal affairs and threatening to use force. They openly support reactionary dictatorship regimes, which conduct a policy of mass terror against their own peoples. The forces of imperialism are doing everything possible to check the liberation struggle of peoples; they take the liberty of describing national liberation movements as international terrorism and, under the guise of combating terrorism, they are trying to stifle the legitimate aspirations of peoples to freedom, independence and social progress.\n51.\tOf course, the aggressive policy of imperialism cannot bring about a peaceful, just and lasting settlement of the existing conflicts. On the contrary, it exacerbates them and creates new crises and new hotbeds of tension.\n52.\tAn unseemly role in that dangerous game is being played by the Peking hegemonists, who are entering into open military and political collusion with the most reactionary forces of imperialism.\n53.\tThose are only a few of the most substantive aspects of the present situation, which is cause for concern and anxiety on our part. However, we believe that there are no grounds for pessimism. The situation is indeed complex, but not hopeless. Besides those forces which have worsened the international situation, there exist certain factors in the world which continue to exert a stabilizing influence upon international developments and which contribute to the maintenance of peace and actively counteract the danger of war. The most powerful of those factors is the will of millions of people who are vitally interested in preserving the life and peaceful future of the present and succeeding generations.\n54.\tA way out of the present complicated situation would be to hold a wide-ranging and frank dialog on all contentious issues of international relations, based on the principles of equality, equal security and mutual respect for the interests involved. We are deeply convinced that there is no problem which cannot be solved through negotiations,\n55.\tAs Todor Zhivkov, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, stated recently:\n\\\". . . what we need now is a dialog, not confrontation; a dialog between the USSR and the United States; a dialog between the East and the West; a dialog between States, parties, politicians and nations; a dialog seeking ways of preventing war, safeguarding peace and promoting detente, cooperation and disarmament.\\\"\n56.\tA sound basis for such a dialog is to be found in the Program for Peace adopted by the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the peaceful initiatives put forward by the Soviet Union, the proposals made by States parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the constructive ideas formulated at the Crimea meetings of the heads of the countries of the socialist community. Such is also the essence of the concrete proposals set forth by the twelfth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.\n57.\tThe acceleration of the arms race and the constant increase of expenditures on the production of weapons of mass destruction have reached such dimensions as to render very real the threat of a world catastrophe. The elimination of that threat is the cardinal problem which must be solved by States and by Government leaders as well as by the international community, which is becoming increasingly aware of the aggressive and inhuman nature of the present policy of the forces of militarism and is ever more resolutely protesting against it. The protest movement in Europe has become particularly widespread. The European nations categorically oppose turning our continent into an arena for a devastating nuclear war.\n58.\tNaturally, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, as a European country, is vitally interested in preventing that danger. We call for a successful conclusion to the Madrid meeting and for the convening of a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe. Significant possibilities for progress in the field of military detente are provided by the readiness of the Soviet Union to have confidence-building measures extend over the entire European territory of the country, provided that the Western States also agree correspondingly to extend their zone of confidence-building measures. Creating nuclear-weapon free zones on the European continent and turning the Mediterranean into a region of lasting peace and cooperation could also be a substantial contribution to strengthening security throughout the world.\n59.\tThe implementation of the NATO decision to station new American medium-range missiles in Western Europe will upset the present military balance not only from a tactical but also from a strategic point of view. When speaking about balance, we must not forget the forward based American nuclear weapons as well as those nuclear weapons deployed aboard airplanes and aircraft carriers. That is why we have repeatedly called for immediate negotiations to limit nuclear weapons in Europe, and we welcome the agreement reached a few days ago between the Soviet Union and the United States to begin such negotiations.\n60.\tThe new neutron menace must be nipped in the bud. We resolutely support the complete prohibition of that barbaric weapon.\n61.\tThe socialist countries are making every effort to achieve specific results at the Vienna talks for the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. To that end, it is necessary for the Western States to abandon their nonconstructive approach and to show political willingness so that progress can be made at those negotiations.\n62.\tThe continuation of the SALT process is also an urgent necessity, dictated by the interests not only of the Soviet Union and the United States, but indeed those of all countries of the world.\n63.\tThe call by the Soviet Union for a restraint in the field of strategic armaments and for the continuation of talks on their limitation, while preserving everything positive reached in that field thus far, is specifically designed to serve that purpose.\n64.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria is of the opinion that among the multitude of disarmament issues the problem of nuclear disarmament is of paramount importance. To arrive at a radical solution of the problem, it is necessary immediately to begin talks on the termination of the manufacture of all types of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of their stocks until they are completely eliminated. At the same time, however, it is necessary to continue those efforts aimed at the final removal of the danger of the further proliferation of nuclear weapons, the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons tests, the non-introduction of nuclear weapons into the territories of States where there are no such weapons at present, and the strengthening of the security guarantees of non-nuclear-weapons States.\n65.\tIn that connection, the People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the proposal of the Soviet Union to include in the agenda of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly an item entitled \\\"Prevention of nuclear catastrophe: declaration of the General Assembly\\\". The adoption of a declaration on that question would block the way of those who would thoughtlessly push mankind into a thermonuclear conflict.\n66.\tThe proposal by the Soviet Union to conclude a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space [agenda item 128] also contributes to the task of curbing the arms race. Outer space can and must remain an arena to be used only for the peaceful endeavors of States for its exploration and utilization in the interest of all mankind. My country is making its own contribution to that process.\n67.\tAn active role in speeding up talks on the urgent questions concerning the limitation of the arms race can and, indeed, must be played by the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. That could pave the way for the holding of a world disarmament conference.\n68.\tMy country attaches particular importance to the idea of converting the region of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace, as well as to the well-known proposals for ensuring peace and guaranteeing security in the region of the Persian Gulf.\n69.\tWe welcome the readiness of the Soviet Union to reach an agreement with interested countries in the Far East on confidence-building measures in that important region. We also welcome the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic for the conclusion of a convention on mutual nonaggression and renunciation of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific [see A/36/388].\n70.\tThe eradication of hotbeds of tension and conflict, as well as the peaceful settlement of crises in various parts of the world, are of great importance in improving the international situation and enhancing international security.\n71.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria reaffirms its consistent position of principle with regard to the settlement of the Cyprus question by peaceful means, in the interests of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, while preserving the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and policy of nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus.\n72.\tCertain imperialist circles are to blame for the fact that the Middle East crisis continues to deteriorate and to threaten peace and security in the world as a whole. Israel is continuing its aggression against Lebanon and is blackmailing Syria and Libya, and it carried out a piratical raid against the nuclear research center in Iraq. Those actions add heat to an already complex situation in the Middle East.\n73.\tMore and more people now realize that the Camp David deals have no future. It is abundantly clear that a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem can only be reached through the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine and, above all, their right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State, and the guaranteeing of the sovereignty, security and independence of all States of that region. Such a comprehensive solution could be reached at a special international conference, with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.\n74.\tMy country calls for a settlement of the conflict between Iraq and Iran through negotiations.\n75.\tWe resolutely insist on the ending of the outside interference in the affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, and we favor the provision of guarantees that such interference will not be repeated. The problems surrounding Afghanistan can be settled by a political solution on the basis of the proposals made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on 24 August 1981 [A/361457].\n76.\tIt is essential to put a stop to Chinese aggression against the countries of IndoChina. The People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the proposal of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea to turn SouthEast Asia into a zone of peace, stability and cooperation [Af36l86] and to solve existing problems on a regional basis through negotiations.\n77.\tWe categorically reject any attempt to interfere in the domestic affairs of Kampuchea. The people of that country have already made their choice and no power can divert them from the chosen path. The existing political realities and the norms of international law require that the People's Republic of Kampuchea be represented in the United Nations and other international organizations by their legitimate representatives who have been duly elected by their peoples.\n78.\tBulgaria supports the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful solution of the Korean question.\n79.\tMy country resolutely condemns the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and South Africa's aggressive acts against Angola and other African States. South Africa's provocative conduct is a direct result of the assistance given to Pretoria by certain imperialist States. The People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the decisions of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, as well as those of the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, on Namibia. We reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Namibia in their struggle to exercise their right to self-determination and independence under the leadership of SWAPO.\n80.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria has always been and will continue to be on the side of those peoples fighting for national independence against colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, racial discrimination and apartheid.\n81.\tAn important task of the present day is the reconstruction of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. The achievement of that reconstruction depends directly on the developing and deepening of the process of detente and on the implementation of genuine measures of disarmament and measures to strengthen peace and security.\n82.\tTogether with the other countries of the socialist community, the People's Republic of Bulgaria has always sided with newly liberated States in their struggle for economic independence, for the elimination of exploitation and inequitable relations inherited from colonialism and imperialism, for the consolidation of their national independence and for the attainment of true national sovereignty that will guarantee their right to control their own natural resources'.\n83.\tWe consider that the United Nations is precisely the body in which it is possible to reach an effective solution of the broad and complex range of problems pertaining to international economic relations.\n84.\tThe solution of the problems of the present day necessitates the cooperation of all democratic, peace-loving and progressive forces. In this respect, an important role is being played by the nonaligned movement, which, through its struggle against imperialism, colonialism, war and aggression, exerts a positive influence on the development of the contemporary international situation.\n85.\tThe position of the People's Republic of Bulgaria on some of the most important questions of the present international situation is a direct reflection of the consistent foreign policy of my country, inspired as it is by the humane principles and ideals of struggling for peace and understanding among peoples. That policy stems from the very nature of the socialist system and from the fact that the People's Republic of Bulgaria is an inseparable part of the socialist community.\n86.\tThe peaceful policy of the People's Republic of Bulgaria also underlies its relations with its neighbors. My country will continue in the future to do everything in its power in order to turn the Balkan Peninsula into a zone of good-neighborliness, understanding and cooperation and into a factor making for peace in Europe and in the world. Further evidence of this is to be found in the constructive proposals which Todor Zhivkov, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, made from the rostrum of the twelfth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.\n87.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria is ready to sign bilateral agreements with its neighbors which would cover a code of good-neighborly relations, the renunciation of territorial claims and the use of the territories of the contracting parties for any hostile purposes and actions against each other, and readiness to develop bilateral relations in various spheres, as well as cooperation on a multilateral basis with the other Balkan countries on matters of mutual interest in those specific spheres where understanding has already been reached. The idea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Balkans also aims at enhancing peace and security in our peninsula.\n88.\tThis year we commemorate the 1,300th anniversary of the founding of our State. Our thirteen-century-long history is one of struggle, striving and aspiration by the best minds of Bulgaria in the interest of a better life, freedom and justice. The greatest achievement in its history was the triumph of the socialist revolution 37 years ago, when our people became the true master of its own destiny.\n89.\tThe Bulgaria of today views its future with optimism. For us there is no objective loftier or more precious than peace and social progress. The People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to pursue a consistently peaceful and constructive policy aimed at preserving and developing detente, strengthening international security and broadening understanding and cooperation among all countries and peoples in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n90.\tIt is precisely to the achievement of those objectives that the efforts of the People's Republic of Bulgaria will be directed.\n"

        "file_text": "The United Kingdom currently occupies the presidency of the European Community. My statement this year is therefore made on behalf of the Community and its member States and in the interests of brevity I shall not make the customary remarks on a national basis.\n59.\tIn this capacity, it is a particular pleasure to convey to you, Mr. President, at the outset of the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly, our very sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency at this session. I know that with your distinguished career and your considerable experience in the Organization you will guide our proceedings with skill and authority.\n60.\tI should also like to convey my warmest congratulations and admiration to the outgoing President for his efficient and capable conduct of the proceedings of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and also the eighth emergency special session.\n61.\tThe 10 members of the European Community also wish to express their gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral for a further year of strenuous efforts in the cause of peace, and I should like to join with my other colleagues who have congratulated the Republic of Vanuatu on its independence and its membership of this body.\n62.\tThree principles are fundamental to the European Community and underlie its activity in the world today and the role it seeks to play in the United Nations. First, the community was born from a determination to avoid the recurrence of war and from a desire for permanent and fruitful reconciliation. Secondly, it looks to partnership and collaboration between neighbors as a way to stimulate social and economic progress. And thirdly, it is based on a belief in the fundamental importance of human rights.\n63.\tThe first principle, its commitment to international reconciliation, explains why the European Community feels a duty to help where it can with the problems that afflict the world. AH conflicts, local, regional or global, adversely affect the possibilities for peace and progress throughout the world. All of them add up to the sum of human misery.\n64.\tThe conflict which perhaps poses most dangers is the Arab-Israel dispute. The European Community believes that it has a distinctive role to play in the , search for a negotiated, comprehensive settlement which must be both just and lasting. The Community's view of the principles according to which a settlement can be devised, starting from Security Council resolution 242 (1967), was set out in the Venice and Luxembourg Declarations.of 13 June and, 2 December 1980 respectively. The starting point must be the right to existence and security of all States in the area, including Israel, and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination. Acceptance of these principles by the parties concerned would remove a major obstacle to progress.\n65.\tThe members of the Community will pursue their efforts to promote a peace settlement energetically. Nevertheless, we must be clear about what the European Community can and cannot achieve. Ultimately it is for the parties to negotiate a lasting settlement themselves. In our view, a comprehensive settlement can only be negotiated if all the parties concerned, including the Palestinian people and the PLO, which will have to be associated with negotiations, accept the principles which we set out in the Venice Declaration and play their full part. One of Europe's main aims is to facilitate such negotiations, complementing the efforts of others towards the same objective. These thoughts underlay the Venice Declaration and the subsequent diplomatic efforts of the Community, notably the contacts made by Britain's predecessors in the presidency.\n66.\tIf a settlement is to be possible a climate of confidence must first be built up between the parties. Both sides must refrain from words or acts, particularly acts of violence as in recent months, which only complicate the search for a settlement The Community members are bound to repeat that the Israeli policy of settlements is contrary to international law and a major obstacle to progress towards peace. While pursuing its efforts in every other possible way, the European Community will work to encourage a climate of confidence as a contribution to a comprehensive settlement. The Community therefore welcomes all clear statements of interest in a peaceful settlement, including that made last month by Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia.\n67.\tI should like to put on record the European Community's sympathy for human suffering in Lebanon and our support for the efforts of the Lebanese Government to promote security and national reconciliation. We believe that the unity, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon can only be assured if all concerned uphold the authority of the legal Government and avoid all actions tending to undermine it. In this context, the Community values the work of the Quadripartite Committee of the Arab League. In south Lebanon, the ceasefire has been a valuable achievement and we hope it will be possible to reinforce it and build upon it. The Community members welcome and support all diplomatic efforts to this end. In .particular, they believe that UNIFIL should be enabled to carry out in full the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council and, we applaud the courageous and responsible work of the Force and express our sympathy for its losses; and I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Community's support for the valuable peacekeeping work of the United Nations in other areas.\n68.\tIf history and traditional and geographical proximity make the Middle East of particular concern to Europe, we are no less concerned about the other crises which strike at the very basis on which international peace and stability must rest.\n69.\tThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which constitutes a grave breach of the Charter, is one such crisis. It is an affront to international opinion that the Soviet military occupation there should continue. It has brought untold suffering for millions of Afghan people and untold problems for the countries to which large numbers of them have fled. It is to seek relief for that suffering and to contribute to international peace and stability that the European Council put forward its plan for a two-stage conference on Afghanistan.7\n70.\tThe Council's proposal for such a conference has received widespread support. It is therefore a great disappointment that the Soviet Union's response has so far been negative.\n71.\tIf the Soviet Union is sincere in its stated desire to withdraw its troops in the context of a political solution, then the proposal of the Council offers a way for negotiations to begin. If, however, the Soviet Union's only real concern is to obtain the acquiescence of the international community in its occupation of Afghanistan, and increased status and recognition for a regime which is rejected by the Afghan people and world opinion, then the outlook for any negotiations is grim indeed.\n72.\tThe members of the European Community support any efforts which will bring foreign intervention in Afghanistan to an end and allow that country to return to its traditional independence and nonaligned status. It is essential that the principles of the resolution of the Assembly should be observed. We support the efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and of the United Nations SecretaryGeneral to find a way to a peaceful settlement in accordance with those resolutions.\n73.\tAnother country which has been invaded and then occupied by a more powerful neighbor is Kampuchea. Thanks to the admirable efforts of the international emergency relief operation Jed by UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the physical condition of much of the population of Kampuchea has been transformed in the last two years. The European Community and its member States have played a major part in the financing of the relief.\n74.\tBut now that the immediate cause of suffering has been removed, it is time to turn to the political problems that still afflict that country. As with Afghanistan, the aim of the international community must be a comprehensive political settlement. The basis of that settlement should be an independent and neutral Kampuchea with\\\"' a genuinely representative Government. The position of the European Community was set out fully in the statement which, as President of the Community, I made to the International Conference on Kampuchea held here last July.\n75.\tThe Declaration on Kampuchea adopted by that Conference puts forward a reasonable and practical basis for a settlement of the Kampuchean problem. The Community endorsed that Declaration, which we believe would protect the legitimate rights of all concerned. We call on Viet Nam to agree to withdraw its forces and join the process of peaceful negotiations set in train at that meeting. The Kampucheans must be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination without disruption, intimidation or coercion.\n76.\tThe Community members are also very concerned at the continuing denial of the right to self-determination which lies at the root of the problem of Namibia. We deeply regret that the settlement leading to the independence of Zimbabwe has not been followed by further progress towards a speedy solution of the problems in that region.\n77.\tThe outcome of the pre-implementation meeting on Namibia at Geneva in January was a great disappointment. We saw no justification for South Africa's prevarication. We hope that the renewed efforts of the five Western States will succeed in finding an acceptable basis for pursuing negotiations on the implementation of the United Nations plan in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This provides the only possibility of a peaceful transition to internationally recognized independence for Namibia in accordance with a precise and rapid timetable.\n78.\tThe European Community has condemned the South African incursion into Angola, the violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity which it has involved, and the loss of life and suffering it has brought. We have demanded the immediate withdrawal of South African forces from Angola.\n79.\tWithin South Africa itself, the Community can find little cause for optimism. Virtually none of the expectations of worthwhile change in recent years have been fulfilled. Reforms promised by the South African Government, mostly still not implemented, do not deal with the fundamental problem of the political as well as the social and economic aspirations of blacks, coloreds and Asian South Africans.\n80.\tWithout an early move towards government by consent and the abandonment of the system of apartheid, which we all abhor, the trend in South Africa can only be one of accelerating conflict and violence. The European Community appeals with the utmost urgency to those in South Africa who can act decisively to face this reality, and to show the imagination, the boldness, and the leadership that are necessary to reach a political solution. In the meantime, the members of the Community continue to press South Africa to bring about peaceful change in that country.\n81.\tIn this catalog of unsolved problems I am glad to be able to mention one small chink of light. The European Community commends the efforts of the Secretary General on the question of Cyprus. Under his auspices the inter-communal talks have been established on a regular basis and conducted in a constructive manner. We have been pleased to note that there have been encouraging developments recently. We earnestly hope that there will be further progress towards a just and lasting solution to this grave problem.\n82.\tSimply to discuss specific crises does not give an adequate impression of the Community's approach to the problems facing us all. To be faithful to the principle of reconciliation we must work not just for the resolution of conflicts when they occur, but to lessen the tensions that give rise to them.\n83.\tEurope is fortunate to have been free from war for 36 years, but it is the area where the tension between East and West is felt most strongly. It contains the greatest concentration of military forces in the world. Community members recognize the need to lessen tension by maintaining a dialog between East and West. Efforts must be intensified to reduce the appallingly high level of armaments on both sides, while maintaining undiminished security for all States.\n84.\tMany of the hopes that we entertained for concrete measures of arms control and disarmament as we entered the 1970's have been cruelly disappointed. Nevertheless, the members of the European Community believe that there can be no substitute for painstaking negotiation resulting in agreements which tackle specific problems of arms control in a way which increases confidence and assures the security of all States.\n85.\tWe strongly support negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the mutual limitation of nuclear forces, and in particular the forthcoming negotiations on theater nuclear forces. Success will not be easy. Despite the difficulties, we believe that the objective should be to strike the balance at the lowest possible level. Nonproliferation of nuclear weapons remains a vital element for the security of us all.\n86.\tThe control of nuclear forces, in Europe as in the rest of the world, is only one side of the coin. It is equally important to reduce the size of conventional forces. In Europe the negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions continue to work towards that. The members of the European Community have also given their full support to the French proposal for a conference on disarmament in Europe* to negotiate confidence building measures of real military significance, which will be binding, verifiable, and applicable to the whole of Europe. We are seeking agreement on this important proposal at the Madrid review meeting on the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and we remain convinced that confidence-building measures which meet these criteria will make a real contribution to reducing the tensions and dangers of armed conflict. Such an approach could be useful in other regions of the world.\n87.\tThe European Community's second principle is cooperation. Here, duty and inclination point the same way. The Community is the world's biggest international trader. The handling of economic questions in harmony goes to the heart of the Community's interests.\n88.\tTo draw harmony from a variety of existing instruments is a challenge for the whole world community. The International Development Strategy, to take one example, is addressed to developed and developing countries alike, and recognizes their mutual interdependence. The greatly increased assistance provided by IMF and, especially, the World Bank, to take another, deserves acknowledgment and support, and we welcome both,\n89.\tThe current problems of the world economy accentuate the need for cooperation. They do not automatically make it easier. Adjustment to slower or negative economic growth, higher energy prices and weaker demand is taking time. Inflation, unemployment and interest rates remain high, and exchange markets volatile. The shoe pinches very hard for many countries, especially in the developing world. As was stressed at the European Council at its meeting last June, the Community is of the opinion that cooperation with developing countries and the intensification of international economic relations serve the interest of all concerned, and that they are necessary not only to strengthen the economies of the developing countries, but also to promote the recovery of the world economy.\n90.\tWe in the Community see no room for defeatism. I shall examine some issues which are getting our active attention.\n91.\tTrade is vital if the developing countries are to achieve sustained economic growth. This concept underpins the close and friendly ties we have with the developing countries, reflected in the Lome Convention 10 the generalized system of preferences and the Community's other arrangements. The Second Lome Convention\\\" has further improved the trade Advantages extended by the Community to the African, Caribbean and Pacific signatories. It has also made available substantially increased amounts of aid.\n92.\tMeanwhile, the Community stands firm for the maintenance of an open trading system and continued resistance to protectionism. GATT has served the international community well. The Community attaches importance to the full implementation of the Tokyo Round. It endorses the broad agreement within GATT that the contracting parties should envisage a ministerial meeting in the coming year to consider the overall condition of world trade.\n93.\tLet there be no doubt, equally, about the importance we attach to official development assistance. We welcome the intense diplomatic activity surrounding the problems of development. Despite real budgetary difficulties, we in the Community remain committed to the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product and have accepted the target of 0.15 per cent as aid for the least developed countries. The Community and its member States individually already provide development assistance worth over $12 billion a year. This is 39 per cent of all aid given to the developing countries, more than half the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development total and six or seven times that given by the countries of Eastern Europe. We see room for a matching effort here.\n94.\tThe Community was pleased to see the progress made at the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy at Nairobi last month. This was the beginning of a long but vital road. We were closely involved in the preparation of the Program of Action, and we welcome its adoption. The Conference will be seen as a milestone in the search for global solutions to energy problems that affect developed and developing countries alike.\n95.\tWe in the Community know full well that the problems of the world economy, which affect us all, create a particular hardship for developing countries, and especially the poorest among them. That is why we welcomed the successful conclusion of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held at Paris and will do our best to ensure that it is followed by positive and concrete results which will help the least developed countries to overcome their fundamental problems.\n96.\tNo discussion of the international economy would be complete without a tribute to the efforts of the outgoing President of the General Assembly to bring all sides together in order to launch a new round of global negotiations. Last June the European Council expressed the view that preparations for the new round of global negotiations should be completed as soon as possible and called on the summit conferences in Ottawa and Cancun to give a positive impetus to those preparations. The Community wants to see relations between developed and developing countries take a new and constructive course.\n97.\tIn this connection, we were happy to note that those countries attending the Economic Summit at Ottawa declared themselves ready to participate in a mutually acceptable process of global negotiations in circumstances offering the prospect of meaningful progress. We welcome the recognition at the Ottawa summit of the importance of making increased resources available for the purposes of accelerated food production and food security in the developing world.\n98.\tThe Cancun summit will provide an exceptional opportunity, and we hope that the exchanges there will be imaginative and spontaneous. A two day summit cannot achieve miracles, but the discussion could mark an important step forward in mutual understanding and provide a political impetus in the NorthSouth dialog. The atmosphere of the preparatory meeting for Cancun was an encouraging augury.\n99.\tThe third principle which governs the European Community's activities on the international stage is the defense of human rights. The Community is a group of States founded on a commitment to democratic principles. Our citizens participate in a political system which guarantees and respects the fundamental freedoms of the individual. Inevitably, therefore, the defense of human rights is a matter of concern to them.\n100.\tWe stand for the promotion and protection of all categories of human rights: civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural. We especially condemn cases of torture, detention without trial or arbitrary execution. We think it deplorable that there should still be situations where people disappear without trace, or where they are persecuted on grounds of race or religion, or for defending human rights.\n101.\tIt is now accepted that these and other violations of human rights are a subject of proper and necessary concern for discussion at the United Nations. As States Members of the United Nations we all have the obligation to promote the protection of human rights in our own countries and in the international community as a whole. We shall continue to speak out against violations of human rights in appropriate United Nations forums and also at the Madrid review meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n102.\tToo often in the past the United Nations has been unable or has failed for reasons of political expediency to respond to flagrant violations of human rights. This undermines the credibility of the United Nations. We must not overlook such violations of human rights no matter where they occur. Rather, we should work together to protect the victims and to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to promote respect for human rights.\n103.\tI hope that I have demonstrated that the European Community is a force for peaceful progress in a turbulent and troubled world. We threaten the security of no one. We have no ideology or system that we wish to impose on those of other cultures and traditions. We respect the right of all nations to self-determination and freedom from foreign interference, and we wish to help them in their pursuit of stable economic growth. It is our conviction that among the vast majority of the members of the Assembly there is an enormous potential for common understanding and cooperation which could only be for the benefit of all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "I am particularly pleased to convey to you, Sir, my delegation's warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Our satisfaction is all the greater since, quite naturally, you were destined, by reason of your exceptional diplomatic background, to assume this lofty responsibility. The international community has thus honored a remarkable career that has been closely linked to the life and activities of the United Nations for over a quarter century.\n134.\tThe prestige of your country, Iraq, with which Guinea-Bissau has fraternal relations of friendship and cooperation, has thus been further enhanced, and it extends to all member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the non-aligned movement. My delegation will lend you its friendly co-operation throughout this particularly important thirty-sixth session.\n135.\tMr. President, you succeed a distinguished personality known for his devotion, competence and initiative throughout the work of a heavily charged and trying session and between that session and this one. Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar deserves our congratulations and warmest thanks for the excellent results attained by the thirty-fifth session. We are particularly grateful for his efforts to reactivate the global negotiations.\n\n136.\tIt is a great pleasure for me to extend greetings to the Secretary-General to whom I convey my Government's tribute for his contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security.\n137.\tThe admission of two new Member States to the United Nations is a source of particular satisfaction to my delegation. Aware, as we are, of the hard trials which preceded that important event in Vanuatu and' Belize, we warmly welcome the representatives of those two countries and assure them of our determination to develop strong bonds of frank, friendly and mutually beneficial co-operation with them.\n138.\tIn response to an increasingly pressing need for world-wide agreement, leaders and politicians of most of the countries of the globe come together in this forum every year to analyze the international situation. This phenomenon, although traditional, is not a ritual: it is the logical outcome of our will to seek, together, the ways and means likely to ensure us of peace and happiness. For the radical changes that have taken place in the world thanks to the enormous progress made in the fields of science and technology have confirmed the interdependence of nations and forged the common destiny of mankind.\n139.\tToday the world belongs to all its inhabitants. Its progress or its destruction can no longer escape the rule of participation, but depends on the individual and collective efforts of our Governments. Each one of us bears a share of the responsibility for building our common edifice. Peace in the world cannot be brought about by a single nation, however powerful it may be, nor can it be the fragile result o-2 a transitory compromise among major Powers. If peace in the world is to be lasting and is to respond to the aspirations of our peoples, it must be forged by the international community as a whole and must be based on its need for progress.\n140.\tThe liberation struggle of oppressed peoples is founded on every human being's right to freedom. It is an inalienable and unique right; it is the same right for all people throughout the world. It is a sacred right which must be respected and defended by all available means, wherever it may be ignored or flouted.\n141.\tOn the basis of that principle, and aware of its own collective responsibility, the international community lends its total support to the cause of peoples fighting for their independence. This solidarity was once again expressed, in support of freedom fighters, at the eighth emergency special session, devoted to the question of Namibia.\n142.\tInternational public opinion has recognized the urgent need to put an end to the sufferings imposed by the racist apartheid regime on the African people of southern Africa. An independent and non-aligned Namibia would be an invaluable contribution to the strengthening of international peace and security, because each and every one of us is aware of the gravity of the situation obtaining in that region.\n143.\tSouth Africa's repeated acts of aggression against the front-line States particularly against the People's Republic of Angola demonstrate the extent to which the racist apartheid regime mocks the norms of international law and the decisions of the United Nations. The occupation of southern Angola, and the well-known quantities and types of military equipment, bear eloquent witness to the bellicose and dangerous nature of the Pretoria racist regime. The hundreds of victims of the savage bombings by the South African Air Force, and the vast extent of the material damage to the Angolan economy, are macabre pieces of evidence of Pretoria's true designs.\n144.\tDisdain for the human person can only evoke abhorrence and condemnation. The international community and the Governments which represent it cannot tolerate such acts, which seriously jeopardize international peace and security. Our need for peace in order to ensure mankind's survival and our people's prosperity calls for action. But our action should not be inspired by selfish interests. To be effective, it must be based on our common destiny and start with acknowledgment of the need for all people on earth to pool their efforts so as to shoulder fully their collective responsibility for saving the world from destruction.\n145.\tSouth Africa cannot alone defy the rest of the international community. It persists in its racist policy of apartheid, domination and aggression because of the support it receives from certain countries. True, that support most frequently takes the form of economic and military co-operation, but there can be no doubt that it constitutes moral and political support for the practitioners of apartheid, who derive sure encouragement from it for the perpetuation of their domination.\n146.\tThe independence of Namibia cannot be deferred sine die without there being unforeseeable consequences, to say the least, for the entire community of nations.\n147.\tThe contact group continues to be responsible for the strict implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which those Members themselves sponsored, and which provide the only real basis for a swift and peaceful settlement of the Namibian problem. The contact group must go beyond the stage of ambiguous behavior and laconic communiques and devote itself with determination to the quest for a true and definitive solution to the problem. The five States must bring to bear their power of economic, political and moral coercion on the Government of Pretoria to prevail upon it to come to terms with the international community and with the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. SWAPO, the only legitimate representative of the Namibian people, has already expressed its readiness and preference for a peaceful settlement of the conflict.\n148.\tSince the problem of Namibia is a problem of decolonization there is only one solution: the accession to independence of the Namibian people and the exercise of its inalienable right to decide its own fate. Such independence is inevitable; contemporary history confirms this. What is important at present is to preserve the chance of brotherly coexistence among all the components of the Namibian population so that, rich in ethnic and cultural diversity, the Namibian people may, in a climate of peace and national harmony, in the near future achieve rapid and harmonious development.\n149.\tThe racist regime of apartheid will not be able to oppose indefinitely the struggle of the South African people and its determination to restore justice and impose respect for the human condition. To judge by the recent events in that country and the scope of the struggle being courageously waged by the South African patriots under the banner of the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress, its days are limited.\n150.\tIt is essential for the international community to play an effective part in the establishment of a climate of peace in that part of the African continent by stepping up its aid to the African patriots and increasing its pressure on Pretoria in order to force that apartheid regime to recognize and respect the basic rights of every South African citizen. ,\n151.\tIt is also necessary for the United Nations to decide during this session to grant special emergency aid to the People's Republic of Angola. That aid should be commensurate with the damage done and the suffering so courageously borne by the people of Angola, and should be given in the name of the United Nations and in keeping with the obligation of the international community as a whole to contribute to the cause of the independence of Namibia.\n152.\tNeedless to say, the countries that have close relations with the Republic of South Africa have an undeniable moral obligation to contribute to that international effort, thus acting pursuant to the relevant decisions and resolutions of the United Nations.\n153.\tMy Government welcomes the results achieved by the OAU at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, held last June at Nairobi, with regard to the question of Western Sahara.\n154.\tAcceptance by the Moroccan Government of organizing a referendum in Western Sahara no doubt constitutes a decisive step towards the just and definitive solution of the problem. The consensus reached by Africa, with the direct participation of all the interested parties, although all aspects of the question were not defined in detail shows the unanimous will of the African States to contribute together to a peaceful settlement of the conflict. We hope that the referendum will enable the Sahraoui people to determine their future and to satisfy their legitimate aspirations to independence. My country, aware of the difficulties inherent in the complex nature of such a process, will spare no effort to contribute in a constructive spirit to its successful outcome.\n155.\tThe International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa, which was held last April at Geneva, made the international public aware of the serious problem which affects the existence of 5 million human beings.\n156.\tAs victims of natural disasters of all types, or more frequently of degrading economic and political situations, African refugees flee from their homes of origin to escape poverty and death. We must say here that in order to face the situation and eliminate that evil, African countries themselves must provide the necessary political effort to put an end to the dispersal and weakening of their human potential. The example of the war in Chad confirms that need. Of course, the aid of the international community is essential in order to alleviate the sufferings of those millions of human beings. However, the upsurge of solidarity which was evidenced in Geneva and which we hope will become even stronger may prove meaningless unless an effective solution to the problem of refugees is found. Last June at Nairobi the OAU adopted an African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, and respect for and strict implementation of that charter will contribute greatly to the solution of the problem.\n157.\tTurning now to the eastern part of the African continent, we must express our concern over the growing tendency to install foreign bases in the region and the in-creasing deployment of an entire armada in the Indian Ocean, which seriously threatens peace and security in that region. The situation is even more threatening because the will of the international community to make the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace has not been carried out, for reasons that are well known to all and which we deplore. The decision of the United Nations to convene a conference on that question should be implemented as soon as possible in order to provide a positive response to the aspirations to peace and security of the riparian States of the Indian Ocean and of the rest of the world.\n158.\tIt is with the same wish to see the countries of the region devote themselves legitimately to the consolidation of their unity and their development that has led us to hope that the negotiations that have begun between the Comorian and French Governments will lead to the swift reintegration of the Island of Mayotte in the rest of the Comoros. In our view, France's retrocession of the Malagasy Islands in the Indian Ocean should obey the same logic and satisfy the same principle of respect for the territorial integrity of States.\n159.\tFor several years now we have been denouncing with the same vigor and condemning with the same force the violation of the right of peoples in the Middle East. Israel's persistent denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people continues to whip up tension in the region and is giving a world-wide dimension to the conflict.\n160.\tGuinea-Bissau, which has always adhered to the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, vigorously condemns Israel's aggressive and annexationist policy. Despite the continuous efforts of the United Nations to uphold legality and international norms governing normal relations among States, the solution of this serious conflict continues to elude us. Israel continues to defy the international community by rejecting with the greatest arrogance all of its (l60^0118 ^ recommendations. Its intransigence, as everyone knows, is based on its alliances with certain Western Powers which lend it the political, economic, military and even moral support that is indispensable to its policy of aggression. The contempt expressed by certain Governments towards peoples Whose culture is different from their own finds its most abject expression in this infamous conspiracy against human freedom.\n161.\tThe very nature of the question of Palestine, which is the struggle of a people for its most legitimate rights, is distorted and reduced to the mere matter of a refugee problem. Such an overturning of historical facts, which are nevertheless unimpeachable, is being shamefully offered to us today in the utterly absurd form of so-called negotiations on the internal autonomy of the Palestinians. The international community, having been alerted by a whole series of earlier maneuvers and aware of the deception involved, must, after the well-known and inevitable failure of the partial accords, demonstrate with even greater vigor its disagreement, and it must condemn this plot.\n162.\tThe free exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to self-determination and to the creation of an independent State continues to be the sine qua non of any just and final settlement of the problem. The question of Palestine, representing as it does the heart of the problem of the Middle East, as has been stated many times, must form the basis of any peace initiative which, in order to be viable and to be acceptable to the community of nations, must consider that problem in all its aspects.\n163.\tFirst and foremost, Israel must withdraw unconditionally from all th Arab territories occupied since 1967 and must recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including the right to form their own State.\n164.\tIsrael must recognize the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States in the region.\n165.\tIsrael must renounce its policy of aggression and its expansionist aims, just as it must put an end to its murderous attacks against Lebanon. It is obvious that the Israeli bombings are designed to disrupt the Lebanese Stage and to destroy its national unity. This further act committed by Israel with impunity shows the seriousness of the situation with even greater clarity and places the responsibility of the United Nations with regard to this problem in its true context. Guinea-Bissau strongly condemns the flagrant violations of the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon and repeats to the brother people of Lebanon its unswerving solidarity\n166.\tAnother example of the escalation of Israel's aggressive policy is the bombing of the Iraqi nuclear installation at Tamuz. The entire world has condemned the criminal nature of that act, which was designed solely to halt Iraq's technological development.\n167.\tThe world cannot remain idle in the face of the groundless decision of the Israeli authorities to make Jerusalem the capital of the Hebrew State. The method used, it is true, stems from the same arrogant and aggressive Israeli policy. However, such contempt for the faith of millions of believers will inevitably aggravate the situation in the region and give rise to consequences that are, to say the least, unforeseeable.\n168.\tIsraeli has neither the right nor the strength to shatter the spiritual longings of millions, who will take up this new challenge in order to preserve for the Holy City of Jerusalem its sacred and indestructible nature as the cradle of the three major monotheistic religions.\n169.\tI cannot conclude these remarks on the situation in the Middle East without mentioning the painful conflict between Iraq and Iran. Guinea-Bissau's membership, at the side of those two brother countries, in the Organization of the Islamic Conference and in the non-aligned movement explains, the great concern we feel at the continuance of that fratricidal war, Our bitterness is even greater since the praiseworthy efforts undertaken by the Mediation Committee of the non-aligned movement and the Goodwill Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference have not achieved the expected results. We hope, however, that our Iraqi and Iranian brothers will be able, with the contribution of all, to transcend their differences and re-establish friendly and lasting relations between their peoples.\n170.\tIn South-East Asia, the situation remains unchanged, despite the peace efforts undertaken by the international community. With regard to Kampuchea, we continue to believe that any action by the United Nations must be directed towards the exclusive defense of the higher interests of the Kampuchean people and must respect their right to settle their own affairs themselves.\n171.\tThis same approach in international relations applies also to the situation in Afghanistan, in Latin America and in the Caribbean.\n172.\tWe note that, in East Timor, in spite of the repeated appeals and relevant decisions of the United Nations, the Government of Indonesia is persisting in its policy of occupation of that country. The international community is aware of the fact that the presence of foreign forces in East Timor runs counter to the norms of international law and the right of peoples to self-determination. The session of the Permanent People's Tribunal on the question of East Timor which was held at Lisbon from 19 to 21 June of this year strongly confirmed the inadmissibility, de facto and de jure, of such action [see At36/448, annex].\n173.\tIt is up to the international community, as we have said on many occasions, to act in accordance with justice and to assist the FRETELIN4 patriots to restore their people's legitimate right to self-determination, The Portuguese Government, as the former colonial Power, must pursue its efforts in that regard and implement its will to contribute to the solution of the problem of East Timor.\n174.\tThe desire of the people of Korea for reunification deserves the attention and total support of the international community. Guinea-Bissau highly values the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strengthen the unity of the Korean nation and strongly favors the signature of a peace treaty which would finally put an end to the presence of foreign troops in\nKorea and to any outside interference. There is no doubt that the United Nations should base itself on the relevant decisions of the countries in the non-aligned movement to help the Korean people to see its dream come true and to attain its desire to live in unity and peace.\n175.\tRegarding the question of Cyprus, we must note with great regret that the past year has not brought the progress we had hoped for. The people of Cyprus continues to struggle courageously for respect for its independence, territorial integrity and unity. We think that the talks between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots must be based on these principles, which, with the principle of non-alignment, constitute the only guarantee of peace and stability for the two communities. My delegation hopes that negotiations will be pursued in a constructive spirit.\n176.\tThe report of the Secretary-General reminds us once again of the crucial problem of disarmament, in all its gravity. I will not expatiate on this matter, which has been the subject of several publications by the United Nations and various specialized agencies.\n177.\tThe colossal expenditures on military arsenals are so distressing that they remain the primary concern of humanity. Man cannot permit his self-destruction. He must react to the dangers of a possible apocalypse. It is in all our interests to change these trends and to contribute to the prosperity of mankind rather than to its destruction.\n178.\tMan, in his daily struggle for a better future, must likewise take account of the need to preserve the balance of nature. The decision of the OAU Council of Ministers to propose to the General Assembly the adoption of a World Charter on Nature [see AI36I534, annex I, resolution CM/Res. 852 (XXXVIIj] must be studied with all the requisite care.\n179.\tThe realization of the aspiration of the majority of the members of the international community to establish a new international economic order is undoubtedly one of the vital necessities of our time. The establishment of a new international economic order would constitute a fundamental response to the need for justice and equity for all the peoples of our world. The experience of recent years shows us how difficult this goal is to achieve. Indeed, since the special sessions in 1974 and 1975, at which the Assembly proclaimed the urgent need of such an order, and the failure of the first two United Nations Development Decades, the North-South dialog that we wished to establish has led merely to the impasse which the international community is now facing. Nevertheless, this difficulty is not insuperable and resignation is certainly not appropriate, especially on the part of countries which continue to be the prime victims of the present social and economic order. That is why we wish to join our voice to the voices of other peoples to express the hope that this new decade will really be one in which the new international economic order will be established, since the survival not only of the poor majority of the international community but also of the whole of humanity depends on it.\n180.\tThe facts clearly show that it is useless to attack ^partially and in an isolated manner the evils that affect\nrelations among nations. Indeed, substantial structural changes are needed. Happily, the initiatives that have been taken recently among the countries of the third world have given proof of their clear awareness of this need.\n181.\tThe implementation of measures to establish a new international economic order necessitates the establishment of a new system of institutions which would enable a qualitative change to be made in the present world economic structures, particularly in the trade, monetary and financial fields. The countries of the South have quite rightly remained inflexible in regard to this need.\n182.\tThe need to eliminate the structural causes of inequality is made clear in the documents adopted at the end of the most recent international meetings, in particular the High-Level Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries that was held at Caracas. This action is all the more indispensable in that it is the only thing capable of bringing about a complete change in the existing order and opening the way to new economic prospects.\n183.\tFacts show ever more clearly that because of the disparities in the present international economic order the world is on the brink of an abyss, and a revolution is necessary to change this situation. Only strong political determination based on the imperative needs of justice, equity and respect for man can lead to the solution that humanity is anxiously awaiting.\n184.\tthe promotion of individual and collective self-reliance in developing countries can be regarded as a reliable means of attaining the main goals of the new international economic order. In Africa, significant progress has been made towards developing regional co-operation, as is borne out, for example, by the establishment of joint economic institutions, such as the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS].\n185.\tThe United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held recently at Nairobi, has created new hopes for the developing countries in particular for the African countries which do not possess energy resources. If we use the opportunities for co-operation in this field, we shall undoubtedly be able to overcome the major problems in the field of energy, and thus help to make the non-oil-producing countries less dependent on outside sources.\n186.\tThe Republic- of Guinea-Bissau, which is among the 31 least developed countries, continues to be confronted with great economic difficulties. We think that in speaking on behalf of Guinea-Bissau we are also voicing the point of view of other members of this group, for the simple reason that, despite the existence of certain local variations, problems are by and large the same.\n187.\tFor us, the fact that our country has been put on the list of the least developed countries is very Important. Indeed, apart from the deficiencies and the multiple structural problems we inherited from five centuries of colonial domination, the seven years which have just passed since our accession to independence in 1974 have shown us that the international situation and the present economic order discourage any initiatives which would lead to the solution of the problems posed by development.\n188.\tThe dislocation of the traditional sector resulting from the process of colonial exploitation and the impossibility for the modern economic sector to absorb workers from rural areas have given rise to serious problems, such as unemployment and under-employment, and have made difficult the participation of rural workers in a comprehensive development process within an integrated national economy.\n189.\tAgricultural production, constantly decreasing because of desertification in the Sudano-Sahelian region, is far below the level required for us to be self-sufficient in food.\n190.\tOur determination to support any measures aimed at bringing about a complete change in international economic relations is based on fundamental social and economic considerations. That is why we welcome the results achieved at recent international meetings on economic problems and we hope that adoption of the Substantial New program of Action by the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which was held in Paris, will initiate a solution to the many problems confronting these countries. Increasing international assistance to the least developed countries is essential.\n191.\tWhile we are aware that the Cancun Meeting is not a forum for negotiations, we hope that a genuine will to contribute positively to the establishment of a new inter-national economic order will prevail during this highly important meeting, thanks to the new concept of the interdependence of peoples and of international relations.\n192.\tThe draft convention on the law of the sea is an important step forward in the development of international law. Unfortunately, the hopes aroused by the possible adoption, at long last, of rules governing the sea have not been met because of the obstruction encountered at the last session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and in spite of the existence of a consensus which had been reached after more than seven years of difficult negotiations. However, we hope that the decision taken at Geneva to conclude the convention at the next session, scheduled to be held in New York, will be acted upon, thus allowing us to proceed to the signing of the convention in September 1982 at Caracas.\n193.\tThe proclamation by the international community of 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons is obvious proof of the abiding concern of the great family of the United Nations to find just and adequate solutions to all problems affecting mankind. My country, which is emerging from a long war, is making great efforts not only in the sphere of national reconstruction, which has been particularly affected by the international economic crisis, but also in the reintegration of the disabled into the socio-economic development process.\n194.\tThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau welcomes this important decision, which is of great help in making the international public aware of the special situation of disabled persons and of the need to help them play a full role in society.\n195.\tThe problems of concern to the international community are numerous and complex. That is why it is evermore necessary for us to undertake joint action aimed at establishing a more just and more equitable world and at strengthening international peace and solidarity.\n196.\tAt a time when we are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the creation of the non-aligned movement, which is making a positive contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security, it is an honor for me to pay a resounding tribute to the founding fathers of our movement.\n197.\tMy country, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, reiterates its total support for the principles of non-alignment and expresses once more its wish to establish and strengthen ties of friendship and co-operation with all countries, as well as its resolve to contribute tirelessly to the establishment of a climate of peace and progress for all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I should also like to take this opportunity to express warm congratulations to the people of Belize, who have attained independence after a long period of efforts, and to extend a cordial welcome to the Republic of Vanuatu, which has been admitted to membership in the United Nations.\n127.\tIn the past year, the people of various countries have waged effective struggles against imperialism, hegemonism, colonialism and racism and have increased their mutual support and assistance, thus contributing significantly to the maintenance of world peace. However, the world is still fraught with tension and turbulence. While old issues remain unsettled, new problems keep cropping up. Outrageous violations of the norms of international relations have not been stopped and the third world countries have been the major victims. The world is still faced with the danger of war.\n128.\tWe cannot ignore the fact that the Soviet Union is trying hard to consolidate and increase its military strength and is stepping up its global deployment for war. On the one hand, it continues to occupy foreign territories and massacre the local inhabitants by the use of force and to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries by the threat of force. On the other hand, it has been paving the way for further expansions by carrying out political and economic infiltrations and stirring up troubles wherever possible. AN this shows that the Soviet Union has not given up its bid for world hegemony and that the corollary strategy of a southward drive remains unchanged.\n129.\tHowever, because of repeated setbacks and its own vulnerabilities, the Soviet Union, while adhering to a policy of aggression and expansion, has increasingly resorted to political tricks. It has launched a new peace offensive by putting forward so-called proposals regarding disarmament, political solutions and so on in order to confuse public opinion, to disguise its own hegemonism and to deceive or lull the people of the world. In these circumstances, it would be contrary to the objective realities of the international scene to suggest that the Soviet Union is harmless and on the defensive or that its deep predicament is forcing it to consider a retreat. Aggression and expansion by Soviet hegemonism continue to be the major threat to world peace. Hence, the struggle against hegemonism remains the primary task for the maintenance of world peace.\n130.\tThe events in Afghanistan and Kampuchea major instances  which threaten the peace and security of the world and grossly violate the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international relations.\n131.\tThe Soviet armed invasion of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea with Soviet support are both aimed at totally subjugating and occupying a neighboring country by force. If such lawlessness is not firmly stored, but instead accepted as a fait accompli, it will only  the appetite of the aggressors and convince them the they can go on practicing the law of the jungle unimpeded In that case, what would be left of justice and the code of conduct for the international community? How, then, can there be any security for the States Members of the United Nations, particularly the weaker third world countries?\n132.\tThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and its support for the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea are not only aimed at subjugating the two countries, but also at using them as springboards for further expansion, so as to close the ring around the oil-rich region of the Middle East, push towards the Strait of Malacca and increase the threat to the surrounding countries and to the peace and security of the rest of the world. Many mo. countries will corns to grief if the aggression against Afghanistan and Kampuchea is not checked and if the Soviet Union is allowed to press forward with its strategy of a southward drive.\n133.\tMeanwhile, as the Soviet Union is going ahead steadily with its global strategic deployment, the risk of war will increase. Only by firmly putting an end to the aggression against Afghanistan and Kampuchea will it be possible to salvage the independence of these two nations, and to blunt or check the momentum of the Soviet Union's southward drive, curb its expansion in other parts of the world and upset its global strategic plan. The heroic struggles in the past three years of the Kampuchean people under the leadership of the Government of democratic Kampuchea and the widespread resistance movement of the Afghan people have made brilliant contributions not only to the defense of their own independence and sovereignty but also to the maintenance of world peace and the security of all countries.\n134.\tIt is obvious that Afghanistan and Kampuchea are the priority issues in the overall world situation and that a fair and reasonable settlement can only be achieved by waging unremitting struggles. We trust that all justice upholding and peace-loving countries and peoples will continue to be deeply concerned with these issues and will strengthen their fighting will in view of the protracted nature of the struggle.\n135.\tIt is understandable that quite a few countries have called for a political settlement of the Afghan and Kampuchean issues. But the question is: on what principles should the political settlement be based? The resolutions on Afghanistan and Kampuchea adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, the declarations adopted by the Third Islamic Conference, held last January, by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non Aligned Countries, held last February, and by the International Conference on Kampuchea, last July, have all stressed that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from both countries and that any settlement of these issues must be based on the principles of respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all States and the right of all peoples to determine their own destiny free from any foreign interference.\n136.\tChina is in favor of such a political settlement and is ready to work with other Member States towards this end. However, the withdrawal of all foreign troops is the primary condition for any political settlement. The Soviet Union and Viet Nam backed by the Soviet Union adamantly refuse to leave Afghanistan and Kampuchea, respectively. This is the basic reason why the Afghan and Kampuchean issues have remained unresolved till now. Under these circumstances, the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples are bound to carry on their sacred war in defense of their own countries. Lately, the patriotic forces of both countries have been closing their ranks in order to fight more effectively against the aggressors. For its part, the international community is duty bound to continue to support and assist in various ways the just struggles of the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples.\n137.\tOnly when the aggressors have suffered heavier and heavier blows on the battlefield and have been subjected to mounting pressure from the international community will they be forced to consider pulling out their troops. Therefore, to increase the pressure on the aggressors from all sides is precisely the way towards creating conditions for a political settlement of the Afghan and Kampuchean issues. Conversely, any attempt to weaken or break up the armed struggle against aggression or to strike a deal at the expense of the victimized peoples in exchange for concessions from the aggressors would only embolden the hegemonists and hurt the chance of a genuine settlement.\n138.\tThe recent proposals offered by the Soviet Union and Viet Nam for settling the Afghan and Kampuchean questions are all based on the acceptance of the fait accompli created by their armed aggression. A compromise on such a basis' would be tantamount to accepting a new Munich agreement by allowing the aggressors to gain easily at the negotiating table what they have failed to get on the battlefield. That is obviously impermissible. The\nChinese Government maintains that all foreign troops must be withdrawn from Afghanistan and Kampuchea immediately and unconditionally, that these two countries must be restored to their independent and nonaligned status, and that the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples must be free to choose their own political systems and governments.\n139.\tThe Chinese Government reiterates its position that following the settlement of the Afghan and Kampuchean questions in accordance with the aforementioned principles, the countries concerned should join in an international guarantee that there shall be no interference whatsoever in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and Kampuchea and that their territory shall not be occupied or used for encroachment on the independence and sovereignty of other countries in either region. We hope that the General Assembly will adhere to the principles set forth in the resolutions adopted at its previous sessions and make renewed efforts towards a settlement of the Afghan and Kampuchean issues.\n140.\tIn the past year the situation in the Middle East, rather than improving, has become more tense. Israel is still clinging obstinately to an expansionist position. It has not only continued to obstruct a reasonable settlement of the Middle East question, but has become more reckless by committing fresh atrocities against the Arab countries and peoples in violation of the Charter and the norms of international relations. It flagrantly raided Iraq's nuclear reactor, repeatedly invaded Lebanon and frequently bombed Palestinian refugee camps in open defiance of the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations. Israel's lawlessness is intolerable and must be stopped. The Chinese Government and people sternly condemn these Israeli acts of aggression and firmly support the just struggles of the Arab people. We maintain that Israel must withdraw from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem; that the Palestinian people must regain their national rights, including the right to return to their homeland and the right to self-determination and establishment of a state; that the PLO, as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, is entitled to participate on an equal footing in a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question; and that all countries in the Middle East have the right to independence and existence. We are pleased to note that many Arab countries, the European Community and others, have been making positive efforts to bring about a settlement of the Middle East question. Our attitude is that we welcome all initiatives that are conducive to a comprehensive and just settlement of the Middle East question and to peace and stability in the region.\n141.\tIn southern Africa, the white racist regime is becoming more and more unbridled in trampling upon the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international relations. Not only does it continue to occupy Namibia illegally in defiance of United Nations resolutions and to strengthen the system of apartheid in South Africa, but it has launched repeated armed attacks against the front line States. Not long ago it even carried out a large-scale invasion of Angola. These outrages constitute a flagrant provocation to the African people and to the people of the entire world. In our view, Namibia should attain genuine national independence immediately on the basis of territorial integrity and national unity and in conformity with the aspirations of the Namibian people and the relevant United\\\" Nations resolutions; the system of apartheid in South Africa must be completely abolished; and the international community should apply, without reservation, comprehensive sanctions against South Africa. We firmly support the solemn resolution adopted at the emergency special session on the question of Namibia [iES8/2]. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must be fully implemented without further delay.\n142.\tThe Middle East and southern Africa are two important regions rich in strategic resources. The Soviet Union has always regarded them as important targets for its aggression and expansion. Masquerading as a supporter of national liberation movements, it has long since infiltrated these regions in an attempt to expand its influence there. The crimes committed by Israel and South Africa have not only brought untold sufferings to the countries and peoples of those regions, but have also provided the hegemonists with more opportunities and pretexts for infiltration, thereby posing a greater threat to peace in the Middle East, southern Africa and the rest of the world.\n143.\tIt must be pointed out that the arrogance and defiance of Israel and South Africa are attributable, in large measure, to United Stales support and protection. The United States has repeatedly expressed its willingness to improve its relations with the third-world countries and to join them in safeguarding world peace. But what is the sense of expressing such sentiments when Israel and South Africa are being condoned and given support instead of being denounced for their flagrant breaches of the norms of international relations? This only antagonizes the hundreds of millions of Arab and African peoples and a large number of third-world countries.\n144.\tThe situation in the Caribbean region merits our attention. The peoples in some of the countries there have long been subjected to imperialist and colonialist exploitation and oppression and unbearable domestic, political and economic conditions. It is their inalienable right to uphold their national independence and State sovereignty, develop their national economy and carry out democratic reforms. This should be recognized in the first place. On the other hand, it must be noted that another superPower and its proxies have been meddling in the internal affairs of those countries and trying hard to infiltrate the region under the guise of supporting the progressive movements. In our opinion, the people of the region should be left alone to solve their own problems. We are opposed to all outside interferences no matter where they come from.\n145.\tThe situation in NorthEast Asia is also not tranquil. The United States has thus far failed to withdraw its troops from South Korea. The peaceful reunification of Korea continues to meet with obstructions from the authorities in South Korea. In October 1980, President Kim II Sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a new formula for the establishment of a Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, which would incorporate both North and South Korea. This reflects the fervent hope of the broad masses of the Korean people for the reunification of their fatherland and provides a practical way for its realization. We maintain that resolution 3390 ft (XXX) on the question of Korea, sponsored by 43 countries and adopted by the General Assembly at its thirtieth session, should be implemented expeditiously so as to create. favorable conditions for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\n145. Over the past year, the world has not only witnessed a series of major political events, but has also been faced with serious economic problems. The economic conditions of many developing countries have further deteriorated and the economic contradictions between the North and South have become more acute. Faced with worsening terms of trade, the developing countries are plagued with greater deficits in their international balance of payments and heavier burdens of foreign debts. They basically remain powerless in international economic relations. Certain developed countries are clinging to the old international economic order and trying to shift the consequences of the economic crises onto others, thus creating greater obstacles for the developing countries to build independent economies and making it more difficult for them to achieve the objectives of their, development strategies.\n147.\tThe efforts of the developing countries to achieve economic independence after winning political independence represent an irresistible trend of our time. The major developed countries, however, refuse to go along with this trend by changing their unequal and unfair relationship with the developing countries. This is the root cause for the ever sharpening economic contradictions between the North and South.\n148.\tThe economies of nations are closely interrelated. The developed countries are increasingly dependent on the developing countries for their economic growth. From the longterm point of view, the prolonged impoverishment of the latter will not be in the economic interests of the former. A number of developed countries have come to realize that their own economic \\\"stagflation\\\" may be alleviated as a result of the economic growth of the developing countries. We are of the view that the principle of equality and mutual benefit, which is the norm of international relations, should also apply to the economic field.\n149.\tMoreover, one must not lose sight of the fact that the economic difficulties of the developing countries and the resultant domestic political turmoil, as well as the worsening NorthSouth contradictions, will provide the hegemonists with opportunities to stir up troubles. To support the developing countries in building their independent economies and to promote appropriate reforms in the international economic order so as to establish step by step a new international economic order is therefore not a purely economic matter but a vital political question that affects the maintenance of world peace and stability.\n150.\tIt is pure hope that the major developed countries, proceeding from the overall situation of the world, will give serious consideration to the legitimate desires and demands of the developing countries, promptly come to an agreement at the current session or at the forthcoming Cancun summit to launch the global negotiations, and take practical and feasible measures to meet the urgent needs of the developing countries and improve North South relations.\n151.\tThe political and economic situation of the world today is grim indeed. The maintenance of peace is the common aspiration of the people of the world. However, We have to struggle for peace; we cannot beg for it. To\ndefend world peace it is imperative to oppose hegemonism. To this end, the peoples of all countries should unite and coordinate their actions, taking into account their respective situations. In order to achieve greater unity against hegemonism it is necessary for all parties to respect each other's sovereign rights and interests and to treat each other as equals. On the eve of the Second , World War certain countries failed to discern in time the source of the threat and failed to unite effectively to oppose it. The people of the world ended up paying a heavy price and the world learned a bitter lesson.\n152: China has consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace. Having suffered enormously from foreign aggressions and wars in the past, the Chinese people know only too well how precious peace is. Today, as the Chinese people are engaged in building China into a modernized socialist country, they need all the more a lasting peaceful international environment. However; in pursuing the policy of safeguarding world peace and opposing hegemonism, China is motivated not simply by its own interests, but also takes into account the interests of the people of the whole world.\n153.\tChina is a developing socialist country; it belongs and will always belong to the third world. China is ready to work together with other third-world countries as well as all countries that uphold justice and love peace and to contribute all it can to the defense of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international relations and to the cause of opposing hegemonism and maintaining world peace.\n"

        "file_text": " Permit me, Sir, before I begin my statement to express the profound sorrow that my country feels over the death of President Sadat, a death which is a cause for grief among all peace-loving nations.\n2.\tMr. President, in you I greet one whose intellectual qualifications are worthy of the presidency of the Assembly, and I welcome the fact that your election reflects a general tribute to the image of a centuries-old country which, in our day, maintains a cordial friendship with Latin America.\n3.\tEcuador extends a friendly welcome to the new Members of the United Nations and offers them its support in achieving their goals and overcoming their problems.\n4.\tThe principles that govern international life are well known and my Government fully respects them. Those principles are contained in the Charter of the United Nations, or which, being fully in accord with its aims, require reinforcement through acts of conduct that will give them effective force in the international field. In that regard, I would point out that my country attaches the utmost importance to the strengthening of the principles of non-intervention, self-determination of peoples, the equality of States in law, ideological pluralism, repudiation of any form of racial discrimination, condemnation of colonialism and neocolonialism, respect for legally concluded agreements, rejection of any form of aggression, non-validity of territorial conquests obtained through the threat or use of force, and peaceful settlement of disputes.\n5.\tWith regard to a principle as fundamental as that of respect for human rights, Ecuador not only believes in it and practices it, but also maintains the need for its universal application and above all for a general adherence to it and recognition that all the regimes of the world are morally obliged to accept it. In fact my country maintains that in the various international forums and organizations, no representative should, take a public stand on how far human rights are respected in other nations without first reporting on the situation with regard to those rights in his own country.\n6.\tI particularly wish to mention freedom of speech. Ecuador is a representative, republican democracy with free elections for the three branches of government; it has no political prisoners, no martial law, and it gives generous hospitality to those seeking asylum, exiled or fleeing from brother countries. It also prides itself on having absolutely unlimited respect for freedom of opinion, allowing access to any source of information and absolute freedom for newsmen to travel anywhere in the national territory and to enter or leave it. Ecuador's view of the debate during the last few decades about the idea of freedom of the press is that it is better to have great latitude rather than restrictions, and my Government prefers to surround the owner as well as the editor and the reporter with guarantees. Ecuador is proud to report that its media enjoy the right of dissent, within a broad democratic framework where, of course, the political parties, both in-side and outside Congress, are respected in accordance with their own decisions on their degree of co-operation, independence or opposition.\nMoreover, the Government of Ecuador believes there is a clear choice: and instead of dictatorship, which provides safeguards and privileges for the ruling regime, it prefers the democratic system, where strains and discomforts are absorbed by the executive branch in the interests of the well-being of the majority.\n7.\tThat is a principle that is backed by ethical concepts and it is also the most solid basis for any legal argument in the international field.\nA/36/PV.31\n8.\tWhile registering the gratitude of the Ecuadorian people for the expressions of solidarity received from abroad on the occasion of the tragic death of President Jaime Roldos, I must also mention the fact that Ecuador's democracy has functioned steadily following that unforeseen and regrettable event. The Vice-President, Mr. Osvaldo Hurtado, a university professor, politician and writer of broad experience, well versed in the study of our national circumstances, elected to his office by a popular vote, assumed the presidency in accordance with strict constitutional norms, and the Congress appointed as Vice-President of the Republic, by a majority and in conformity with the law, Leon Roldos, a lawyer, an expert in economic and monetary matters, and one long familiar with the subjects relating to national development. I am therefore pleased to state that the restoration of democracy in my country has suffered no setbacks, nor is there any \nlegal or political reason to justify or foresee any in the future.\n9.\tEcuador believes that the problems of regions other than the Americas which fall within the ambit of interests of the United Nations are governed by the same principles. To be specific, three pillars should uphold the legal structure that should be formed by the resolutions and actions of the United Nations, namely, the withdrawal of foreign troops from wherever they may be; the return of territories occupied by force; and free elections so that the people may exercise their capacity for self-determination and go forward by themselves to meet their destiny.\n10.\tOf course, those are the same norms that inspired the recent Ecuadorian statement on El Salvador. My Government maintains that \\\"it is up to the Salvadorians alone to find a polity,,; and democratic solution to their problems, free from any kind of foreign intervention, either direct or indirect. Within a traditionally Ecuadorian conduct opposed to violence, this statement means a condemnation of any possible military solution.\\\"\n11.\tEcuador, which in its domestic affairs respects and practices ideological pluralism and in the international field is ruled by the same guidelines and maintains relations with all kinds of countries, has since the inauguration of the present constitutional Government extended its relations to more than 20 nations of the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. Those principles governed its entry into the non-aligned movement, the members of which I greet cordially, while reaffirming that the international conduct of the Ecuadorian Government will continue to be independent and that it will not submit to any directives of the hegemonic blocs of the world, since the autonomy of our decisions and daily exercise of freedom are as deeply rooted in us as our continuous struggle for justice.\n12.\tMy country associates itself with those most characterized by their attachment to peace. That spirit, which is the inheritance of centuries, and our concept of the dignity of man make it inconceivable to us that scientific development, the world's industrial structure and the economic power of a few nations should be oriented towards warlike purposes. Such a prospect is even more fearsome if one recalls that in industrial societies man has reached the absurd extreme of producing and storing some 50,000 nuclear bombs capable of exterminating the human race 20 times over. It is therefore urgently necessary to establish a continuous warning system so that mankind may recover a certain measure of good sense, for if it should come to the extreme of arguing in favor of certain recent weapons that they destroy only human beings, that would amount to declaring that human existence is subordinate to the armaments business.\n13.\tThe unbelievably high military expenditure, which now amounts to well over $1 million a minute, is the real cause of inflation, of the disturbance of the very concept of international trade, and of distortion of the principles at the basis of economic activity, which is currently being conducted by those arms merchants.\n14.\tConsistent with that reasoning is the clear condemnation of the policy of increasing military expenditure in developing countries, particularly those whose confidence that they can impose solutions to their external problems stems from their belief that they have a greater military capacity than their neighbors.\n15.\tAmong the theaters of confrontation that represent a threat to the world is Namibia. In that connection, as in others, my country's position is clear. The foreign troops that are occupying that Territory are committing an act of rebellion against the United Nations and are the accomplices of apartheid, one of tHiTWorst forms of discrimination and racism. Therefore South Africa, a Power typified by its violations of international law, must move without delay to accept the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978), a just, solid and practicable basis for the solution of that serious problem.\n16.\tLebanon is a pathetic example of wars imported by elements foreign to the spirit of the peoples in whose territories the conflicts take place. The Lebanese people are being martyred and it is the responsibility of all, and particularly the United Nations, to put an end to this. My Government fully understands that unfortunately the solution of the Lebanese tragedy depends to a great extent on measures that must be taken by all the peoples of the Middle East. That is why we reiterate the basic principles applicable to the region, principles which in this case constitute also norms of procedure: the right of all States, including Israel, to existence and security; the need for solutions concerning all the peoples, particularly the Palestinian people; the condemnation of all forms of violence and of the retention of territories occupied by force; and the need to settle disputes by peaceful means.\n17.\tPerhaps all the world's dramas are rooted in the situation I shall now present. One of the major frustrations of the poor, who make up the majority of the world's population, consists in the persistence of economic injustices from which the affluent societies derive a profit. This generates deep resentment, acute tension and the misunderstandings between the industrialized countries of the North and the countries of the South. The objections of the former, which in international forums take advantage of the smallest preliminary points of procedure, not only hamper any kind of global strategy and common progress but also constitute a threat to the future of those same enclosed societies. If the forthcoming International Meeting on Co-operation and Development at Cancun does not succeed in opening the way and establishing at least some new guidelines for conduct, the United Nations will continue to be a forum for the expression of vague hopes and concrete disappointments and will not open up the ways towards the new international economic order, the philosophy and program of Action of which were adopted in 1974 [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)]. \n18.\tAmong the resources of primary interest in connection with which we wish to avoid title depredations and injustices of which we have been both witnesses and victims in the distribution of the world's wealth are, without doubt, the resources of the sea. Ecuador attaches due importance to those resources, and it affirms that they are the heritage of the riparian States within the already historical limit of 200 miles. But it does not limit itself to that. It further maintains that the agreements will become a mere list of theoretical calculations unless the world Powers are confronted with the firm and clear exercise of sovereignty by the riparian States over that area, sovereignty that encompasses the resources of the sea as well as those of the sea-bed and the ocean floor.\n19.\tMy country will also more assiduously protect its rights to the finite natural resource of the increasingly occupied geostationary orbit. It will do so in conjunction with the other equatorial countries and in co-operation with other developing countries, in order to make a joint contribution in an area that vitally affects the future of our peoples.\n20.\tWe are concerned that the space Powers, in an expansionist manner, may be, for purposes of power competition, exploiting outer space, which should be conceived of as a zone of peace. The arms race already involves artificial earth satellites, which are being launched at the rate of three per week; thus more than 1,700 satellites of a military nature have been placed in orbit during the past decade. Of the existing total of satellites, 75 per cent are for warlike purposes, according to the latest reports of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which includes in that figure the functions of navigation, communications, meteorology, geodesy, remote sensing and anti-satellite capability. This alarming race must be halted and brought back within the normal evolution of the universe, instead of incurring the risks of a course that could be tragic not only for the space Powers themselves, but for all the peoples that share this great spaceship called Earth.\n21.\tCasting a glance at what man is doing, or has already created, of which art is a prime example, Ecuador calls for the restitution of cultural assets to their legitimate owners, even though their acquisition may have resulted from centuries-old spoliation, tantamount, in fact, to colonialism, a vestige of times long past. World-wide restorations by the Powers involved to the native peoples that have created cultural eras could be initiated under the sponsorship of the United Nations. In this regard, the direction given to the activities of UNESCO is praiseworthy, as are the incentives extended to those who support it.\n22.\tFortunately, there are signs of understanding between dissimilar societies when they resort to the framework of the United Nations. An example of North-South co-operation in positive terms, although on a very small scale, is UNDP, with its flexible and co-ordinated action to meet the requirements of the developing world above all in the matter of the technological gap. Ecuador has firmly supported the principle of universality on which UNDP is based, and has repeatedly appealed for increased voluntary contributions on the part of all countries, rich and poof alike. For its part, despite its financial constraints, my country has amply responded to the recommendation for a minimum increase of 14 percent per year a recommendation still being ignored by those who could most afford to respond.\n23.\tAt the other, more fruitful, level of cooperation South-South Ecuador has entered, this year, into a specific project of co-operation with the sister Republic of Equatorial Guinea, with which we share a common heritage of Spanish colonization. This is but one example of the activities which Ecuador, a small country with limited economic capacity, has undertaken in co-operation with countries both within its region and in more distant latitudes.\n24.\tBecause of its intrinsic value for development, and because it is the best possible form of co-operation, we have faith in economic, social and cultural integration. For this reason, Ecuador remains active in the Andean Group, where it seeks effective fulfillment of the commitments undertaken in respect of sectoral industrial development programs, as well as those concerning a common external tariff, the lowering of duties, the common treatment of foreign capital* and, above all, the structuring of the Andean Tribunal of Justice. We Ecuadorians believe that the sub-regional process helps reduce the dependence of developing peoples, promote their harmonious progress and facilitate a consolidated position in international forums.\n25.\tWe also believe that a prerequisite is the removal of real or potential threats among its members. In this respect, it is only natural that I should mention an issue that is of crucial importance to my nation.\n26.\tIn his statement to the Assembly [6th meeting], the Foreign Minister of Peru made specific reference to the territorial problem that his country has with Ecuador. On that occasion, the tone of the statement by the Foreign Minister of Peru was conciliatory, and we Ecuadorians and all Latin Americans must appreciate it, since it can be interpreted as a shift in attitude towards a peaceful line of conduct on the part of his Government. That, assuredly, is something most worthy of note.\n27.\tOn the substance itself, when he asks that an end be put to the problem by the placing of landmarks along a 78-kilometer stretch, he is, while admitting that there is a disagreement, maintaining, in short, that the formula for a solution is Ecuador's acceptance, 100 per cent, of Peru's case.\n28.\tIn a constructive spirit, it is pertinent to recall, among the main Latin American problems related not only to the loss of territory but also to the historical exercise of sovereignty, the irrevocable rights of my country over the Mara\u00f1on, or Amazon river, which it discovered, and part of whose basin it evangelized and civilized up to its banks, on the basis of the Royal Deed of 1563.\n29.\tI shall not tire the Assembly with a review of the four continuous centuries of Quitonian and Ecuadorian presence in the Mara\u00f1on or Amazon, and its basin. To avoid entering into this long and comprehensive review, I have submitted to the Secretariat and to representatives a brief summary of the unsung heroic deeds of our religious communities and of our lay people, who devoted literally thousands of lives to the cause of the inclusion of the Amazon region within what was then the Audience of Quito and which is today the Republic of Ecuador.\n30.\tThe discovery of the Amazon river by Francisco de Orellana took place within the framework of the continuous efforts which finally led to the inclusion of the Mara\u00f1on, or Amazon river also called the River of Quito in the geography of the world.\n31.\tThe sequel to these efforts of discovery and colonization took concrete form in the Royal Deed of 1563, which, by creating the Audience of Quito, at the same time recognized for it all of the territories to the east which it might discover or colonize, which was done for no other South American Audience.\n32.\tThus it was that during the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the religious and secular citizens of Quito navigated the Napo, the Pastaza, the Morona, the Santiago, the Putumayo and other rivers, while populating Amazonia.\n33. In order to counter the effects of this historical truth Peru opposed the creation by Ecuador of the See of the Bishop of Maynas by the Royal Deed of 1802, which was not implemented, even in its religious aspect, since there was no territory.\n34.\tPeru maintains that the discovery of the,Amazon started from Cuzco, but the route followed by Orellana started from the very center of what is today our capital city. The route is a road that we use today to go to Amazonia. a road where 4,000 native citizens of the Audience of Quito died during the epic of 1541.\n35.\tI have emphasized the fact that this discovery, which was the result and the background of a long and sustained religious community effort, bears out the Ecuadorian right, which is recognized by titles beginning with the Deed of 1563 through those of 1717, 1720, 1739 and 1740, and ending with the Treaty of Guayaquil of 1829, following the declaration of Marshal Antonio Jose de Sucre, that victory grants no rights and justice must be the same before and after battle.\n36.\tIn this same brotherly spirit I say that the instructions of the armed forces and those of the Governments of all States must be positive. It makes no sense that Peru's objective should be to ignore our right and prevent the attainment of the national objective embodied in the history and in the feelings of all our people: namely, Ecuador's Amazonian destiny and its character as a riparian State of the river it discovered. It makes no sense that Peru should have undertaken to confine Ecuador by force of arms to the Amazonian tributaries only up to the point where they become navigable. It cannot be said that a country is denied its right to such banks in a zone extending east of the Cordillera del Condor, when its own representatives in 1890 acknowledged that \\\"not a shadow of reason\\\" could be adduced and that \\\"nowhere is its right less defensible\\\". With regard to that region, where the confrontations of early 1981 took place, the Foreign Minister of Peru himself publicly acknowledged at the Organization of American States [CMS] on 3 February 1981 that his country as its first act of presence, established a military outpost in 1938, that of CMvez Valdivia, thereby admitting the truth of an old Ecuadorian accusation, that Peru had violated by force of arms the status quo of 1936.\n37.\tThe Protocol of Rio de Janeiro of 29 January 1942,1 the very text of which states that it was imposed by force, mentions for the said zone a divortium aquarum, a geographical feature which in reality does not exist. The words \\\"Cordillera del Condor\\\", the feature at which Peru demands that the border be set, do not even appear in that treaty. The geographical reality of the zone was discovered in 1947 through mapping done by the Aerial Photography Service of the United States Air Force, and it was definitively confirmed by other later work.\n38.\tThat fact is so irrefutable that Ecuador has from the start repeatedly invited the Peruvian Government to set up a commission whose fundamental purpose would be to verify the geographical facts. Faced with Peru's refusal, in 1956 Ecuador reiterated to Peru, through Brazil, Chile, Argentina and the United States that it was necessary to survey the zone. Invited through these countries, Peru once more refused and went to the extreme of rejecting the suggestion by these four States that a new aerial photographic survey of the zone be made.\n39.\tPeru unilaterally maintains that the boundary in that area is the Cordillera del Condor and that it owns the eastern slope. It cites an award of 1945, which was prior to the discovery of the problems in 1947. On the basis of that reasoning, in 1981 it machine-gunned and bombed Ecuadorian outposts located in the Cordillera del Condor, on the eastern slope, even after the cease-fire had been formally agreed upon within OAS.\n*\tv\n40.\tEcuador, then, must recall that Peru has not complied with the undertakings which it was led to make by the consultative meeting and the four friendly countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States, to which Ecuador reiterates its gratitude for their endeavors in the defense of peace, which they conducted with sincerity and impartiality. Ecuador has formulated and is formulating emphatic public reservations as concerning whatever Peru may do in the zone extending east of the Cordillera del Condor, a zone as yet without boundaries, even under the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro. It is simple and categorically a matter of occupation of territories by force. The reservations which my country has encompass any military outpost, human settlements, any general infrastructure and anything that is contrary to the spirit of coexistence, which requires the parties to negotiate on pending problems and not presume to solve them unilaterally or limit themselves to denying that such problems exist.\n41.\tOn this occasion I address a new appeal to the Government of Peru to undertake and maintain negotiations leading to an understanding that may solve one of the oldest problems of the continent, as mentioned by the Secretary-General, whose concern for the restoration of peace was appreciated at the time by Ecuador, and his reference to the problem in his report on the work of the Organization [see A/36/1, sect. IV] is inspired by a spirit of concord with which my country fully concurs.\n42.\tI reiterate before the Assembly the words President Osvaldo Hurtado spoke before the National House of Representatives in his message of 10 August:\n\\\"The armed conflict of the beginning of the year and its dramatic after-effects must lead us Ecuadorians to meditate seriously on our territorial tragedy and to And a solution that would allow us to solve it definitively. Ecuador has permanently sought, by various means, what constitutes its vital aspiration: a solution of peace and justice to the border problem with Peru.\\\"\n43.\tEcuador, a signatory of the San Francisco Charter, looks upon the Organization as the maximum guarantee and the embodiment of the will of the peoples, which is the source of international law in our time. That is why it gives its support,, without reservation, to the United Nations, in which it places its trust, and expresses its fervent wishes for the attainment of the noble ideals which inspire the Organization. My people and my Government will spare no effort that may be necessary to achieve that end.\n"

His personal qualities augur well for his success in performing the important functions entrusted to him by the Assembly.\n179.\tI should also like to pay a tribute of admiration and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von\nWechmar, for his leadership of the thirty-fifth session, which all previous speakers have acknowledged to have been dynamic and decisive.\n180.\tFinally, I should like to express the admiration of the delegation of Costa Rica for the consummate skill with which the Secretary-General has carried out his important duties.\n181.\tIt is an honor and a privilege for me to be able to welcome to the United Nations a sovereign and independent Belize. We share the great emotion which its representatives must feel today. Their presence will lend renewed vigor to the United Nations, which with each day that passes represents all the peoples of the earth with greater enthusiasm. We welcome Belize's entry into the United Nations, where common struggles await us. After 35 years we are witnessing the collapse of colonialism all over the world. This is one of the great achievements of the United Nations and the fulfillment of one of the fundamental principles of its Charter.\n182.\tI have great pleasure in welcoming the Republic of Vanuatu as a Member of the United Nations. Costa Rica was most gratified when Vanuatu became independent on 30 July 1980 and wishes this new Member State a happy, peaceful and prosperous future for its people, trusting that its newfound freedom and self-determination will be preserved and strengthened.\n183.\tAs the Secretary-General so clearly says in his report [A/3611], the picture of international risks and dangers which he described to us a year ago, far from disappearing, has become more disturbing than ever.\n184.\tThere has not been the necessary will in international affairs to permit the major changes which might enable peoples to live together in harmony. There has been no change in the politics of domination which continue to block the possibilities of progress towards a better world for all mankind.\n185.\tThe political and ideological struggles between the great Powers have intensified, while in some regions new sources of armed conflict have arisen. The competition for spheres of influence continues unabated, thwarting the aspiration of peoples to a world order in which weak and powerful nations alike would organize their relations and tackle their common problems with the full participation of all.\n186.\tIn the light of this disturbing situation, the purposes and principles of the United Nations acquire greater relevance. Costa Rica believes in international organizations. We believe that within this Organization and under its auspices we can reconcile extreme positions and settle the conflicts which threaten peace and justice. We can develop a feeling of human solidarity despite the incomprehension and intransigence of a handful of States. If we are tenacious and persevering we shall be able to achieve these goals through concerted political, social and economic action.\n187.\tAs the Assembly begins its work this year, the Government of Costa Rica would like to place on record its position on some of the serious problems confronting the international community.\n188.\tCentral America today is an erupting volcano. It is the battlefield for the struggle of peoples for freedom and dignity, and it roust suffer all the unhappy consequences of that struggle. The peoples of Central America are demanding greater social justice, complete freedom and respect for human dignity. Various forces and interests oppose these legitimate demands: the selfishness of those who wish to maintain the status quo for the benefit of the few, in total disregard of the vast majority; the direct damage caused to our countries by the international economic situation, particularly inflation, the drop in international market prices for our commodity exports and the inordinate rise in the price of energy-related products, all of which affect our region particularly, because of its geographical, economic, social and political situation; and, finally, the manipulation by extremist ideologies which, taking advantage of these circumstances, are trying to subvert the people's legitimate ideals and steer our nations towards the fateful goal of left-wing or right-wing extremism.\n189.\tWe are confident that the countries of Central America will manage to emerge from this titanic struggle as democratic nations committed to peace, freedom and justice.\n190.\tIt is with sorrow that we witness the bloodbath suffered by the fraternal people of El Salvador. Costa Rica has given its backing to the Government of President Duarte, as a viable transitional formula by which the country can move towards institutionalization, and is grateful for the latter's efforts to achieve a peaceful and lasting solution by means of a political dialog leading to the expression of the popular will in free and democratic elections.\n191.\tThe problems facing Central America do not concern that region alone. Our success or failure in resolving the crisis has a direct bearing on the future of democracy not only in the region but throughout the world.\n192.\tThe geographical, economic and social constraints suffered by the countries of the region prevent them from resolving the crisis without the support of the community of nations. The international community knows this and is willing to help, for such is the duty of every country in the world that believes in democracy and whose system of government is based on freedom, justice and peace. The industrialized countries have a special responsibility, for they are in the best position to help and cooperate in the defense of democracy and of these fundamental principles.\n193.\tIn this context, we have promoted the Central American dialog, and we have acknowledged with enthusiasm the interest expressed by the Foreign Ministers of Canada, Mexico, the United States and Venezuela to assist the region in the search for solutions to its economic problems. Also, we support the proposal of the Foreign Minister of Peru to set up a trust fund that would serve as a basis for an aid program of horizontal cooperation [6th meeting, para. 163],\n194.\tNotwithstanding the serious crisis in the region, my country has continued to conduct its affairs in a peaceful and orderly fashion, respecting the electoral decisions of its people, solving its problems within a state of law and trusting in God and man. We have been the calm eye in the middle of the cyclone that buffets our suffering neighbors.\n195.\tIn the struggle between spiritual and purely material values, between freedom without bread and bread without freedom, we Costa Ricans have achieved the ideal goal of bread and freedom. For 160 years we have upheld the ideals of economic and social justice, freedom, respect for human rights and representative government,\n196.\tBut all this can change if we are not careful. There can be no doubt that our peaceful way of life and our love of freedom are threatened by the critical situation facing the world today. This is why, in the interests of the very survival of democracy, intelligent and close collaboration is needed now more than ever before between the industrialized and developing countries. It is only by unity of action that we can move forward, preserving system that affords man the best opportunities in his search for happiness and his enjoyment of peace, freedom and justice,\n197.\tI wish to reiterate that my country is aware of the historic role that the stability of its democratic system demands that it play in the Central American region. Consequently, we desire the establishment in Central America of governments that are a true expression of the popular will, the product of an electoral process, a democratic manifestation in the true sense of the word; governments that will lead their peoples to economic and social progress in peace and freedom.\n198.\tThe Latin American countries form a group of re> publics with ties unmatched anywhere in the world. Latin. American unity is an historical necessity if our countries* are to be able to play their part in the community of nations and develop their potential to the full. Today, despite its difficult economic situation, its precarious social stability and its slow progress towards democracy, Latin America is part of the developing world that shows a greater identity of aims, a greater convergence towards those aims and a greater possibility of managing to achieve them.\n199.\tLatin Americans must be alive to the tremendous historical importance of the present moment and of our responsibility towards the future, which calls for wisdom and courage in the decisions which our peoples expect and demand of us. By striving for a Latin American consensus free of intolerance and exclusivity, we shall be helping to strengthen the United Nations.\n200.\tMy country has been a staunch supporter of all the efforts and actions to change the present international order and lay the bases for genuine cooperation among' all States. We are convinced of the effectiveness and the necessity of common action in this era of determined opposition to domination and exploitation. The unity and solidarity of the third world are the new alternative for securing recognition for the common aspirations for justice and equity.\n201.\tWe realize that it will be difficult for our countries to move ahead with their development programs until the foundations have been laid of a new international economic order which places the same value on our raw materials and our labor as it does on the labor, manufactured goods and technologies of the industrialized' countries. In this connection, the NorthSouth and South\nSouth dialogs and the global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development are especially significant.\n202.\tMy delegation notes with regret that, 35 years after the Assembly first considered the question of apartheid, the Government of South Africa continues to repress that country's black population. The United Nations cannot continue to be a passive witness to events in southern Africa. Costa Rica supports the measures taken by the United Nations in the struggle against apartheid.\n203.\tI should like to emphasize once again that there is a tradition of antiracism in Costa Rica, one that has its roots in our history. All the ethnic groups in our country have mixed spontaneously, and we are proud to be a nation with a democratic system that allows every Costa Rican without distinction to develop his skills.\n204.\tMy delegation hopes that more decisive steps will be taken at this session to put an end to this form of totalitarianism, and, on behalf of our Government, we shall vote in favour of and join in any action that might further the struggle against apartheid and contribute to its final eradication.\n205.\tThe Government of Costa Rica condemns South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. South Africa has an obligation to withdraw its administration from that Territory so that the people of Namibia can achieve a genuine independence that respects their territorial integrity, including Walvis Bay and the coastal islands. We support the legitimate struggle of the Namibian people for self determination.\n206.\tWe strongly condemn the invasion of Angola recently committed by South Africa from Namibia. My delegation considers the situation in Namibia to be a threat to international peace and security and therefore urges all Member States to strengthen the comprehensive sanctions against South Africa in order to compel it to comply immediately with United Nations resolutions on Namibia.\n207.\tWith respect to the situation in Afghanistan, the delegation of Costa Rica stated its position at the Security Council's emergency meeting called in response to requests by numerous States Members of the United Nations, Costa Rica among them, which believed that what was happening in Afghanistan then, and is still happening there today, constitutes a serious violation of the fundamental principles of international law by one of the permanent members of the Security Council and hence a grave threat to international peace and security.\n208.\tThe position taken then remains the same today. Like most of the countries of the third world, my country relies on the enforcement of international law for its external Security and is above any suspicion of seeking to interfere in the internal affairs of its neighbors or of any other nation. We are concerned therefore that treaties of friendship, cooperation and good-neighborliness can overnight become tools of aggression, invasion and intervention in the affairs of a sovereign State. We are also concerned over what happens in any other part of the world, especially when the good faith and friendly intentions that inspire international law are violated.\n209.\tFor years, Costa Rica has followed developments in Cyprus with keen attention and interest. We attach the greatest importance to the preservation of that country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions, and we hope that the sense of responsibility of the States and communities directly involved in the conflict will prevail.\n210.\tThe Government of Costa Rica maintains the position it has taken at previous sessions of the General Assembly with regard to the serious situation in the Middle East. There are several difficult elements in that conflict, some of them deeply painful, such as the useless bloodbath inflicted on the communities of Lebanon, for whom the international community should be able to guarantee the right and the real possibility for finding peace and harmony, without the outside interference that makes that impossible. Other elements, besides being painful, seriously threaten the peace of the world; among them is the ArabIsraeli conflict. We believe that the problem could be solved if the parties to the conflict were truly determined to put an end to it and if all involved accepted that both an Israeli and a Palestinian State have a right to existence, that dialog is the best means of relaxing the tensions between the parties and is a prerequisite to formal negotiations, and that the Israeli and Palestinian States have a right to live within definite, secure borders guaranteed by the United Nations.\n211.\tWere the parties to the conflict to agree to those principles, the problem could be solved and the borders of the States could be fixed in a universally satisfactory manner. The Government of Costa Rica has a very clear picture of what the Middle East could be if all the States there were to put an end to hostilities and launch a program of cooperation among themselves, thereby heeding the call for peace that we have so often made in this forum.\n212.\tWe have always added Costa Rica's voice to those of many other Member States and have joined in the efforts to achieve peace, justice, freedom and respect for human rights in Kampuchea. Like all peace-loving peoples, we believe that the people of Kampuchea deserves to be allowed to live in peace and fully to exercise its rights as a sovereign and independent State.\n213.\tStrategic interests cannot take precedence over the longing of peoples for freedom nor usurp their right to genuine self-determination, territorial integrity and independence. That is why my delegation supported General Assembly resolutions 34/22 and 35/6 and believes we must continue to insist on fulfillment of the requirements outlined in paragraph 3 of resolution 35/6. I should like to reiterate our hope that the difficult and serious situation in Kampuchea will be resolved by means of the necessary political will and a manifestation of the spirit of justice.\n214.\tFaithful to the fundamental principles of the United Nations, my country believes that the process of decolonization resulting from the effective exercise by peoples of their right to self-determination is now almost complete.\n215.\tMy Government supports and will continue to support all legitimate struggles for the effective exercise of the right to self-determination in accordance with resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV), which were adopted by the General Assembly 20 years ago and which have since been both guide and foundation of the decolonization process. That is why we have supported the just aspirations of the POLISARIO Front\\\" and have recognized the sovereign and independent Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic.\n216.\tIn all the years that the question of Korea has been before the General Assembly, Costa Rica has advocated direct contacts between the two parties at the highest level with a view to arriving at an understanding that would put an end once and for all to a tense situation which affects not only the Korean peninsula but also the entire region of NorthEast Asia. Despite the repeated initiatives of the Republic of Korea, as put forward by President Chun on 12 January 1981 and again on 5 June, and despite the support of Members of this Organization for direct dialog as a means of achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea, no such contacts have been possible.\n217.\tMy country further believes that both Koreas should be admitted as full Members of the Organization, as a first step towards creating an international climate of reconciliation and, ultimately, peaceful democratic reunification, that is, by means of free elections, thereby enhancing the principle of the universality of the United Nations.\n218.\tMy delegation once again appeals to Member States to make their positive contribution towards creating a favourable climate for the resumption of the dialog between North Korea and South Korea and for the peaceful resolution of the question of Korea.\n219.\tIt has become a frustrating ritual for those of us who come to the Assembly year after year to draw attention to the grave risks presented by the arms race, to speak in the debate on that subject. The military forces of the great Powers and the tremendous destructive power of their weapons cast the darkest of shadows over the world. The arms race is a fierce competition to acquire more and better weapons. Not only do nuclear weapons pose an intolerable threat because of the unspeakable devastation that they cause, but the theories about their use and the prospects of their spread to other States magnify that threat and can make disarmament ever more difficult to achieve.\n220.\tIn this connection, I should like also to emphasize the importance my country attaches to all efforts to prevent the militarization of outer space and to reiterate once again Costa Rica's pacifist vocation and its conviction that it is only through conciliation and peace that our peoples can move forward.\n221.\tWe are convinced that the problems of disarmament, although difficult and complex, can be solved if weak and powerful together are determined to solve them. The future of mankind depends to a large extent on how we solve those problems, and in that process the United Nations will continue to be the most appropriate body for pooling our efforts and freeing mankind from the threat of destruction.\n222.\tThe question of the University for Peace was first brought before the Assembly at its thirty-fourth session, when the idea of establishing the University was approved and an international commission created to prepare its organization, structure and setting in motion [resolution 341 111]. The Commission's report\\\" was presented to the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session. On the Commission's recommendation, on 5 December 1980, the Assembly decided by consensus to establish the University for Peace and approved the University's Charter and the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace. Since that time 20 countries have signed the Agreement.\n\n223.\tThe University is conceived as an international institution created with the intellectual and material cooperation of all countries, as a melting pot where different cultures can make their contribution to peace, as an international forum where the theoretical and practical problems of peace and war can be studied and explained, and as a house of learning which can create alternatives for peaceful coexistence among all the peoples of the earth.\n224.\tOn behalf of the Government of Costa Rica, I should like to thank the General Assembly for its clear and resolute support for this venture. We are especially grateful to the Secretariat and above all to the Secretary General, who made his own decisive contribution to the new institution's promising future by appointing such an eminent and representative Council, which will no doubt convince the world, and the United Nations in particular, of the immense challenge facing the University and help ensure that its objectives are achieved and even surpassed.\n225.\tI make a fervent appeal to all Governments to make their decisive contribution to this new venture, designed to strengthen the foundations needed for establishing an increasingly just and, hence, increasingly peaceful world.\n226.\tCosta Rica is confident that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will finally complete its work in spring 1982 in New York. We are ready to take final decisions at that last session and then to go to Caracas with all the other participating States to adopt the Convention on the Law of the Sea so long awaited by the international community. It is in this spirit that we urge those nations which appear to have problems with the text of a convention which was forged with the assistance and understanding of all participants to join in working towards a consensus with the greatest good will. Failure to adopt a convention like that embodied in what is now the Conference's official text would seriously damage the relations between rich and poor nations and would no doubt become a further source of international tension.\n227.\tHuman rights constitutes one of the issues to which the Organization has devoted time, effort and determination. As it is one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy which we have reaffirmed in numerous declarations, we shall support any initiatives which might help to strengthen human rights and promote their strict observance and protection wherever there is an attempt to violate or lessen them.\n228.\tThe question of human rights is becoming more relevant every day, which makes it increasingly vital and indispensable that the international community join jn efforts to protect them. We believe that human rights are a matter of universal importance. Costa Rica believes that it must pursue its efforts in support of the creation of a post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n229.\tI should like to draw attention to the concern expressed by the Secretary-General in his report to the General Assembly at the lack of appropriate ways and means of filling the vacuum that exists in the field of the promotion of and respect for human rights. Costa Rica, a staunch defender of human rights and fundamental freedoms, is seeking to strengthen the international machinery for the protection and promotion of human rights, so as to guarantee or improve the conditions in which such rights are exercised internationally.\n230.\tThe Government of Costa Rica is deeply concerned at the serious refugee problem, which often threatens the political and social stability and economic development of the States and regions concerned, especially developing regions. That is why it cosponsored resolution 35/124 on the subject, adopted on 11 December 1980. That resolution represented an important step in the search for a solution to this problem at the present session of the General Assembly. At future sessions the international community will be called upon to consider not only the humanitarian aspects of the problem but also the adoption of preventive measures to prevent new flows of refugees.\n231.\tThe Government of Costa Rica supports the ideas and suggestions formulated by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany in the Security Council and wishes to express the hope that other Members will participate and help in ensuring that these ideas and suggestions are discussed fully so that we can proceed in this direction in close cooperation.\n232.\tCosta Rica has requested the inclusion in the agenda of a new item entitled \\\"Declaration of a Peace Year, a Peace Month and a Peace Day\\\" [see A/361197] not only because it is committed to the cause of peace but also because it acted as host to the Sixth Triennial Conference of the International Association of University Presidents held at San Jose from 28 June to 3 July 1981, which proposed such an initiative. My Government welcomed the proposal and had the honor of submitting it to the General Assembly at the thirty-sixth session. I shall not go into the details of the draft resolution here, Its text will be submitted to delegations in the hope that this initiative will receive the General Assembly's broad support.\n233.\tI should like to end by reiterating my country's faith in the validity and vitality of the Organization. We are firm believers in the decisive role that the United Nations must play in shaping the future of mankind in an environment of peace, freedom and universal justice.\n\n"

        "file_text": "223.\t Sir, I should like to begin by extending to you my warmest words of congratulation on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is with profound satisfaction that we once again see serving the international community someone whose human qualities and vast experience as politician and diplomat guarantee that we shall reach positive results during this session.\n224.\tI am very pleased to see this high office occupied by the representative of a friendly Arab nation with which we share so many historical and traditional links and specially from Iraq, whose relations with Portugal have teen marked by a close and fruitful cooperation that we wish to maintain and develop.\n225.\tI should also like to express our sincere esteem and gratitude to Mr. von Wechmar for his constant and devoted efforts in favour of peace and justice and for the untiring and commendable manner in which he dedicated himself to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We have the highest respect for his excellent contribution to the good conduct of our work last year.\n226.\tFinally, I wish to address a special word of greeting and gratitude to the Secretary-General, who recently greatly honoured our country with an official visit. His clear vision of the international community, his human and diplomatic qualities, and the competent and devoted way in which he guides the work of the Organization are all worthy of our highest praise.\n227.\tWe welcome the admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Vanuatu and we extend to its Government and people our sincere congratulations. We also express the hope that soon we may see amongst\\\" us Belize, which we warmly welcome today on its independence. These are most encouraging signs that step by step we are approaching one of the highest goals of the United Nations universality.\n228.\tThe General Assembly has gathered once again to avail itself of the diligence and efforts of its Members to analyze and debate the grave issues facing the world which, for the major part, call for an urgent solution. Notwithstanding their best efforts, it is not an easy task to find new solutions, to follow up and reinforce those already advocated and to remove the obstacles in the path of peace and progress.\n229.\tProfound changes in the international system have been brought about by the cumulative effects of diverse factors. The agenda of the General Assembly has been broadened beyond the traditional themes of security and the balance of power to include matters of increasing complexity which pose a continuing challenge to the Governments of all the countries here represented. However, like the speakers who preceded me and those who will follow, I am certain that we, the Members of this distinguished Organization, will do our utmost to find the proper solutions.\n230.\tThe continuing situation in Afghanistan, where a Soviet intervention, persists in open violation of the Charter and in defiance of the condemnation of international public opinion and of the Assembly, constitutes clear evidence of a policy of expansion and of the ensuing risks to stability and international detente. Convinced that the present situation is not evolving favorably, and aware of the risk it represents to the geostrategic balance of power and to peace, the Portuguese Government has clearly and consistently condemned the persistence of a situation that is both politically and juridical unacceptable.\n231.\tIn this spirit, my delegation wishes to express its full support for the recent plan of the European Council meeting at Luxembourg on 29 and 30 June 13 for the convening of an international conference within the framework of the diplomatic efforts initiated by the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.\n232.\tThe invasion and occupation of Kampuchea by the Vietnamese armed forces have also been condemned by an overwhelming majority of the States Members of the Organization, including my own country. Portugal considers that a solution to this problem must be based on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of Kampuchea. We further consider that the International Conference convened earlier this year by the United Nations constituted an important step towards the peaceful solution of this conflict.\n233.\tIn view of such situations as these, the fundamental question confronting the General Assembly is to decide whether the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)} and the Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between Participating\nStates included in the Final Act of Helsinki of 1 August 1975 actually derive from a will to organize the world in a more peaceful and humane manner, or whether they represent smokescreens hiding contradictory aspirations, mental reservations or subjective interpretations. Were this to be the case, we would all be cooperating on the basis of a false and therefore dangerous construction, built on quicksand and made only of misunderstandings and empty words.\n234.. These fundamental questions have been, and still are under discussion in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe meeting in Madrid. New proposals and criticisms presented there must not be seen as contrary to detente, but in their proper context of review and positive appraisal. What cannot be admitted is a concept of detente that allows it to exist simultaneously as an instrument of cooperation and struggle in all fields, to suit each party's interests at any given moment. If detente is a necessity of international life, the practice of reciprocity is essential to it.\n235.\tFurthermore, good faith is required if detente is to lead to cooperation in all fields and to the elimination, or at least the easing of tensions. This is, we believe, the correct position, one which has guided our participation in this important meeting within the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. We still hope that such an approach will prevail and that substantial results will be achieved.\n236.\tFinally, the principles of detente must also be observed and respected in the relations between countries with basically similar political and social systems. In fact, there is no sense in confining respect for the principles of detente, peace, territorial integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of States to relations between countries with different systems. Moreover, we think that drastic action against them will inevitably lead to developments difficult to control and therefore capable of generating the most dangerous reactions.\n237.\tIt has often been stated here that the degree of technological development in the field of armaments has rendered obsolete the classic geographical theories of defense. We all know that the security that resulted from distance and natural frontiers is today to a certain extent greatly reduced, if not nullified. The sole reality is that the capability for mutual destruction exists.\n238.\tConsidering, from this perspective* the destabilizing changes that have taken place during the last several years in the military balance between East and West, it seems appropriate for me to underline the fact that NATO, of which Portugal is an active and committed member, consider the stability of the military balance to be an important and timely contribution to general security and peace.\n239.\tThis is also the primary objective of arms control, the aim of which is to attain a balance of power at a minimal level of armaments, especially nuclear armaments, without loss of security. The decision taken by the members of NATO on 12 December 1979\\\" served that purpose. In this sense, my country strongly supports the important negotiaions between the United States and the Soviet Union which are due to open before the end of this year and for which my country will express its support where necessary.\n240.\tIn the field of disarmament, nuclear weapons, because of their awesome power of destruction, should receive special attention, as was decided by consensus at the tenth special session of this Assembly [resolution S10/2]. The ban on all nuclear weapon testing, subject to effective international inspection and accepted by all parties concerned, would be a significant contribution. It would also be desirable to have the nuclear Powers agree on a common formula of guarantees to strengthen the security of States that do not possess nuclear weapons, thus responding to the legitimate concern frequently expressed in this Assembly. However, our concern with nuclear weapons should not mask the fact that the power of the militarily more important States results from the combination of their nuclear .and conventional arsenals. Negotiating efforts in the field of nuclear disarmament should not serve as a pretext for the international community to refuse a parallel effort in the field of conventional weapons.\n241.\tIt is our hope that the second special session on disarmament will allow us collectively to review the achievements in the field of disarmament in the light of the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, whose validity remains intact. We hope its conclusions will help the negotiations and assure them of significant progress in this field.\n242.\tI should now like to mention some of the problems that contribute to the worsening of Regional tensions and jeopardize the United Nations principles and capacity for effective intervention. The question of Namibia, where South Africa persists in maintaining an illegal situation, thus preventing the Namibian people from exercising their right to self-determination, has led to attacks on Angolan territory that are to be condemned. Almost three years have elapsed since the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), yet, notwithstanding the constant diplomatic initiatives of the SecretaryGeneral and of the \\\"contact group\\\", with the support of the frontline States, the legitimate hopes for a final settlement have not yet been fulfilled.\n243.\tThe recent invasion of Angola's territory unjustifiable on any grounds, and undermining the principles of international law that should govern us all is a negative result of a latent confrontation that must urgently be solved through political means.\n244.\tThe events in southern Angola represent an evident sign of the risks created by the present situation, resulting in heavy sacrifices for the sovereign State of Angola, with which we renew our solidarity. We should not forget, either, the attack perpetrated on Mozambique last January, which we equally reject.\n245.\tMy country has supported Namibia's independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and trusts the diplomatic efforts that the \\\"contact group\\\" has been conducting within its framework. This support we reiterate today, convinced that new delays or unacceptable intransigence may lead to a grave confrontation in southern. Africa, with dire repercussions on international stability.\n246.\tAnother source of tension that has been debated here for several years, without the concrete results that the security of the international community would demand, is the question of the Middle East. This is a question of particular and universal importance, in view of the high values and interests at stake and of all its inherent risks. Portugal has clearly expressed its standpoint, defending the establishment of a climate of conciliation and mutual respect that would put an end to the present growing armed confrontations and consolidate an essential spirit of negotiation. My Government has thus stressed the responsibility of the international community in contributing to a global solution that would lead to Israel's withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied since 1967, and to the dismantling of the settlements established since then. We have supported the recognition of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, with all its consequences, and of their return. We have defended the right to full security and sovereignty within safe and recognized boundaries of all countries in the area, including Israel, We have called for an end to the unacceptable violations of the territorial integrity of Lebanon. We have condemned the Israeli attack on Iraq's nuclear installations, for it constituted a grave violation of the sovereignty of Iraq and of the principle of the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\n247.\tOn the other hand, my country has stressed the urgent need for a mutual effort towards an understanding between Israel and the PLO, based on a mutual recognition that would take into account unquestionable political realities and help create a peaceful future for the area. To this end, it is legitimate to hope that the Government of Tel Aviv may draw from the martyred history of the Jewish people such human understanding as will permit it to break the present circle of intransigence, recognizing that' the Palestinian people cannot be denied the political, national and social rights that have made possible the existence and consolidation of the State of Israel itself.\n248.\tIt is in this context that Portugal supports the diplomatic initiatives particularly the, efforts made by the EEC\u2014that, hopefully, will substitute for the present confrontation an indispensable dialog of peace and cooperation. Likewise, the recent plan advanced by Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia represents a significant political step that should be given the attention that it deserves.\n249.\tStill within the existing sources of international tension that are gloomily pictured in our agenda, we should acknowledge with hope that progress has been achieved under the auspices of the OAU on the problem of the selfdetermination of Western Sahara. We salute the spirit of negotiation resulting in the exploration of avenues leading towards a democratic solution and an equitable conciliation of the legitimate interests of the parties concerned.\n250.\tAs is known, Portugal's adherence as quickly as possible to the European Communities, to which my Government remains deeply committed, reflects the profound political, economic, social and cultural realities that identify us with the countries members of those Communities. This goal is in keeping with the legitimate aspirations of the Portuguese people and constitutes one of the main priorities of my Government within the framework of its global policy and its. external action.\n251.\tPortugal faces as a challenge the important tasks resulting from its adherence. They will no doubt bring about significant changes and improvements in the economic and social structure of our country. We share the model of a democratic and free society existing in the Communities, just as we equally share the spirit of solidarity characterizing its actions not only in its geographical region but also on a worldwide basis.\n\n252.\tIn a broader field, we view with concern that the efforts being made to diminish the profound disparities between developed and developing countries are not achieving the desired results. This is the result mainly of the present economic crisis, which impedes the availability of additional resources for development.\n253.\tBecause of its intermediate state of economic development, Portugal is in a position to understand the difficulties facing both sides. We attach importance to all initiatives aimed at overcoming the present crisis. We believe that all countries should contribute to these initiatives, regardless of their own level of development or economic and social systems. That is the only way to keep the NorthSouth dialog alive and to contribute to the timely launching of the global negotiations, which have given rise to so many hopes in the international community. It is in that spirit that Portugal has actively participated in several meetings and conferences of the United Nations, more particularly the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. We support the basic idea of the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development which will be held at Cancun, and we hope that this meeting will bear positive results and a better understanding between countries with larger dimensions and consequently commitments, and those which have suffered more because of their lack of resources.\n254.\tWe share the view that there are two main problems which stand out in the complex of development: energy and food. Interlinked and complementary, these two issues, which are indeed important to the international community as a whole, to a large extent determine the possibilities of overcoming the stage of underdevelopment. In fact, more than two thirds of mankind are afflicted with a scarcity of food and energy jeopardizing all efforts towards development. Because of the worldwide crisis in energy products and the acute world food and agricultural situation causing the depletion of grain reserves and the consequent price increases, the importing countries, in addition to endangering gravely their balance of payments, must allocate to these consumer products resources that are vital to support the structural changes capable of allowing them to make progress on the path to development.\n255.\tMy country has historic relations with a group of nations occupying extensive areas of what is traditionally called the third world. Together with the leaders of these nations, we have embarked upon broader cooperation, cooperation which hitherto has been mainly bilateral. Our growing and untiring efforts are aimed at diversifying this cooperation which we intend to intensify with the third-world countries and the specialized agencies. Thus we hope to overcome a situation representing an obstacle to progress, one which is an insult to human dignity.\n256.\tWe believe that the gradual elimination of international tension and divisions among nations is closely linked to the universal promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Human rights must be considered as an integral part of a global dimension required for all activities we pursue in our search for justice, security and development, as well as for a fruitful dialog between the acting partners of the international\ncommunity.\n257.\tAs we have already mentioned, this is a particularly important aspect of the present world situation. Serious violations of individual rights are still occurring, and there are still situations where human dignity is ignored. The right of peoples to self-determination and independence is viewed with contempt. The territorial integrity of sovereign States and their right to decide freely on their own system of government are blatantly disregarded. Thus the foundations of democratic society and international relations are being jeopardized. Since these are the basic principles guiding this Organization's work, we as Member States are bound to respect, abide by and promote them.\n258.\tThis is a field where the United Nations, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter, has the responsibility to promote and protect human rights and to provide an opportunity for dialog and cooperation among its Member States with the most diverse systems and historical and social conditions. It is our view that such a task can be fulfilled only through enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations system, whose capabilities to intervene should also be strengthened. That is the position we have been advocating particularly during the past three years in the Commission on Human Rights, of which we have had the privilege of being a member.\n259.\tThe Portuguese Government attaches the highest importance to the observance of these principles, which are enshrined in clear and decisive terms in our Constitution and integrated in the daytoday practice of the Portuguese people. We have stated as much in the report on the implementation of the rights protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights preserve*! by Portugal to the last session of the Commission on Human Rights.15\n260.\tWe wish to reiterate the importance we attach to civil and political rights, which are the very foundation of our own historical reality. Even though we recognize that the effective enjoyment of such rights calls for the improvement of the present economic, social and cultural conditions, we cannot agree that the search for such improvement should take precedence over the guarantee of what we consider to be the fundamental rights inherent in human dignity, which, above all, we must protect at any cost.\n261.\tHowever, we think it is far more important to ensure effective and increasingly wide protection of all rights than to form a hierarchy of various types of rights. Let us remain hopeful that those rights will be implemented. This is a field in which a primary role must be played by the international community and for which the United Nations has a special responsibility.\n262.\tStill regarding the protection of the rights of peoples, I must mention that one problem persists which is a reminder of our common incapacity to make the principles of the Charter and international law prevail in the practice of nations. I am referring to East Timor. Year after year appeals and condemnations have been repeated here concerning a situation that is condemned by legal and moral standards and prevents the people of Timor from freely exercising their right to self-determination.\n263.\tConscious of our responsibility in defending the future of that people, to which we are historically bound, and concerned with the difficult conditions and the serious problems facing East Timor, my Government has shown an availability for dialog reflected in some detail in the report of the Secretariat itself that until now has unfortunately not met with an adequate response. In spite of the difficulties of the problem, Portugal will continue seeking to develop and exhaust all diplomatic efforts that will protect the national rights and the identity of the people of Timor in accordance with the spirit of the Charter.\n264.\tThe resolution of this problem lies within the responsibility of the United Nations. However, Portugal, having no territorial claims whatsoever to East Timor, acknowledges its responsibilities in helping to find solutions by consent that are in keeping with the right of self-determination.\n265.\tMany and grave are the problems demanding an urgent solution that are faced by the international community. Without the goodwill of peoples in the struggle against misery, hunger and war, the ingenuity of man and the potential of States will continue to be misdirected towards the perpetuation of conflicts, and thus the progress and wellbeing of mankind will be set aside. We trust that common sense will prevail and that the world of tomorrow will see the conflagrations that now afflict mankind progressively diminish.\n266.\tIt is our profound belief that the United Nations will play an important role in this fundamental harmonization of efforts.\n"

        "file_text": "95.\t  First of all, may I associate myself, on behalf of the Government and people of the Upper Volta, with previous speakers in expressing deepest condolences to the Egyptian people and to the bereaved family of President Sadat, whose brutal and tragic death was a profound shock to us. We hope that the memory of that great African statesman will inspire all men of good will in their struggle for peace.\n96.\tWhen the Military Committee for National Recovery and Progress decided, on 25 November 1980, to assume leadership of the country, some saw in that a repetition of a coup d'etat in that part of Africa. In so doing, they were too quick to forget and for good reason that the constant deterioration in the political, economic and social situation, so full of promise and hope, that had compelled the admiration of the world for our form of democracy, had become potentially dangerous for the future and wellbeing of our working people.\n97.\tWe are convinced that the major objectives announced by our head of State, Colonel Saye Zerbo, Chairman of the Military Committee for National Recovery and Progress, in his speech of 1 May 1981 did a lot to reassure them. Those objectives are to ensure for our country development based on the elimination of all external domination and the exploitation of man by man; development based, above all, on our own resources so that we can bring about our own wellbeing; a social policy based on giving highest priority to satisfying the fundamental needs of the citizens of our country, particularly the least privileged classes; the fulfillment of the human person as an individual and within the framework of the family, as well as professionally and collectively, by promoting national wellbeing, culture and identity; and dynamic, effective international cooperation.\n98.\tAs a spokesman for the Military Committee for National Recovery and Progress, the people of the Upper Volta and the Government, I have come to this rostrum today to make known to you our views on the urgent problems of the current international situation and to share with you the new hopes and the disappointments which have been prompted in us by this annual ritual of the sessions of the General Assembly of the Organization.\n99.\tFirst, however, I should like to bid a warm welcome to Vanuatu and Belize on their admission to the Organization. I am convinced that these two new Members will make a valuable contribution to the achievement of the\n, noble objectives of the Charter.\n100.\tMay I pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, who presided with such firmness and good humor over the proceedings of the previous session. This is a particular pleasure for me, because his country and mine maintain links of solid and friendly cooperation.\n101.\tIt is also fitting that I should voice praise here for the tireless efforts of the Secretary General and express to him our great appreciation for the work he has been doing to fulfill the ideals of the Charter.\n102.\tYour election, Sir, to the presidency of this thirty- sixth session of the General Assembly is, by reason of your qualities and competence, a good augury for the conduct of our proceedings. I hope you will accept the congratulations of my delegation, which assures you of its constant readiness to aid you in your difficult task.\n103.\tWe are living today in a troubled, disordered and pitiless world. Unfortunately, that observation is not a new one, and we must live in our time. The ideals proclaimed in the Charter seem remote even inaccessible. Nevertheless the peoples of the world ardently yearn to see them pursued and achieved.\n104.\tHow is it that year after year we have been coming to this rostrum to declare that the world is sick because the international community is divided, because poverty and injustice far too often still hold sway, because the exploitation of man by man knows no respite, and because, in the final analysis, what is lacking is a concerted political will for us to unite for victory?\n105.\tHow is it that year after year there seems to be no noticeable improvement in international relations?\n106.\tHow is it that today, like yesterday, we seem to be offering sacrifices to tradition, to a routine which we go through without, illusions and which we will repeat without enthusiasm?\n107.\tEnthusiasm and hope, I am afraid, are precisely what have been lacking till now, because in relations between States we do not always see any firm determination to turn our backs on the old demons of hegemonism, racism, selfishness and indifference, to embrace the notions of justice, solidarity, peace and collective security.\n108.\tExamples of this are legion. A year ago conflicts and tensions beset independent Africa. From north to south, from east to west, tragedy succeeded tragedy and whole populations, the victims of expansionist and interventionist ambitions, swelled the flood of refugees, the majority of whom are on our continent. While today Africa is enjoying a relative lull, the seeds of explosion remain, and we must not relax our vigilance.\n109.\tTherefore, the Upper Volta views with interest the important steps taken in the case of Western Sahara and hopes that they will lead to a just and lasting solution in keeping with the wishes of the peoples concerned. It would be a due reward for the efforts of the Organization of African Unity [OAU\\.\n110.\tThis is also the appropriate time for us to associate ourselves with Chad in expressing the ardent hope that that country will be helped in its efforts at reconstruction and unify, and that we will succeed in banishing forever the specter of fratricidal struggles and divisions sustained from outside.\n111.\tFor several years now, the question of Namibia has been an item on the agenda, and yet the Organization has not managed to ensure the exercise by the Namibian people of its right to self-determination and independence.\n112.\tFrom one resolution to another, from special sessions to contact groups, from the Geneva meeting, which in January 1981 ended in failure as a result of South Africa's maneuvers and the tolerant attitude of that country's Western allies, right up to the recent well-known initiatives, ground has very clearly, patently and worryingly\nbeen lost. Now the terms of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) have been set aside by the five countries of the contact group, which are taking refuge in a vague demand for an \\\"internationally acceptable settlement\\\".\n113.\tTo the Upper Volta, an acceptable international settlement is one which leads to immediate independence, which recognizes the SouthWest Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people, which preserves and protects the territorial integrity of Namibia as an indivisible State, including Walvis Bay, as well as the Penguin Islands and the other islands off the Namibian coast.\n114.\tIn the face of the deviousness and arrogance of South Africa and the passivity, amounting at times to complicity, on the part of some Members of the Organization, the Upper Volta has no choice but to encourage SWAPO in its just struggle for liberation. There can be no peace without justice ideals of the Organization to which my country is deeply attached.\n115.\tHowever, it is with some bitterness that we note the persistent and increasing assistance given by the West in the perpetuation of the Pretoria regime's abominable policy of segregation and repression.\n116.\tDay after day, Africa ceaselessly calls on those very countries which pride themselves on their age-old civilizations and traditions of respect for human rights to cast off their blinkers, to face the facts and prevent people from torturing and murdering others because of their color.\n\n117.\tIn spite of the repeated warnings of the international community, South Africa, pursuing its odious policy of segregation in Azania and Namibia, no longer has any hesitation in threatening the security of States which in the name of justice and in accordance with the ideals of the Charter give assistance and refuge to the movements fighting for the dignity and the liberation of man.\n118.\tSo South Africa, instead of tackling the true causes of the problems born of its policy of apartheid and colonial domination, has chosen rather to send its racist hordes into Angola to burn and destroy, without the international community taking immediate measures which are necessary to put an end to this barbarous aggression.\n119.\tThe constant and repeated violations of international law by the racist Pretoria regime stem from the passivity, if not the actual complicity, of certain great Powers. The determination of those Powers, accompanied by consistent action, would be a much better contribution to the search for peace and justice than their purely ritual and \\\"ineffectual protestations.\n120.\tPeace based on justice cannot be brought about within a framework of aggression, domination, any kind of discrimination, denial of the right of peoples to self determination, or denial of the principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.\n121.\tIs the West willing and is it able to understand that Africa has already done too much talking and that racist South Africa has already done too much humiliating , and torturing? Must the worst come to the worst before the supposedly civilized world realizes that it is necessary to\nAL.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \nimpose the proper solutions before it sees the martyred peoples of southern Africa succumbing totally and irremediably to hatred?\n122.\tWe therefore appeal urgently to the hearts and minds of men and nations of goodwill. There can be no negotiation with an executioner. What has to be done must be done before it is too late.\n123.\tIn its constant search for peace and justice the Upper Volta cannot remain indifferent to any positive attitude that would promote a settlement of the problems of southern Africa. That is why we welcome the declaration by France at the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, held in Paris, a declaration, unless we are much mistaken, that foreshadows a change in French policy regarding the Pretoria regime. Is there any need to remind representatives of the great importance of that first international conference on sanctions against South Africa? Our only wish is that the resolutions adopted there should not remain mere pious hopes and that the sanctions advocated there should not remain a dead letter but should be effectively and immediately put into effect in order to bring South Africa to its senses.\n124.\tSometimes painful, often explosive, the problem of the Middle East has taken a terrible toll in blood, tears, hatred and destruction. The martyred country of Lebanon, in spite of its heroic resistance, has become the plaything of forces which transcend it and are rending it asunder.\n125.. At the center of that tragedy we find the denial by Israel of the rights of the Palestinian people and its representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. Israel continues to believe that it can defy the international community by feeding the fires of controversy with unacceptable provocations and aggressions. The rending apart of Lebanon, the bombing of Tamuz and the refusal to consider the PLO as a party to a settlement of the conflict are all actions and attitudes that make the prospect of peace ever more distant. However, simple common sense should make Israel understand that it cannot always and in the face of everyone else be the only one to be always in the right. The same simple common sense should make Israel understand that its present policy is not the best one to guarantee its own interests and security.\n126.\tTwenty years ago the nonaligned movement was born, the expression of the wish of certain States to oppose the division of the world into two antagonistic camps. This refusal stemmed from their determination to seek a true international balance based on justice, independence, equality, peace and economic and social progress.\n127.\tConfident in this ideal, the Upper Volta wishes to reaffirm its devotion and adherence to the sacred principles of nonalignment and warns member countries against attempts to move us from the basic principles of the movement.\nX\n128.\tWith regard to those principles, we deplore the situation created in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, where clear interference by foreign Powers in the internal affairs of those countries has given rise to and is sustaining serious tension accompanied by the loss of human life and material destruction.\n129.\tSimilarly, the Upper Volta deplores and condemns what is happening in Latin America, where people are dying every day because they are claiming their right to dignity, freedom and wellbeing. Those men and women are dying because interests alien to their own countries have dictated it.\n130.\tThe question of Korea has always received the attention of my country, which has been working and calling for reconciliation between the two Koreas and their reunification. The Upper Volta appeals to them to find a peaceful solution in full independence, that is to say, without foreign intervention.\n131.\tThis brief survey does not encourage optimism because peace and security, which it is the task of the United Nations to bring about, seem to be objectives that are receding ever further into the future. How could it be otherwise when those very countries which under the Charter are charged with responsibility for security are themselves engaging in an unbridled arms race? We are witnessing, powerless, the revival of what should be known as the balance of terror. The sophistication of arms and their cost, paradoxically, are taking us ever further away from the necessary concerted effort to bring about true disarmament. The wasting of resources on death and destruction when they should be put to much better use is an affront to the poor and the needy of the world. There are forces at work trying to accustom us to a concept of conflict, of a division of the world between East and West, North and South, when the simple fact of the matter is that three quarters of mankind are suffering from poverty and misery.\n132.\tThe Upper Volta considers these attempts to be blows against the dignity and the survival of that part of humanity that is suffering from hunger.\n133.\tWe can never stress too much the fact that without concerted political will, without a massive input of resources and technology to accelerate a structural transformation of the poor countries and without a revision of priorities, economic recession, inflation, unemployment, a decline in purchasing power, deterioration in the terms of trade and food insecurity will continue to Widen the gap between the world of conspicuous and wasteful consumption and the world of misery and poverty.\n134.\tThe praiseworthy efforts of the Arab countries in their policy of cooperation with the African nations and the meritorious endeavors of so many specialized agencies might then be insufficient to prevent this kind of confrontation. Thus, the readjustment of relations between the North and the South, those global negotiations which were expected to lead to a true new economic order are for the time being deadlocked, which is a contradiction to the very notion of international cooperation.\n135.\tThose difficulties, which we would describe as a deterioration in the terms of dialog, have recently been exposed again at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris, not because there was any lack of will to approach the true problems facing that group of countries which are particularly underdeveloped, but because the determination to impose solutions was lacking. It was in fact a perpetuation of the spirit of Manila, namely, the refusal of the industrialized countries to come as quickly as possible to the assistance of the least developed countries by means of a massive inflow of resources and technology in order to effect their structural transformation. At this moment we are undoubtedly going through one of the gravest economic crises that the world has ever known. Undoubtedly, economic recession, inflation, unemployment, declining purchasing power, and growing energy costs are the same phenomena that we can observe everywhere, but invoking those phenomena is nothing but an attempt to conceal from us the lack of solidarity which is today having such an effect on international relations.\n136.\tIn such a context, where the obstacles and difficulties are varied and complex, the Upper Volta has naturally chosen to fight, to rehabilitate itself in all respects, and to break once and for all with the glibness and equivocation of the past in order to build and consolidate a truly progressive economy and a society by rationally and methodically exploiting its resources, both material and human. It is within that framework that the program of the Military Committee for National Recovery and Progress finds its meaning. It is within that framework that the objectives it has laid down can be properly appreciated by our partners in the international community, who, of course, share with us this vision of a world without complacency, where self-motivated effort is the true driving force to bring about food self-sufficiency, a rapid improvement in the living conditions of the broad masses, rational development of the industrial and mining sector, and a broadening of horizons and a sincere opening to the outside world.\n137.\tWe think objectively that on the basis of those broad guidelines, our program of action will achieve the following concrete results: in terms of food production, a substantial increase in grain tonnage, from 1.1 million at present to 2.6 million by 1990; in terms of geological prospecting and mining, an increased effort at research, diversification and exploitation of our resources, among which we include so-called strategic minerals; in terms of infrastructure, an expansion of our road, rail and air networks, which will make it possible for us fully to play our role as a crossroads in the subregion; in terms of energy, the construction of hydroelectric dams to reduce the disadvantages inherent in our considerable dependence on other countries, thus reducing the operation costs of our production and processing units; and, finally, in terms of regional solidarity and international cooperation, a more important role as a responsible partner capable of making a contribution to the building of a new world.\n138.\tThat program is ambitious on more than one count, but we remain convinced that, conceived and worked out in terms of our determination to rely on Ourselves, it can and it should, in that regard, win the encouragement and understanding that we are entitled to expect from the international community.\n139.\tThat is why we feel that enthusiasm and hope can be found in true international cooperation and no longer\nis outmoded and lethal concepts of sterile hegemonistic confrontation, misguided isolationism, and camouflaged egoism and indifference.\n140.\tFor my country, which is among the least developed of the developing countries, a tangible and unequivocal manifestation of that concerted determination to\nj make international cooperation the only path to salvation would, in our view, be the immediate revival of a true NorthSouth dialog. In that context, the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held at Cancun, should succeed in easing respective positions and conflicts of all sorts in order to make possible a calm resumption of global negotiations; and the rapid implementation of the Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, which was the subject of the recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.\n141.\tIn spite of results which did not fully satisfy the hopes that had been raised, we remain convinced that those industrialized countries which still hesitate to increase their public aid for development will ultimately come to understand the need for international solidarity and interdependence among States. The indispensable basis for the collective security that all the nations assembled here so ardently desire.\n142.\tIf in fact the Marshall Plan, the Colombo Plan and other rescue plans of the same scale had not been rapidly put into effect to come to the assistance of certain nations sorely tried by the last world conflict, many of those nations which are today economically powerful would undoubtedly be prey to those same tragedies that are affecting the least developed countries today.\n143.\tThus, in the economic crisis which the world is experiencing today, a crisis aggravated by the uncertainties of tomorrow, notions of solidarity, cooperation and aid can no longer be analyzed solely in terms of generosity, charity or pity, but rather in terms of moral obligation and a common determination to survive. To put into effect, on the model of the Marshall Plan, a plan to help the least developed countries find the path to salvation should be based on such an appreciation of the situation.\n144.\tIn conclusion, I should like to repeat that in today's world, where economic difficulties are so severe that they constitute a serious threat to stability and peace, where on all sides we see the development of violence and blind terrorism, it is important that all men of goodwill more than ever before combine their efforts to bring about a triumph for the ideals of the Charter. The Upper Volta, for its part, is ready to make its own modest contribution to that collective endeavor without which humanity will inevitably court disaster.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n48.\t Mr. President, it was my privilege to convey to you from this rostrum the congratulations and best wishes of the group of African States, which I represented on the day you were elected, as well as the congratulations of my own country. I particularly expressed at that time Algeria's deep satisfaction with this choice, a tribute both to a fraternal country and to a highly esteemed person. It is indeed, a great pleasure for me to reiterate our satisfaction today.\n49.\tThe general debate which marks the opening of each of these sessions provides us with an opportunity to draw up a critical balance sheet of past action. Through the dynamic process of comparing ideas, it calls upon us to demonstrate the necessary collective ambition for major efforts, and to ensure that it becomes a reality. This year once again one conclusion must be drawn: the situation is serious and entails great risks.\n50.\tIn an extremely sombre international atmosphere, there are abundant reasons for concern. Anxiety is rooted in the hearts of men and societies. The confusion of some, the anguish of others, the poverty of the majority, claim our attention from all corners of the world. It is indeed a global crisis that is facing our world.\n51.\tThis crisis is fed by a large number of conflicting power relationships. It is increasing the gap between the affluence of a small number of countries and the poverty suffered by the vast majority of mankind. World disorder and the absurdity of the present system of international economic relations are strikingly apparent. To have the strength and the will to act, we must first try to understand.\n52.\tIt is appalling when this indifferent world is told that, in less than two decades from now, we shall have to find the means of life, employment and food for 2 billion people, the equivalent to give a striking illustration of 2,000 cities with 1 million inhabitants each. The mind reels when we invert this line of reasoning and see that with the way the world is going, those 2 billion people will be doomed to perish in less than two decades. Our understanding and our awareness seem to have become so anesthetized that we seem no longer able to react to what is inconceivable today, but is the horrifying reality of tomorrow.\n53.\tIt has being estimated that in 1980 50 million human beings died of hunger a worldwide holocaust resulting in no outburst of collective indignation. It took the Second World War five years to achieve that macabre result. One may legitimately speak of non-assistance to endangered peoples, when more than $500 billion are spent annually on armaments throughout the world, and when the report Global 2000, produced by a commission established by Jimmy Carter, informs us that the quantity of cereals needed to eradicate malnutrition throughout the world has a value equivalent to the price of only five submarines.\n54.\tIn the year 2000, practically 1 billion people will be living below the absolute poverty line a scientific euphemism which is far from describing everything that that subhuman condition means.\n55.\tThe foreign debt of the developing world exactly equals the amount spent on arms each year by a human society which seems unable to imagine its own future, unless it be to waver between a boundless fascination with destruction and the irresistible temptation to commit collective suicide. It is a striking fact that the increase in this indebtedness is not, as one might imagine, the logical result of economic development but results simply from debt servicing costs, which in 1981 will surpass the staggering figure of $100 billion.\n56.\tShould there not be an effort to explain how, contrary to misleading appearances, the industrial nations receive in reverse aid from the proletarian nations almost seven times the amount that they invest there?\n57.\tHigh interest rates are a heavy burden on our fragile economies. A merciless trade war is being waged against our exports. The restructuring of world industry is at the discretion of transnational corporations, at the whim of their strategies and their profits. In an unequal confrontation, our countries cannot even control the abuses of the system. The international monetary system is completely destroying what we are so laboriously building.\n58.\tAt a time when the world structure is revealing inherent flaws, the importance that is finally being attached to international economic relations should be accompanied by an examination of conscience. That would have the merit of placing development and peace not only in their relationship of cause and effect, but in a close dialectical relationship which shows them to be interdependent. There can be no peace without development and no development without peace. Peace and development will be the characteristic features of the Identikit portrait of the new international relations so ardently desired by the international community.\n59.\tIn denouncing the iniquities on which the present system of international relations is based, the countries of the third world have underlined the fundamental truth that development is indeed the new name for peace. Like war, underdevelopment is not inevitable. It is the product of an organized system of domination and exploitation. By its very nature, this system thwarts the prospects for prosperity of two thirds of mankind. It denies their legitimate right to development. Furthermore, it generates insecurity, even for those who built the system. Creating frustration and alienation, the prevailing system is the negation of peace.\n60.\tWe have already said that there is no peace without development, but development has its rules certainly not those, recently reinstated, of the market economy.\n61.\tThe regressive note which can be discerned in the philosophy underlying international economic cooperation causes us concern. New ideas in the global approach to the problem of development are in many ways disquieting. The virtues of bilateralism arc praised for ulterior motives with which we are all familiar. A whole series of proposals has been built up on the basis of the concept of individual cooperation founded on political and strategic considerations. Today we also hear praise of the free play of private market forces as a means both of restarting growth and ensuring development.\n62.\tIt must be said that the present world crisis a structural crisis, above all has been engendered precisely by the uncontrolled and unforeseeable actions of those private enterprise forces. In a system characterized by inequality of opportunity and of the means of development, the free play of market forces heightens dependency and the spread of underdevelopment.\n63.\tThe laws of the market and of competition are manipulated to serve the interests of major world capital and transnational corporations. The facile glorification of these laws is a result of mystification. Liberalism is a doctrine developed by the powerful and the strong. The free, spontaneous and beneficent functioning of the natural laws of the market is a grim illusion.\n64.\tThese are the realities. The market economy is at the end of its tether. It completely fails to take into account the complexity of economic interdependence and the profound aspirations of the human being to more freedom and more humanity. The world economy is not a blind movement of objects and things. The natural laws of the market, in their anarchic haphazardness, are themselves condemned, as they in their turn condemn to failure growth per se, liberal growth, that which alienates man as a producer and as a consumer and which downgrades his social environment and his natural environment.\n65.\tTo give free reign to private actors in the world economy is tantamount to allowing them to develop according to their own rationality, that which prompts them to acquire even greater power, which is the very negation of international cooperation. Therefore how can we acquiesce in allowing the lives of billions of persons to be played with in this way, how can we agree to allow the future of the globe to be left to the uncertain vicissitudes of chance through the liberal laws of laissez-faire in this great world casino in which the great majority of inhabitants of the world are deprived? In this very dubious operation, the winners themselves will in fact gain only a Pyrrhic victory for, in the final analysis, our entire planet will be the loser in this immense game with marked cards.\n66.\tI need hardly add that we find very suspicious this strong recommendation we are being given to create in our own countries political and material conditions which will make it possible for transnational corporations to operate freely there. Are these to be the agents of our development, as has been suggested to us? At least we may be permitted to have doubts on that score. Since we have long suffered exploitation by a system of which we form part as the objects of the market, the countries of the third world are well aware that the transnational corporations could hardly today give up their vocation, ignore their strategic objective, their profit motive, and work for their own destruction.\n67.\tToday we are being reminded of the virtues of self reliance. Self-reliance is part of ourselves and undoubtedly the most demanding part. It is indeed the affirmation of our identity. It is the expression of our becoming responsible for the aspirations of our peoples. Finally, as we are aware, it is the inevitable and only way to national reconstruction. But what weight can be given to such a national mobilization for development if the international environment itself impedes it and nullifies its effects through the laws of a worldwide jungle? \n68.\tThis paradox has to be removed. The free interplay of the so-called natural market laws may well result in an exacerbation of the feeling of frustration that is felt by the starving masses. The paradox is that such laws organize anarchy, as it were, and at the same time are fraught with violence. The paradox is that, in the course of the fight against man's alienation, they themselves become transformed into actual manufacturers of violence. Thus, they are not by any means the appropriate remedy for the problems we are experiencing, for it is impossible to combat anarchy with anarchy; it is impossible to eliminate violence by bringing about even more violence.\n69.\tIn fact, the world crisis is so profound that a reinstatement of the so-called natural market laws as a panacea would produce a ridiculous situation. There is a pressing need for development. Undoubtedly what is required is more than a simple glorification of the merits of laissez-faire. We prefer responsible dialog to the vain rehabilitation of archaic liberalism. Global negotiations are an integral part of such dialog. We want such dialog; we believe in it. As we see it, it is both the condition and the means of orderly work directed towards collective wellbeing.\n70.\tThis necessary dialog is not only something that is made imperative by the world crisis; it represents for mankind a gamble on the future. It is an act of faith. For that reason, its outcome is of historic importance. It is the work of 'building of peace.\n71.\t*\tIn this context, we regret that the global negotiations have not yet been started. We reaffirm our support for such negotiations because we believe in their worth. Through these global negotiations, by means of dynamic, concerted action, a restructuring process to serve the interests of all could be undertaken. It is our hope that at the Cancun meeting, the necessary political impulse will be given to the initiation of such a process.\n72.\tThere can be no development without peace. If the process of development is the desired culmination of efforts for peace, an improvement of the international political climate is quite obviously an essential stage in that process.\n73.\tThere can be no doubt that international relations during the past two decades have undergone a qualitative evolution which can be seen in terms of the relative relaxation of tension between the major blocs and in the striking achievements of the liberation movements of peoples; but it remains true that the foundations for peace have not been solidly laid.\n74.\tThe persistent manifestations of a spirit of confrontation and the increasing number of hotbeds of tension in the third world can be seen to be rooted in the very logic of a system which spawns, crisis while at the same time trying to maintain it below the level of general conflagration.\n75.\tThe policy of spheres of influence, the doctrines of intervention based on a so-called vital interest, the installation or reactivation of military bases and the formation and deployment of armed forces for rapid intervention are all part of a firm desire to make the countries of the third world sites for the application of the global strategies directed fundamentally at the independence of those countries and their legitimate aspirations to peace.\n76.\tThe resurgence of gunboat policies and the feverish search for positions of strength are accompanied by efforts to block disarmament negotiations and to call into question freely contracted commitments in the field of arms control. Furthermore, the refinements of the technology of death have today given rise to a new weapon of mass destruction which, we are aghast to learn, is designed to kill men while leaving equipment intact. The production of the neutron bomb sheds a harsh light on the tragic absurdity in which technological civilization has gone astray; the consecration of things in a spirit of contempt for life.\n77.\tSuch an initiative is part of the spirit which underlies that concept of the readiness to use arms to protect security. It can only add fuel to the arms race and further impede the effective pursuit of the major objective of general and complete disarmament, the ultimate and absolute guarantee of the principle of the non-use of force.\n78.\tThe deterioration of the international political climate is part and parcel of the intrinsic logic of the system, even if the phenomenon of detente might have led us to believe, at one time, because of the promises of indivisibility which it gave us, in a dynamic spreading of a wave of peace which would extend its benefits to ever broader spheres of international relations.\n79.\tSince it has not generated any such dynamic flow, particularly in the third world, detente has revealed all the limits of its role in history.\n80.\tFrom the geostrategic standpoint, the third world is covered with relay States and hotbeds of tension. This tends to perpetuate the subjugation of peoples. The attempts to distort the basic nature of the Palestinian, Namibian and South African problems are aimed at containing the upsurge of the peoples' liberation movement by trying to make it appear in an EastWest context with which it is in no way concerned.\n81.\tIn the Middle East, the deterioration of the situation which arose as a result of the Camp David agreements has now entered a crucial phase. At the present time, we see increased manifestations of the aggressiveness of the Zionist entity directed against the Palestinian people and other peoples of the region. The repeated acts of aggression against martyred Lebanon, which is thus threatened with criminal dismemberment, the bombing of Iraq's nuclear installations which were set up for peaceful purposes, the unbridled repression of the Arab populations of the occupied territories all that allows us to gauge the very strange concept of peace which, from the outset, was intended solely to liquidate the cause of the Palestinian people and reshape the entire Middle East for foreign purposes. In that respect, the strategic cooperation which has just become official doctrine is fraught with danger for .that sorely tried region.\n82.\tAs long as the Palestinian people are not enabled to exercise their national rights, as long as a genuine process of peace has not been initiated, with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, its sole and legitimate representative, any attempt at a solution which is not mindful of the origin of that crisis and merely dwells on its manifestations will be pointless. \n83.\tIn southern Africa, the Pretoria regime, through its practice of apartheid, its illegal occupation of Namibia and its acts of aggression against States in that region, is seriously damaging the United Nations by undermining its foundations and defying its authority.\n84.\tThe eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly will undoubtedly have strengthened the international consensus on the need for the immediate independence of Namibia on the basis of the strict implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), applied in its entirety. That consensus must prevail. It must bring about the independence of Namibia which will be the culminating point in the heroic struggle of its people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SMP0], its sole authentic representative.\n85.\tThe same battle must be waged against apartheid, the most retrograde and unacceptable system.\n86.\tWhether overt or potential, other crises need to be resolved. Whether it be Afghanistan, the IranIraq conflict, Korea or Cyprus, full and frank dialog is the preferred way to promote political solutions through which, in accordance with international norms, the rights of each individual to live in peace and dignity will prevail.\n87.\tIn the context of the tireless efforts which have been made by OAU, the eighteenth session of its Assembly of Heads of State and Government has defined the elements of a just and final settlement of the question of Western Sahara [see AI36I534, annex II, resolution AHG/Res.103 (XVIII)].\n88.\tIn deciding to organize and hold a general and free referendum on self-determination among the people of Western Sahara and to work towards bringing about a ceasefire, and in creating the Implementation Committee for that purpose, the African Heads of State intended to make every effort to achieve the final decolonization of that Territory. This desire to put back on the rails that process which had long been impeded and to bring it to completion can be seen through the intricate machinery which was defined by the Implementation Committee, such as the establishment of an impartial interim administration, the constitution of an international peacekeeping force and the imposition of a ceasefire by both parties to the conflict by means of negotiations undertaken under the auspices of the Implementation Committee [see A/36/512, annex].\n89.\tThe direct responsibility and the authority of the Implementation Committee in carrying out that process, as well as the involvement of the United Nations in bringing it about, are the best guarantees that it will be properly conducted.\n90.\tHere I wish to pay a tribute to the OAU and to the Heads of the States members of its Implementation Committee for their laudable efforts with a view to a solution which will be freely determined. Algeria, whose position on that question is the same as that of the OAU and of the United Nations, can only reaffirm its availability to help both belligerent parties, Morocco and the POLISARIO Front, to undertake full and frank negotiations with a view to establishing a ceasefire in order to create the required impetus for the establishment of peace.\n91.\tPeace is the precondition for development. However, it is by no means sufficient in itself. Peace and development are inseparable and must be part of a clear-sighted and ambitious perception of a future for mankind which is characterized by solidarity. It is precisely that perception of the world which the non-aligned movement brings before the international community.\n92.\tThis year, our movement is celebrating its twentieth anniversary. It bears within itself the aspirations of mankind to peace and progress. It invites us collectively to devote ourselves, through democratic dialog, to the task of rationally planning the new political and economic space of our times.\n93.\tThat undertaking has peace and development as its key words. It requires that the unjust and tension-producing structures of the present system of international relations be replaced by an egalitarian order, built with the assistance of all and for the benefit of all. It is designed to promote an international order which would be an authentic product of universal civilization and a common intellectual effort to ensure the common good.\n94.\tThe dialog which the third world is today proposing takes on the connotation of an historic dialog; dialog which will generate a universal era of peace; peace which will enable each people to take charge of its own affairs and which will make of our planet a true land of men.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Many years ago, I proposed in the Assembly that policy statements should be limited to 20 to 25 minutes. I have attempted and will attempt today to do that. The full text of my speech will be distributed to members of the Assembly. I have an abridged version which I will deliver, and the. reading time\u2014I ask members to look at their watches will not exceed 20 minutes. I hope that this will be emulated by subsequent speakers. We waste too much time in long speeches, when I believe that the full texts can be distributed to the members, who can read them at their leisure in their rooms or apartments.\n3.\tMy delegation is pleased to join our colleagues in congratulating you, Mr. President, and the country which you so ably represent, and in paying a tribute to your wealth of experience and proved diplomatic skill. Having served as an international civil servant in a high capacity, you have an unrivaled knowledge of the vast machinery of the United Nations, a knowledge that we are sure you will share with us in our deliberations during this session.\n4.\tI acknowledge gratefully your kind reference to me in your opening remarks following your election [1st meeting]. I can only say that if during my term as President, in 1949, I had had even a small portion of your mastery of the workings of the Assembly, and if I were younger, I would consider running for President again when Asia's turn next comes round.\n5.\tOur congratulations also go to the outgoing President, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar. He ran the Assembly with exemplary efficiency and punctuality which we must learn to emulate at this session and imparted much of his wisdom in the solution of the numerous difficulties which beset the past session, especially in his pioneer work on global negotiations. In his eloquent valedictory address [ibid.], the best ever delivered by any outgoing President of the General Assembly, including myself, he left us a great deal of food for thought and profitable lessons for us all.\n6.\tIn the last 10 years we have noted the changing tone and color of the relations among nations. Periodic crises, often low-key but more frequently of an emergency character, have continued to occur in the world. Many of these have been solved by time, like a wound that heals itself. But many more remain persistent and chronic, rising and falling in severity in accordance with the unpredictable global political climate.\n7.\tToday we know that these crises create a cumulative impact. At a particular point in time the problems converge and generate intolerable pressures seemingly beyond our power to control. The prospect of a new world order built on the acceptance of reciprocal interests leading to peace, justice and security for all has been an illusory fabric, too frail to bear the burden of our deepest hopes.\n8.\tWe derive a measure of optimism from the fact that in the past we have managed our problems in a way that has kept the world on a reasonably even keel. But it is quite evident that the \\\"windows of opportunity\\\" for promoting a stable world order based on tacitly accepted norms of international conduct are at this moment firmly shut. Unless we can reopen those windows and it is our task to do so we should all very much fear that, against our will, we shall be writing a prescription for global disaster.\n9.\tWhy have we reached this dark passage in the history of our time? I suggest that behind the great issues of arms control, the apparently insoluble dilemmas in the Middle East and the issues of Afghanistan and Kampuchea lie profound psychological causes.\n10.. The following elements, among many others, have obvious causal connections with our failure to move ahead. One is deep seated fears and suspicions. A second is an ineradicable feeling of insecurity. A third is lack of confidence in the viability of a world order capable of sustaining longterm stability. And a fourth is over-dependence on the luck of the gambler for the sake of particular interests.\n11. It would be ideal to suggest that the foregoing elements the hidden and unrecognized causes that move men and nations to action could be eradicated by a simple act of will. But they can be mitigated by open dialog or, in a word, by communication. It is one of the\nironies of our time that, on a planet shrunk by unbelievable technological advances in communication, the one thing that we have been unable to solve is the act of communication among men in order to bridge the mysterious gap, which can lead to understanding.\n12.\tThe practical consequences of this lack of communication affect all of us and form the main burden of the deliberations of this session. It is in this context that we must view the ominous signs of the revival of the arms race, especially the infinitely sophisticated new generation of nuclear weapons with the power to destroy the world many times over. The efforts to establish an agreed ceiling on the most lethal nuclear arms remain deadlocked, a situation which enlarges the factor of uncertainty and further encourages even higher levels of nuclear weapon development.\n13.\tMany times in this forum, we have raised our voices in apprehension that the unimaginable horrors of nuclear war will be visited on mankind with profit to none and loss to all, including those with the power to unleash the weapons of apocalypse. In this grave situation, we must again appeal to the great Powers to begin conversations within a framework which will permit the resumption of agreements on mutually acceptable limitations of nuclear weapons. The longer the delay on this most critical issue, the greater are the chances that the rising level of tension will escalate to unacceptable proportions and thus ignite a conflagration which, without question, will incinerate the entire planet.\n14.\tIn this connection, my delegation wishes to invite the attention of the Assembly to the wide-ranging report of the SecretaryGeneral on the work of the Organization [A/36/1]. In his customary fashion, the SecretaryGeneral has drawn for us a faithful picture of our times, full of sharp insights into the human condition and all encompassing in his range of vision. Only he, as a seasoned diplomat and with his long experience as SecretaryGeneral, could have given us such a statesmanlike report, which should be translated into all languages in order to give the world a correct overall appraisal of the contemporary condition of human kind.\n15.\tOn the subject of the arms race, for example, the Secretary-General has the following to say in his unchallengeable analysis. I hope that the superPowers will listen to him. He says:\n\\\"What is called the problem of the arms race is in reality a complex of problems. The largest single factor fueling the worldwide arms buildup has for a long time been the hostility between East and West. After a period of relative relaxation, the relations between the superPowers are again going through a period of tension, and there are clear indications of a sharply intensified upward spiral in their arms buildup.\\\" [Ibid, sect. V.]\n16.\tThose are wise words, words of alarm, words that should alert all of Us. The Secretary General continues a little later:\n\\\"From their first appearance in history, the existence of nuclear weapons added a new and frightening dimension to the potentialities for world catastrophe. While the governments concerned have rightly expressed their extreme aversion to using such weapons, their very existence in the tense context of greatPower relationships constitutes an unprecedented threat to human society and civilization.\\\" [Ibid.]\nThose are the words of the SecretaryGeneral warning the superPowers. He continues:\n\\\"In international affairs, confusion, confrontation and emotion cannot accurately be foreseen, forestalled or controlled, and a nuclear war would be both devastatingly quick and conclusive'. If the present nuclear arms race among the most powerful States is the greatest potential danger threatening mankind, a similar race between additional nuclear States will add immeasurably to that danger and to the risk of the actual use of nuclear weapons.\\\" [Ibid.]\n17.\tThose are words of warning from the man who has been leading us all this time.\n18.\tUntil this issue is resolved, further forward movement on general disarmament in the longer term will be impeded and may indeed put at issue once more the limited gains in the area of collateral measures achieved after lengthy and protracted endeavors. Time is not on our side. We should make every effort to maintain the momentum which can lead to meaningful results in the proposed conference on disarmament to be held early next year.\n19.\tThe spiraling arms race has an obvious connection with the other great issues that face the world today, and which the SecretaryGeneral also emphasizes. I refer to the NorthSouth dialog. In his farewell address to the. Assembly, the outgoing President, Mr. von Wechmar, called attention to the fact that if only 5 per cent of the budget for military expenditures were diverted to economic development, it would provide a solution to the stagnant world economy, particularly the economies, of the developing countries [1st meeting, para. 13]. This sage observation underscores the need to curb the vast sums spent for military hardware and weapons development. The new economics of war preparedness conflicts with the global demand for higher standards of living and for the even more urgent task of eradicating poverty everywhere. Abundant proof exists that the increasing capacity to wage war not only endangers peace but also dissipates international wealth.\n20.\tI suggest that this situation is not worth the price that it entails, for it involves grinding poverty and social and political instability, with their predictable adverse consequences for world peace. Many less developed countries are engaged in massive and sustained national efforts to promote growth and eradicate poverty. But a deteriorating external environment for development will make these efforts increasingly difficult, if it does not frustrate them altogether. We wish to emphasize that this is not a one-way street. We must recognize the changed nature of interdependence. The problems of the poor and the rich impinge on each other and cause grave difficulties for both.\n21.\tIn the report of the World Bank in 1981, the developing countries are described as \\\"engines of growth\\\" in the world economy. The report makes two important points. Firstly, an increment of 1 per cent in the rate of\ngrowth of developing countries would generate significant increases in the developed world. Secondly, the sustained development efforts by the developing countries prevented serious recession and widespread unemployment in the industrialized countries. In our view, this is the operational meaning of interdependence.\n22.\tYet the continued depressed condition of the world economy is not necessarily inevitable. Policy choices in key areas fall within the political range of international decision-making. For this reason we look forward with cautious optimism to the informal exchange of views at the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held next month. It may and could provide the needed political will to launch the long-delayed global round of negotiations at this session of the Assembly.\n23.\tHaving dealt with those two paramount issues, I turn now to problems of a regional character.\n24.\tThe events of the past year in the Middle East suggest a setback in the continuing efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the interlocking problems which beset the region. In OUJ: view, the most important single element is the question of Palestinian self-determination. Unless and until Israel modifies its unyielding stand on this issue, violence will continue to rack that part of the world. Israel has a legitimate concern for its security, and the Palestinians must recognize this, but Israel's reactions transcend the limits of that concern. Israel must accept that it cannot aspire to be the paramount power in the region; a just solution requires, within the boundaries of security for all, an equal partnership in peaceful endeavors.\n25.\tSimilar conditions afflict Namibia in southern Africa. It is difficult, in the light of the negotiations of the last few years, to interpret South Africa's intransigent position as anything but delaying tactics to enable it to perpetuate its occupation of Namibia. My delegation is prepared to support once again any initiative by the General Assembly to secure the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the subject and for the imposition of sanctions on South Africa within a specified time-frame.\n26.\tWithin South Africa itself, the racist policies remain unchanged. But it is a measure of the increasingly bold opposition by that country's black majority that violence has demonstrably increased in the past year. The radicalization of oppressed elements is a natural consequence of unceasing repression. South Africa should not be surprised if it finds itself increasingly besieged from within and from without.\n27.\tIn Afghanistan, the prospects for solution remain dim. The Soviet Union has consistently rejected the beginnings of a dialog which could at the least create a framework within which negotiations could take place, leading to the withdrawal of Soviet forces and the exercise of self-determination by the Afghan people. There is no other rational solution to a problem which correctly concerns the whole world, not only because it violates the\n0 Charter of the United Nations, but also because it has extensive ramifications which could in time involve other areas of Asia and the Middle East. In the meantime, the Soviet Union is paying an unexpectedly high price in supporting a satellite regime which does not have the support of the Afghan people. For the rest of the world, the violation of the sovereign rights of an independent people by the use of naked force is gross misconduct from which it cannot and should not avert its eyes.\n28.\tThe situation in Kampuchea continues to be a matter of very serious concern. The spurious claims of the restoration of stability in that war-torn county are not borne out by the facts. They are false. The situation remains a threat to the peace of the whole of SouthEast Asia, to all of us in SouthEast Asia.\n29.\tEarlier this summer, the International Conference on Kampuchea was convened under the auspices of the United Nations. The major result was a Declaration unanimously adopted by the Conference.1 The Conference agreed that the key to the Kampuchean problem lies in a comprehensive political settlement. With this end in view, the Declaration calls for negotiations based on four major elements.\n30.\tIt continues to be a matter of regret that Viet Nam and its friends chose to avoid the Conference. The elements for negotiations were offered in openhanded and sincere fashion, and to all observers they were most reasonable ones. But Viet Nam continues to entertain the fiction that the Kampuchean problem lies outside the purview of the United Nations and that therefore any action which the United Nations might take is, in their words, illegal. This is an untenable proposition. We once again invite Viet Nam to come forward and begin considering serious steps to solve a problem which has increased world instability and caused Viet Nam itself great difficulties.\n31.\tIn another part of Asia, an old problem which still remains a danger deserves fresh examination. Although the question of the reunification of Korea is not on the agenda of the Assembly, we should take note of the efforts of President Chun to revive the negotiations at the summit level. In view of the lack of response from the North, perhaps the already overburdened SecretaryGeneral could be persuaded in the interest of peace to use his good offices as a channel of communication. In the past we have supported the admission of the two Koreas into the United Nations if it would serve the interests of both. We do so again today.\n32.\tWe cannot stress too strongly our concern with the related issues of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Both involve the use of force and the repression of the right of their respective peoples freely to determine their own destiny. We cannot give our willing assent to flagrant violations of the Charter or ignore the danger to world peace inherent in these intolerable acts of aggression. My delegation appeals to everyone present in this Assembly to unite and, with one voice, to urge the parties concerned to return to the peaceful and orderly processes of settlement of the problems of Afghanistan and Kampuchea.\n33.\tTurning to another subject, my delegation views with deep regret the failure of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to adopt the convention on the law of the sea. Last year, it will be recalled, the Assembly acknowledged the nearly completed draft not only as being important in itself, but as being an example of how much the United Nations can achieve when the requisite will is present. Our expectations, unfortunately, proved to be premature but not, we hope, irremediable. We express the view of a majority in this forum that to reopen fundamental issues already decided by consensus over the span of a decade of arduous labor would amount to rejection of the draft convention. if\n34.\tThe importance of that convention cannot be overestimated. It is vital to peace and stability in the oceans. A clear determination of the extent of the sovereignty and jurisdiction of States over the waters of the seas is needed to avoid economic and political conflicts, and even military confrontations, caused by uncertainty. The orderly exploitation under an international regime of these rich nodules on the ocean floor is necessary to implement the principle that the resources of the seas outside national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind.\n35.\tThe failure of the Conference to conclude a universally accepted convention would be tragic, because the alternative is chaos in the regime of the seas. For the sake of humanity, all States must resolve to reach final agreement at the next session of the Conference. My delegation suggests that the Conference, scheduled for March and April 1982, should have enough leeway so that it can extend its eight week session by one or two weeks if necessary to complete its work.\n36.\tOn another important question, the Philippines reaffirms its firm commitment to the successful outcome of the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. The Charter, like every product of the human mind, is not immune from reform. It is not perfect. It must b dynamic and must adapt to the altered circumstances of a world in transition.\n37.\tThe Special Committee on the Charter has negotiated at length on the draft Manila declaration on the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the first tangible product of the Committee following many years of activity. We are hopeful that the draft will be completed and adopted at an early date, and that this will lead to further steps, including a treaty on the peaceful settlement of disputes, with binding obligations.\n38.\tThe task which confronts us at this session of the General Assembly is a formidable one. In nearly every comer of the world, potentials for danger exist, threatening to cancel out the patient work of the Organization on behalf of peace. This is a time of testing for the United Nations that will last for many years to come. In the face of grave crises we need to summon all the resources of courage and wisdom at our command, always keeping in view the great goal of achieving a better life for all in an environment of peace and justice.\n39.\tWe shall be guided, Mr. President, by your wise counsel, and we shall be fortified by the boundless patience and unsurpassed statesmanship of the Secretary General, who embodies in his own person the very qualities which have made the United Nations an indispensable tool for the solution of the grave problems which face us in times of crisis,\n"

        "file_text": " We should like the President to accept our sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to the exalted and responsible post of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n116.\tLet me also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, for the manner in which he presided over the proceedings of the thirty-fifth session.\n117.\tI wish to address our grateful appreciation to the SecretaryGeneral for his dedicated and unflagging efforts to strengthen international security and promote peaceful cooperation.\n118.\tAs a founder of the United Nations and an unswerving advocate of the liberation of all colonial and dependent peoples and countries, Poland welcomes its one hundred and fifty-fifth Member, the Republic of Vanuatu, and wishes its people every success in developing its statehood.\n119.\tThe thirty-sixth session is convening in the first year of a new decade of efforts aimed at the implementation of the lofty purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The decade that ended last year will pass into the history of international relations as a period of painstaking, though not always successful, endeavors to improve the political atmosphere in the world and to develop a wide-ranging dialog and all around cooperation among nations, as a time of construction of the fabric of detente. It is precisely the efforts of the past and preceding decades which have justified the inclusion in the declaration of May 1980 of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty of the verdict that \\\"it has been possible to break the tragic cycle in which peace has been no more than a pause between world wars and to develop a broad effort to eliminate war forever from the life of human society.\n120.\tThe policy cf detente has brought tangible benefits to the whole world, to all States and peoples. It has proved above all that among the participants in the process of detente there are no losers, that within humanity's practical reach there lies the possibility not only of banishing and burying the spectrum of war, but also of embarking on specific action towards the just settlement of international disputes by means of negotiations and towards the development of equitable and mutually profitable cooperation between States with different social and political systems. We are greatly disturbed, however, that the world is entering its new decade in a qualitatively different situation, fraught with serious threats that impair many of the achievements of the seventies.\n121.\tContrary to the noble objectives of the current Second Disarmament Decade, the arms race continues unchecked. We are confronted with a situation in which it is becoming not only more intense, but also more universal. It constitutes the central problem of our times; it adversely affects the security of all States; it saddles national economies with a huge burden, especially in the case of those countries which are at this stage overcoming the effects of underdevelopment. Decisions concerning deployment of new medium-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe and the production of new kinds of nuclear arms, like the neutron weapons, offer a striking illustration of the intensification of the arms race.\n122.\tExtremely disturbing in present international relations are the attempts to revive the ill-famed policy based on strength. They are governed by a shortsighted logic, since the unequivocal message of the whole of the past 36 years is that in the present day world an imperialist policy based on strength is a throwback, both dangerous and risky. It undermines confidence in international relations. Its effect has been and still is to generate tensions which push humanity towards the quicksands of self-destruction.\n123.\tRegional and local conflicts continue to be a source of growing tensions. Not only have most of them remained unsolved thus far, but new flash points have appeared.\n124.\tThis unfavorable picture of the international situation also includes a stalemate in the implementation of the new international economic order. Attaining prompt agreement on effective measures to increase the rate of growth of the developing countries has become a particularly burning problem.\n125.\tIn the world of today, the connection between the establishment of peaceful relations on our planet and the requirements of the social and economic development of nations and of the whole international community is becoming clearer than ever. It rests on two crucial premises.\nFirst, that every nation and every human being has an inherent right to live in peace and that respect for this right is in the common interest of all mankind; secondly, that every nation and every human being is entitled to exercise, without hindrance, a natural right to development.\n126.\tRespect for these rights is especially important for us in Poland. In the recent historical past, their total violation resulted in a holocaust for millions of Poles, victims of barbarian Nazis. It took the great common victory over fascism, the transformations of the socialist system and our alliances to guarantee us a peaceful existence and to give us the chance to tackle the challenges of development in today's world.\n127.\tThe Polish delegation has arrived at the present session well aware of the necessity of firmly counteracting everything that worsens the international situation and ready to make an active contribution to the Organization's joint efforts to reverse world trends of negative development. We conceive of Poland's traditional involvement in molding peaceful relations in Europe and in the world at large also in the context of our efforts to surmount the serious problems and difficulties which our country is currently experiencing.\n128.\tI said from this rostrum at the previous session [10th meeting] that we are tackling and solving those problems with absolute openness and discretion, within the framework of our nation's indisputable record of accomplishment and in accordance with our principles, our socialist political system and the rule of law. We have remained faithful to this policy. It was reaffirmed in full by the Ninth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party last July and in the successive resolutions of the Polish Parliament. We shall firmly defend it against all anti-socialist internal threats, aided as they are at times from the outside.\n129.\tWe are aware that the situation in Poland is followed with keen interest in the world. We understand the concern and anxiety of our friends that we successfully overcome our difficulties, in the interest of strengthening socialist Poland as a steadfast member of the socialist community of States, in the interest of that community's strength and security, and as a stabilizing factor of peaceful order in Europe. All this is our common concern. We are grateful for the great * assistance and understanding which at this trying time we are receiving from our allies and friends, most of all the Soviet Union.\n130.\tWe highly appreciate the sympathetic approach to our problems of many States with which we have traditional ties of cooperation. It must, however, be noted that there are also forces which would wish to trade on events in Poland for purposes of discrediting socialism, undermining the cohesion of the community of socialist States, interfering in our internal affairs, fomenting tensions and justifying the arms race, for purposes of threatening international peace and security. To such forces our answer is a categoric \\\"No\\\". Poland needs peace, both internal and external. Poland will defend these supreme values consistently and with unyielding determination.\n131.\tPoland's present and future are inseparably bound up with socialism. This is also in keeping with the fundamental axioms of the Polish raison d'etat. It is only such a Poland, a socialist Poland\\\", a credible ally of its friends,\\\" that could and can make a constructive contribution to the cause of peaceful relations in Europe. For a stable Poland is an important and indispensable, factor of a stable Europe.\n132.\tThe quality of international relations depends and will continue to depend substantially on the state of SovietAmerican relations. Indeed, they represent an objective element of the relationship of forces and of the process of ensuring security in the contemporary world.\n133.\tPoland would welcome improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, It would be to the benefit not only of the two nations concerned, but also of the peaceful existence and cooperation of all nations. This is, in fact, the objective at which numerous Soviet initiatives are aimed.\n134.\tThe second requirement is intensification of positive action in the area of international security and disarmament. The experience of the past few years has. shown that fomenting distrust, the influence of the military industrial complexes, the argument that the armaments of the other side must be matched and, most recently, the highly dangerous doctrines of military superiority and the possibility of a limited nuclear war rob disarmament negotiations of their essential dynamism and effectiveness. What is needed, therefore, is the will and political perception of the imperative of real disarmament.\n135.\tWe view the following points as of special importance: the readiness to resume negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms and on medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe; the proposal for an agreement on widening the scope of confidence-building measures; and creative support for the idea of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in northern Europe. A significant means of limiting armaments would be the conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space. A proper platform for fundamental negotiations on the basic problems of the contemporary world might be created by a high-level meeting of members of the Security Council and possibly leaders of other interested States. It is with special attention that we have noted the important proposal contained in the statement made from this rostrum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Andrei Gromyko, concerning the adoption by the General Assembly of a declaration on preventing a nuclear catastrophe [7th meeting, para. 116]. Particularly noteworthy is the profoundly humanistic essence of the new initiative. We extend our full support to all these proposals.\n136.\tWe place considerable hope in the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. An appropriate contribution to a well prepared special session would be long awaited progress in the Committee on Disarmament, at Geneva, at least over the issues where it is being held up not so much by substantive disagreement as by the absence of the political will necessary for their successful resolution. We set great store by universalization and strict implementation of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, tied to guarantees of the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy.\n137.\tThere is an organic link between efforts on behalf of disarmament and international security and the principles of the Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace [General Assembly resolution 33/73], adopted three years ago on Poland's initiative. Time has borne out the total relevance of its principles. In conjunction with the review of its implementation that is to be made at the current session, the Polish delegation hopes there will be a constructive exchange of views serving to develop the lofty purposes and principles of the Declaration.\n138.\tThe third condition for a fairer outlook on the international horizon is the elimination of conflicts and focal points of tension. There is now an ominous prospect of a dangerous belief in the \\\"normality\\\" of wars taking root in the minds of societies and desensitizing them to human injustice and suffering. There is, therefore, in the first place, a very pressing need for discontinuing the imperialist policy based on strength, for rejecting hegemonism, and for eradicating the remnants of colonialism, neocolonialism and racism. The vast majority of current conflicts and crisis situations are precisely a direct product of these negative phenomena. They are also derived from failure to recognize the realities and historical processes.\n139.\tThis is the situation in the Middle East, where we still await a solution of the basic problem, that of assuring the Arab people of Palestine independent statehood. Until such time as this issue is made an integral part of a comprehensive rather than a separatist formula, attempts to ease tensions in this region will remain fruitless.\n140.\tThis is the situation in southern Africa, where a glaring example of neocolonialism has been the recent aggression by the racist regime in South Africa against Angola. We roundly condemn this brutal new step and support in full the decisions taken so far by the United Nations against the policies of apartheid and on the question of Namibia as summed up to resounding effect at the recently completed eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly.\n141.\tThis is the situation in SouthEast Asia, where the peoples of Indochina are plagued by nonrecognition of realities and interference in their internal affairs. They are revealingly disclosed in the absence from this Hall of the representatives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. In our Opinion, the solution to problems in this region must spring from the position of the Governments directly concerned. We therefore support the latest proposals of the three Indochinese States in this regard [see A/36/86, annexes I and //], which we find constructive.\n142.\tAs timely as ever remain the initiatives of the Government of Afghanistan regarding normalization of the situation in SouthWest Asia. They have our full support.\n143.\tI also voice our firm solidarity with the struggle of the Korean people for the settlement of the question of Korea on the basis of the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n144.\tOur growing concern is aroused by the mounting tide of international terrorism, both in its State form, as exemplified by the unprecedented Israeli attack on Iraqi nuclear installations, and in its individual manifestations.\nOur own countryman, head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II, has lately fallen victim to a terrorist. We rejoice in his complete return to health.\n145.\tFinally, there is the fourth, though not least important, factor in improving the climate in the world: establishing a new and just economic order and surmounting through joint efforts the crisis developments in international economic cooperation. Destructive attempts continue to be made to subordinate economic relations with other countries to political and strategic considerations. Equality, nondiscrimination and reciprocal benefit are the basic principles of a healthy world system of economic relations.\n146.\tTheir present condition has pinpointed with particular clarity the necessity of their restructuring, taking specific account of the interests of the developing countries, particularly the least developed ones. A creative role can and should be played here by global negotiations consistent with the progressive objectives of the new international economic order and the International Development Strategy. Focusing as it does all shades of interests and needs, the United Nations system is best equipped to meet these requirements. The sooner there begins to be an improvement in (the world political situation and the more tangible the effects of disarmament agreements in bettering standards of Hying, the more quickly can this goal be achieved.\n147.\tThe Organizations after all a mirror of the complicated condition of the surrounding world. This requires all the more a joint effort of all who are genuinely ready to strive to \\\"save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\" and who look upon the United Nations as indeed a \\\"center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends\\\".\n148.\tIt is with such an approach that the Polish delegation is participating in the thirty-sixth session. Stemming from the humanistic nature of the socialist system, our foreign policy has complete endorsement in the Charter of the United Nations. Even in periods of gravest tension we have patiently sought solutions and explored avenues to keep international dialog alive. We are following the same course today in spite of the domestic problems we are facing.\n149.\tTogether with its socialist allies, Poland has been unsparing in its efforts and perseverance with a view to improving the international climate, particularly on the continent in the heart of which we are situated. Europe is the common home of the peoples inhabiting it. Poland has been and will be among the pioneers of the struggle for peace, for European detente, security and cooperation. This accounts for the efforts we had made in convening the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and in the process of implementing the Final Act of the Conference. It also determines our stance at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe. For this same reason, we uphold the proposal discussed at the Madrid meeting of representatives of European and North American States to convene in Warsaw conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe. By the same token, we are actively participating in United Nations disarmament efforts. This, too, is the meaning of the appeal addressed by the Ninth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party to our partners in the West to increase the frank dialog in exploring ways of preventing cold war threats and safeguarding what has so far been accomplished by detente. It would represent a very appreciable contribution by Europe towards universalization of the processes of detente on a world scale.\n150. On a number of issues crucial to the world an ever growing role is being played by the active movement of the nonaligned States. We particularly appreciate the enormous efforts being made by the overwhelming majority of its members to preserve the authenticity and the progressive ideas of the movement.\n151.\tWe feel close to the just aspirations of the developing countries. Aside from our traditional solidarity with their struggle for full political and economic emancipation, we declare our readiness to cooperate on a partnership basis in all areas of mutual interest. In order to serve their further development we are ready to make available a substantial number of Polish experts and specialists. We positively view the endeavors of the many developing nations which treat social progress as an integral part of development.\n152.\tIn conclusion, I wish to express my strong belief that the current session will prove to be yet another attempt to strengthen the role of our Organization in the world. The extent to which it succeeds depends on all of us. Not so many years ago a session of the General Assembly could be counted a success only if there was no deterioration in the international climate in the course of its duration. Today, that is no longer enough. Let us therefore do everything in our power to see that the results of our proceedings measure up to the authentic ambitions and aspirations of our respective peoples for a secure and dignified life in peace.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka, I extend to you, Mr. President, our congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Our commitment to cooperating fully with you and our pleasure at your election are both manifest. We come from the same region of the world and me heirs to similar traditions. Our two nations view many international issues in the same perspective. More intimately, we are aware of your personal attributes. As fellow members of the nonaligned movement we have been able on numerous occasions to observe and take pleasure in your dedication to our founding principles and your skill. We are confident that those attributes will benefit the Assembly and, through it, the global community as a whole.\n41.\tThe nonaligned movement is now in its twentieth year. Next year, when it reaches the age of 21 an age associated with maturity in many societies our heads of State and Government are scheduled to meet at Baghdad. Therefore your country has an especially important role to play as we prepare for a renewal based on experience and understanding. For the three years following that meeting, your country will be chairman and coordinator of the movement. We have no doubt that your stewardship will help to strengthen the movement and its validity as a positive force in international relations. In this connection, we are pleased that, for the first time in the history of summit meetings attended by the heads of Government of seven industrialized countries, this year's economic Summit at Montebello, Canada, specifically referred to the significance of nonalignment. The concept and practice of nonalignment are being increasingly acknowledged as relevant and important.\n42.\tIn a very real sense, nonalignment will return to its roots when the movement holds its summit meeting in Asia once again next year. The first stirrings of Afro Asian independence in foreign policy were heard in Bandung in 1955. Six years elapsed between the Bandung Conference and the first Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held at Belgrade. Some of the countries represented at Bandung were not at Belgrade. But there was a continuity between Bandung and Belgrade, and for all of us in Sri Lanka it is a matter of pride that our capital, Colombo, the venue of the fifth Conference of the NonAligned Countries, is in many ways part of that continuity, which will be reaffirmed in Baghdad next year.\n43.\tIt was in Colombo that the word \\\"nonalignment\\\" entered the vocabulary of international politics. The word was used with a foreign policy connotation for the first time at the Colombo Powers Conference in 1954, which decided that the Bandung Conference should be held. With other participants at Colombo and Bandung and wi'Ji all others who have added strength to nonalignment through the years, swelling the movement's numbers, we have a special commitment to preserving the fundamental principles of nonalignment. Those principles are not to be looked at in the negative sense of fence-sitting. Rather, those principles have a profoundly positive connotation in that they permit adherents of nonalignment the privilege of independence of judgment. Moreover, they provide small countries with the foundation on which to build a structure of positive relationships with all countries, without becoming drawn into bloc rivalries.\n44.\tThose principles have even greater relevance today than when they were first articulated in a political sense, for today it is necessary for us to be nonaligned not only in relation to the great Powers but also in relation to disputes between and among other States, where efforts to reach accord can be exerted on a principled, impartial basis. Many disputes concern border issues, and it is a matter of great concern that existing United Nations mechanisms allow the international community to intervene in such disputes only when they have reached the point of armed confrontation. A process of moral or judicial intervention before confrontations erupt could help to eliminate the causes of friction or at least to buy time in which the political environment could change. It is in this context that Sri Lanka's proposal for the establishment of a border disputes commission is being studied within the nonaligned movement. We very much hope that that proposal will be given serious consideration by the international community.\n45.\tHowever, politics is not the only source of friction and insecurity in the world. Economic imbalance is an equally important factor. This was recognized by the non aligned countries as far back as their first Conference in 1961. The Declaration issued at the end of that Conference drew specific attention to the NorthSouth imbalance and made specific proposals for correcting that imbalance.3\n46.\tThe creation of a new social and economic order in the world has thus been as consistent a theme of the Movement as that of establishing a new political order. Today, when the impetus of anti-colonialism, spearheaded by the nonaligned movement, has ended colonialism except in a few stubborn pockets of vicious resistance, it is our responsibility to struggle even harder for political and economic justice.\n47.\tHaving in mind our current quest for social and economic goals, I should like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President. He tried hard to move North and South towards a mutually beneficial accommodation. The fact that those efforts did not produce the final results we all desired was not for want of trying on his part. The international community's gratitude and respect are due to him.\n48.\tOther speakers have commented on the assistance that has been received from the SecretaryGeneral. I add my felicitations to theirs. I wish to place on record, too, our appreciation of the responsibilities and workload of the staff of the Secretariat. They are the world's generally unsung and often unnoticed warriors of peace. They provide the continuity that gives our own efforts more than passing effect. We thank them.\n49.\tSri Lanka is pleased to welcome Vanuatu as a Member of the Organization. Each new Member strengthens and sustains the universality of the Organization, which is an objective laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. We are hopeful that before long all those peoples of the world who are as yet in a state of subjugation or displacement will eventually take their due place in the Organization, making it truly universal.\n50.\tPermit me for a few moments to refer to the domestic situation in Sri Lanka, a situation which should be of both interest and significance to the international community. This is a particularly important year for us,, because it marks the fiftieth anniversary of the exercise of universal adult franchise in Sri Lanka. Our democratic traditions were established long before modem parliamentary democracy was introduced in phases by a departing colonial administration. We are proud of our own traditions. We recognize, however, that the present structure of parliamentary government in Sri Lanka was set in place with the granting of universal adult franchise in Sri Lanka 50 years ago. During that half century we have fashioned political forms and practices which keep the fundamental tenets of democracy strong and meaningful in our country. We have also set in motion a process by which the aspirations of all communities in our country will be satisfied through constitutional means, without in any way sacrificing our national identity or integrity.\n51.\tIn the social and economic fields, no less than in the political and constitutional, we have pledged to give substance to the concept of human rights in all its dimensions. We do not believe that different sets of rights can be compartmentalized. On the contrary, it is our view that human rights in their fullest sense, as defined by the documents of the Organization, come alive only when man's rights within society are treated as a whole. That is our approach. It is an approach which requires commitment, skill and sophistication, qualities that can come only from within society. At the same time, we continue to hope for complementary support from the international community in the spirit of the Charter.\n52.\tThe interaction between domestic effort and external cooperation which I have described takes us to the heart of the NorthSouth relationship. I have pointed out that the proper definition and reshaping of this relationship was the focus of attention at the very first meeting of nonaligned countries and has continued since to attract the attention of all developing countries.\n53.\tThe Group of 77 has pursued with passion the goal of a NorthSouth compact. More recently we have been joined by several spokesmen of the North. Indeed, a great NorthSouth assessment of global challenges and global responses was provided for the international community by the report of the Brandt Commission, which was unveiled here. What do we have to show for those efforts?\n54.\tLast year the General Assembly convened its eleventh special session, which was devoted exclusively to an examination of international development issues. That session produced a program of targets for the strategy for development. We were pleased by the adoption of those targets; but development targets cannot be reached by declarations of intent.\n55.\tDevelopment is about people. The people's needs can be realized only by concrete measures which will sustain human will, measures which we had all hoped would emerge from the global round of negotiations which the eleventh special session of the General Assembly was meant to set in motion. A great deal of effort went into the search for agreement on basic preconditions. Many of the distinguished representatives here today, or their colleagues, participated in that exercise. Men and women of goodwill and prescience outside this Assembly joined in. Despite several setbacks, a remarkable area of agreement was identified. Nevertheless, disagreement cm mere procedures slowed down the momentum towards global negotiations. Can we be satisfied with leaving it at that? Are we content to allow history to judge us as lacking in the political will required to sort out one set of procedural options from' another? If so, we will be untrue to ourselves, and unfair to those millions we represent. For the fact is that those differences over procedure masked a much more important divergence, a divergence of commitment to a global compact.\n56.\tSuch a compact requires commitment not only at the broad level of global management of resources but also in terms of specific sectors such as trade, transfer of technology, energy and housing, for instance. Sri Lanka's Prime Minister, Mr. R. Premadasa, made a special plea in the Assembly at its preceding session on behalf of the homeless [14th meeting, para. 59]. He specifically proposed that the year 1981 be declared the international year of shelter for the homeless. This proposal was made in the knowledge that providing the homeless with adequate housing an essential component of an effective global assault on poverty, I repeat the Prime Minister's call, and express the hope that in this, as in other aspects of the assault on poverty, there will be no stalling. Time aggravates and does not heal.\n57.\tIt is only too easy to be discouraged by slow progress. Pessimism beckons readily. Nevertheless, there are also positive aspects in the situation and these deserve restatement. I will now turn to two areas of activity which give rise to hope, however slight they may seem.\n58.\tFirst, I would draw your attention to the recently concluded United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi. I was privileged to participate in preparations for the Conference and, of course, in the Conference itself. Because participation was at a high level it was possible for agreement to be reached on a number of principles which can govern the use and development of energy sources. This activity can mesh within the United Nations with the program of science and technology for development. We are pleased to note that some developed countries have already acted on the pledges made in Nairobi.\n59.\tSecondly, I would draw attention to the forthcoming NorthSouth meeting to be held at Cancun, where a small group of heads of State will meet informally to review NorthSouth issues. The rationale for such a meeting was that if these issues needed political action based on an exertion of political will, then it was logical for matters to be discussed by the only people with the power to take far-ranging political decisions. Despite initial delays, agreement has now been reached on holding a summit meeting. Nobody expects miraculous breakthroughs to result from the meeting at Cancun. But there is every possibility that views will be harmonized, and that the stage will be set for a genuine attempt to refashion the North South relationship. Agreement on the mountaintop can lead to real activity on the plains below.\n60.\tOptimism and euphoria are dangerous bedfellows. There are, as I have pointed out, a number of indications that should give rise to optimism. But this should not blind us to the need for sustained effort if we are to break through the barriers that hold us back from mutual progress. Nor should it lead us to ignore the very real threats to international peace and security that continue to imperil the world. The area broadly and popularly described as the Middle East continues to be a threat to international peace and security, burdened by tensions and uncertainties. An area which has given civilization so much of its wisdom and so many of its benign impulses is threatened by potentially explosive trends. We categorically assert, however, that a final settlement bringing lasting peace, justice and stability to the region will remain elusive until the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people are fully restored. Until that unalterable truth is accepted, peace moves will fail to produce results, or will produce . only piecemeal results. Sri Lanka has recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. To believe that issues affecting the integrity of the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights can be resolved without Palestinian participation in the process is very unrealistic.\n61.\tIn another area of the world, the rights of another group of people remain grievously unfulfilled. Despite assurances that various forms of persuasion are being directed at South Africa, the people of Namibia remain subjugated, and Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which held so much promise, remains unimplemented. The racist regime in South Africa is so contemptuous of persuasion, so aggressive in its outlook, that it unashamedly resorts to military onslaughts even against independent countries adjoining Namibia to shore up its own illegality. At the same time, it remains dedicated to barbaric policies of racial discrimination against the people within South Africa itself. South Africa's racist policies and its brutal militarism are both abhorrent and have been rightly condemned in the Assembly. The international community must now decide whether continued condemnation alone is sufficient to free the people of Namibia from illegal domination, and to liberate the people of South Africa from racism. If condemnation is inadequate, all measures required to bring South Africa to its senses must be diligently sought and applied. At the eighth emergency special session, on Namibia, recently concluded, the Assembly addressed itself to the various options before the international community.\n62.\tIn Asia, the region to which Sri Lanka belongs, several unhappy trends exist. The increasing military buildup by the great Powers in the Indian Ocean is a source of grave concern to all littoral and hinterland States. Throughout history the region has been the hunting ground of contending Powers. We do not want to be embroiled in such Power rivalry or to be the scene of such rivalry. Sri Lanka urges, therefore, that all States, including the permanent members of the Security Council, should cooperate with the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to convene the Conference on the Indian Ocean at Colombo not later than the first half of 1983. That Conference is, in our view, the next logical major step towards the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.\n63.\tWe are equally concerned about the entrenchment of interventionist forces in two Asian States, Afghanistan and Kampuchea, both members of the group of non aligned countries. The situation in both countries has been exhaustively examined here and we have made our views very clear. We believe that the people of every State must enjoy the right to determine their own destiny free from any foreign interference. We believe that the continued presence of interventionist forces in the territory of sovereign States is contrary to the accepted norms of international conduct. We fear too that their continued presence increases domestic instability and sharpens regional tensions. Therefore, we hope that all interventionist forces will be withdrawn from both countries.\n64.\tThe arms race dominates all other issues. The tenth special session of the General Assembly, convened on the initiative of the nonaligned countries, gave some impetus to moves towards disarmament, but that movement has been so slow as to be all but unrecognizable. Despite the repeatedly stated desire of the international community for genuine progress towards disarmament, much of the world seems to be progressing in the opposite direction. Can we not reverse that trend? We will be presented with the opportunity to do so at next year's special session devoted to disarmament. In this connection, we are hopeful that the proposal made at the tenth special session by President J. R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka for the establishment of a world disarmament authority [4th meeting, paras. 1719] will be considered favorably. The proposed authority could serve as a much needed catalyst for slowing down the arms race.\n65.\tWe would also like to see all matters pertaining to the law of the sea resolved next year. As an island State, we are particularly concerned about orderly, equitable and legitimate access to the sea's resources. The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has passed through the complicated phase of detailed Negotiation. Only a formal adoption of negotiated agreements is required. We hope that all countries will join in working towards this end at the session of the Conference to be held in March 1982.\n66.\tThe agenda before us is heavy. It contains a fair mix of political and economic issues. This is inevitable, because politics and economics are so closely related. When political issues are unresolved, they create social and economic repercussions. Where economic disparities persist, political upheaval follows. The real guarantee of international security, therefore, lies in a balance of political and economic justice, domestically, regionally and internationally. Let us pledge ourselves to securing that balance.\n"

        "file_text": "The election at the beginning of our proceedings of Mr. Kittani of Iraq to the high post of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is a tribute to his exceptional qualities as a diplomat and a statesman. A more authoritative voice than my own that of the head of the Congolese delegation, Comrade Pierre Nze, Member of the Political Bureau and Minister for Foreign Affairs could more eloquently have welcomed this signal honor not only to Mr. Kittani personally but also to Iraq, a country friendly to the People's Republic of the Congo. I am happy to extend to him the most cordial congratulations of my delegation and to take this occasion to let him know how particularly pleased we are that our work is being guided by a man already known for his competence and great probity.\n258.\tI should like to associate myself with the many speakers who have extended to his predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, well-deserved praise for the brilliant and effective manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the thirty-fifth session.\n259.\tFinally, above and beyond the ritual aspects of the occasion, I wish to extend a warm welcome to Vanuatu and Belize, which have just been admitted as full Members of the United Nations. \u201eThe presence among us of those two States which have only just emerged from colonial darkness bears witness to the substantial decolonization efforts accomplished by the United Nations, which, for 20 years now, has been the focal point of decisive actions that have led to the collapse of citadels of colonialism which only yesterday had been firmly entrenched.\n260.\tThe victory of the peoples of Vanuatu and Belize comes at just the right time to confirm the justice of the national liberation struggle being waged by freedom fighters against colonial oppression and exploitation. The whole humble history of mankind should remind us that when a people is determined to break the humiliating shackles of submission, no force can resist the inexorable whirlwind stirred up by its inflexible determination. The delegation of the Congo wishes to assure the representatives of those two new Member States of its cooperation and solidarity.\n261.\tThe constant quest on the part of my country for increased solidarity and ever greater understanding among nations is justified by our people's conviction that only a dynamic mobilization of all peace-loving peoples can stop the advance of aggressive forces which are now giving rise to growing alarm the world over.\n262.\tYesterday the weakness of peaceful peoples fostered the outbreak of Nazism and fascism, which were responsible for millions of deaths. Who knows into what catastrophes of history we shall be led tomorrow by the imperialist policy of confrontation which has imbued international relations with the characteristics of the East West tensions, fraught with so many dangers? The arms race is proceeding at a rapid pace. The world looks on powerlessly at a kind of call to arms on the part of the blocs. Instead of the policy of detente, which the non aligned countries have always cherished, we see developing today dangerous dialectics of confrontation. Those who are inclined to welcome unashamedly the intensification of international tension are wrong. Today the problem of how to maintain peace has become, because of the nuclear aspect, a global problem, a problem for all States, large and small.\n263.\tIn this explosive international situation there come into being everywhere hotbeds of tension which are being maintained feverishly, with the object of extending spheres of influence, by increasing the number of military bases in defenseless countries and establishing thinly disguised protectorates.\n264.\tThe case of Africa is one of the most troubling; the threats to that continent take many forms, first of all, there is the persistence of an ecological crisis caused by the encroachment of the desert and the constant drought which gravely affects a number of countries situated between Cape Verde and the Horn of Africa.\n265.\tThe economic threat, for its part, can be seen in the powerful domination exercised by multinational interests, for which Africa is nothing but a reservoir of raw materials and, furthermore, in the extreme weakness of a form of economy which depends strongly on foreign markets.\n266.\tThe political crisis is compounded by a military threat that affects Africa on all sides, one of the most obvious aspects of which is the wanton continuance of the occupation of Namibia by South Africa. Hie increasingly aggressive policy of that racist regime is a matter of grave concern for the whole continent. The continuance of the hateful policy of apartheid and the over-armament of the Pretoria regime, which, in addition to using many other methods of intimidation, is considering resorting to the blackmail of nuclear weapons to defend its anachronistic and anti-human philosophy, constitute flagrant examples of injustice in the world today.\n267.\tFinally, of all continents, Africa has the greatest number of refugees and the largest number of so-called least developed countries. Praiseworthy efforts have at times been projected, especially as regards the humanitarian aspects or, more generally, the economic and social aspects, to which we shall return later in our statement. As for the necessary prerequisites for the creation of confidence and the most favorable conditions for the establishment of peace in that part of the world, as yet we see no signs that might give cause for optimism.\n268.\tAs long as South Africa, which is racist and colonialist, does not regard itself as an African State with the same concepts of freedom and respect for human dignity as the other African peoples, there can be no doubt that international peace and security will constantly be breached in that area. Against whom, and why, is racist South Africa acquiring nuclear weapons? The unconditional protectors of the champions of apartheid could no doubt provide the international community with a clear response to that agonizing question.\n269.\tTo proceed methodically, we should at least begin by returning Namibia to its people. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) was drafted with that in mind. In the view of my delegation, that is the only pragmatic approach that might pave the way to a just and peaceful solution of the problem of Namibia, which, as every one of us knows, remains essentially a problem of decolonization. We should remember that it is South Africa which unilaterally took the initiative of breaking off the negotiations that were begun by the contact group of five Western countries. That was indeed a serious step, in, the face of which the silence of the international community seems strangely \\\"deafening\\\". My country, of course, encourages any initiative which might bring closer the exercise by the people of Namibia, under the aegis of SWAPO, its only authentic representative, of its right to freedom and independence.\n270.\tThe culmination of the process of decolonization in Namibia would have the initial effect of restoring peace in the southern part of the continent and of enabling the so called front-line African States to concentrate on the essential task of the economic and social development of their countries. However, South Africa, which claims to be a besieged fortress, is opposing the advent of a climate of peace and cooperation in the region, increasing in a disgraceful and criminal manner its aggressive acts against those States which endeavor to implement courageously the relevant resolutions of the Organization with regard to the assistance that all Member States are duty-bound to provide to the Namibian people, whose territory has been transformed by the South African soldiery into a sweatshop, where men, women and children of the heroic Namibian people are suffering helplessly. The latest of these aggressive acts has been directed at the People's Republic of Angola and is continued today through the occupation by Pretoria's army of a part of the territory of a Member State of the United Nations.\n271.\tIn this case scandal and criminality reach the highest point when the international community does not even consider doing anything to dissuade the aggressor.\n272.\tIt might even be concluded from this, as was stated quite rightly by our Minister for Foreign Affairs at the eighth emergency special session [5th meeting], that it seems that Angola is being accused simply because it is implementing the relevant decisions of the Organization by what is its special contribution to the cause of the liberation of colonial countries and peoples.\n273.\tThe Organization has the political and moral duty to act before it is too late to defuse the tension persisting in that part of Africa. The Congolese Government, for its part, supports unreservedly the struggle of the fraternal people of Angola to defend its independence and its territorial integrity. Today, imperialism and its accomplices are crisscrossing Angola with their plots. Their efforts are to no avail because the Angolan people, faithful to the heritage of Aghostino Neto, will take up the challenge and will victoriously defend the gains of its revolution.\n274.\tMy delegation is very pleased to welcome the progress which, after so much suffering and anguish, has just crowned the efforts of the OAU to end the tragedy experienced by the fraternal people of Chad. The Congolese Government supports the praiseworthy efforts of this fraternal country towards reconciliation and national reconstruction. Some of the Western press, accustomed to giving its readers spicy stories about the third world, has recently indulged, in referring to the detachment of Congolese soldiers which, at the urgent request of the QAU, my Government agreed to send to N'Djamena, in hate filled and defamatory articles which show the disdain with which these unworthy journalists regard the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, which they consider to be inferior. The Congolese People's National Army is the army of our militant people, and was formed in accordance with the strict precepts of the Congolese Workers' Party. Its mission in Chad was supervised by an outstanding member of our Party and by the Chad Transitional National Union Government during the three months when our troops were constantly confined to the barracks of the N'Djamena police force. In any case, my Government challenges this blinkered press to show the least proof of its fabrications. This slanderous campaign on the part of Western media, directed now at one regime, and now at some other country in the third world, will in no way change the firm, commitment of African States in general and those of Central Africa in particular which stand shoulder to shoulder with our Chadian brothers so that that people can recover, with its independence, people and the pride of place which it occupies in our subregion.\n275.\tIn the northern part of the African continent, the problem of the decolonization of the Western Sahara has created a situation with an extreme degree of antagonism between the various protagonists in the Maghreb. It is gratifying that a referendum on self-determination has been decided upon, to enable the Sahraoui people, after a free and clear choice, to become independent. Whatever happens, Congo joins with the QAU and the United Nations in supporting the common efforts of the two organizations directed towards a just and final settlement of that problem.\n276.\tThe Indian Ocean, although it has been declared by the United Nations to be a \\\"zone of peace\\\", is today the scene of intense military activity. We are witnessing in this area a strengthening of naval fleets and military troops on the part of the great Powers. My Government again supports the efforts of the Organization, which should lead to the holding of conferences so that the Indian Ocean might indeed become a genuine zone of peace. We are convinced that the problem of the Comorian island of Mayotte and that of the Glorieuses islands will soon be subject to positive and sincere negotiations between the French Government on the one hand and the Governments of Comoros and Madagascar respectively.\n277.\tWe cherish the idea of peace in the Middle East, where there still rages increasing violence because of the obdurate refusal of Israel to negotiate with the PLO. The position constantly maintained by my delegation is that the Palestinian issue is at the heart of the entire Middle East tragedy. Hence, any initiative of the \\\"Camp David agreement\\\" type becomes ineffective if it disregards the fundamental inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n278.\tThe activities of the Israeli Government, with its serious and repeated acts in violation of international peace and security, are making bad worse, instead of helping to create a climate favorable to constructive negotiations in the quest for conditions for a lasting and final peace in that important part of the world. The bombing of Tamuz in Iraq, the bombing of civilian populations in Beirut in Lebanon, bear the marks of the determination of a Government wrongly bent on practicing a no-holds barred policy.\n279.\tThe case of Kampuchea is typical of the present crisis in international relations. In the face of all the facts, some Member States still want the world to believe that the people of Kampuchea never wished to rid itself, at all costs, of the Pol Pot dictatorship. It is obvious to my delegation that the inappropriate representation of Kampuchea at the United Nations serves as nothing more than a pretext to facilitate an intolerable interference in the internal affairs of that country and to delay as much as possible the dawning of an era of fraternal peace and cooperation in SouthEast Asia.\n280.\tThe orchestrated campaign round the so-called rebel bands which are being armed in full view of the whole world to fight the legal Government of Kampuchea are contrary to all the rules of international law. The Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea is not only exercising effective authority over the whole national territory, but has since the beginning of the new Republic begun to rebuild the country on the ashes of the genocide perpetrated by Pol Pot. My country hopes that the peoples of SouthEast Asia who, throughout their long and glorious history, have given so many examples of wisdom and political courage to the world, will regain control of themselves and work henceforth in the quest for peaceful solutions to the disputes which are momentarily setting them one against the other.\n281.\tAs regards Korea, here also we fail to see the grounds for a policy of maintaining the division of this great people into two parts, North Korea and South Korea. Congo has always maintained that the United Nations should work towards the creation of conditions leading to a dialog, free from any foreign pressures, between the two parts of Korea. We note that recently there has been a renewal of terror in South Korea against patriots who are in favor of the independence and peaceful reunification of that great country. There must be an end to any foreign interference in the affairs of Korea so that its people may embark upon the path of fraternal and constructive dialog.\n282.\tTwenty years ago the First Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries met at Belgrade and proclaimed that active international cooperation in the fields of material and cultural exchanges among peoples is an essential means for the strengthening of confidence in the possibility of peaceful coexistence.\n283.\tSince it did not meet that requirement in time, the world must now deal with a far-reaching economic crisis and grapple with ways and means to facilitate the establishment of a new international economic order. The elements of that new order have already been laid down for the developing countries, in particular in the Group of 77.\n284.\tThe developing countries, which have been fully exposed to the harmful consequences of a particularly unjust order, have for some years been calling for the democratization of international economic relations. Yet those demands are far from being unattainable. Perhaps we could recall a few aspects of the approach of the developing countries, which might be summed up in the following manner.\n285.\tFirst, the required improvement in international trade relations must include the necessary stability in the terms of trade, particularly those for primary commodities and a preferential access by the developing countries to the markets of the industrialized countries.\n286.\tSecondly, we must regulate the flow of foreign private capital and increase the favorable consequences of that flow. Here we come to the question of restricting the activities of transnational corporations and the transfer of technology.\n287.\tMoreover, it is absolutely necessary that the vicious circle of aid and indebtedness be broken in at least two concomitant ways. In the first place, the developing countries must be provided with an inflow of official capital and, above all, the developed countries must meet their commitment to devote at least 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance. Some developed countries have already understood that, as shown by the recent position taken in that respect by the new French Government. We commend that Government and urge other developed countries to exert some effort in that direction. In the second place, there must be a moratorium on the debts of the developing countries, which are being literally crushed by the servicing of those debts. Lastly, there must be a democratization of the international monetary system and the decision-making apparatus of certain international institutions.\n288.\tAs can be noted, those measures contain nothing more than a proposal that the wealthy countries should further concern themselves more with the problems of hunger and poverty throughout the world instead, for example, of throwing themselves headlong into the unbridled arms race, which is now swallowing up almost $550 billion a year, and which is continually perfecting armaments for the apocalypse weapons of mass destruction which would destroy all of mankind, such as the neutron bomb, which has been condemned by the overwhelming majority of international public opinion. If only $20 billion annually were devoted to development, who could deny the impact that such a commitment might have on the economy of the countries of the periphery?\n289.\tAfter a long period of confrontation and sterile invectives, the NorthSouth dialog seems today to be giving rise to some cautious optimism. This year, the schedule of meetings shows the awareness of the countries in both groups of the interdependency which closely governs the international economy and of the need to come forward, within a reasonable period of time, with a solution in the interests of the parties involved. In May 1981, at the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held at Caracas, Venezuela, the developing countries drew up proposals for what has been called \\\"SouthSouth economic cooperation\\\". In July of the same year, it was the turn of Ottawa to host a conference of the major industrialized countries, which worked together on the serious problems of development. Recently, at the beginning of September, in Paris, France was host to a United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. In October in Cancun, thanks to the joint initiative of Austria and Mexico, a limited summit meeting will take place, bringing together about 20 heads of State and Government from the center and periphery countries. Lastly, between now and the end of the year, a United Nations conference on development is to be held at United Nations Headquarters in New York.\n290.\tAll that activity is designed to attempt to get the NorthSouth global negotiations under way. No doubt that is a complex area, in which each camp must rise above its self-interests, and where there are at present no grounds for optimism. But what leader, what statesman could remain deaf to that siren call of history to take part in an endeavor to build a more just, fraternal new world?\n291.\tThe time has come for my delegation to congratulate most sincerely the SecretaryGeneral, whose dedication to the cause of peace and the wellbeing of nations, both large and small, is praiseworthy.\n292.\tThe best way to exorcise old ghosts is to draw up as complete a list of them as possible so as to know what to expect. That is what we have attempted to do in the course of this statement.\n293.\tAt a time when great storms are rising on the horizon, we must, all of us together, once and for all, reexamine the causes of the dangers which threaten international peace. The Organization has urgent duties to discharge, crucial problems to solve and dangers to avoid. Let us help it in' good faith through our devotion to the cause of peace\u2014a peace which must become the decisive focal point of international life.\n"

        "file_text": "This is the time of the year when New York is characterized by a festive atmosphere, caused by the numerous receptions, dinners and other gatherings which mark the commencement of the work of a new session of the General Assembly thirty third session, thirty-fourth, thirty-fifth, thirty-sixth and so on. The higher figure each year indicates that we are getting further and further away from the calamities and tribulations of the Second World War. Unfortunately, it also indicates and reminds us that we are getting further away from the possibility of arresting and containing an undesirable vicious circle of events, which may take us back to where we started: the world war.\n369.\tSometimes one wonders what the reason is for the revelry and the festivities in New York each September. Do we celebrate in order to divert our attention from the fact that we have failed to make the Organization effective and consequently worthwhile? Do we celebrate because we no longer care about the fate of this mammoth entity which has been reduced to a cul-de-sac in which problems enter but never emerge because they are never resolved and settled?\n370.\tIn extending my warmest congratulations to Mr. Kittani and in expressing my deep satisfaction at his election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, I should like to refer to the wise and correct assessment in his opening statement:\n\\\"The General Assembly is not in need of new resolutions but rather a commitment to the resolutions it has already adopted and to the implementation of those resolutions by translating them into concrete actuality, thereby contributing to the principles and purposes of the United Nations\\\". [1st meeting, para. 60.]\nThis session should rightly, therefore, be devoted to work, to implementation and follow-up rather than to repetitious and lengthy statements and resolutions.\n371.\tThe remark I have cited, the substance of which is reflected in many reports of the Secretary-General as well, constitutes the quintessence of the very existence of the^United Nations. Member States, and especially those which are small, weak and undefended, should have the opportunity to inscribe on the agenda not only their problems but also their hopes, their visions and their ambitions. As things are at the moment, they only inscribe their frustration and their skepticism about the future of the world.\n372.\tOn this score, a proposal made by the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Spyros Kyprianou, for the holding of a special session of the General Assembly on the vital issue of the implementation of United Nations resolutions may be recalled and repeated.\n373.\tAs I stand at the rostrum of the General Assembly, I ask myself: are we really united in the causes we are supposed to cherish, promote and protect? Are we really united as far as social and economic justice, human rights, political independence and the principles of international behavior are concerned? Are we united in our efforts to buttress plans for the upgrading and moral evolution of man? Or are we simply united in witnessing the predicament and misery of the human being, unable to halt the nosedive which man has taken in his national and international affairs and activities?\n374.\tWe are nearing the end of this year, with many of the world problems no nearer to a solution. New and ominous events have taken place and relations between East and West are ever strained, thus creating a bleak world outlook. The problems of the Middle East, Namibia, that of my own country and many others remain unresolved, despite the efforts of the international community through the Organization, and new acts of aggression and violations of the Charter of the United Nations have occurred in the past year. We are further confronted by the inability to make progress on the global disarmament and economic issues, while poverty and famine continue to ravage a large part of the world population.\n375.\tBeset by an atmosphere of poisoned EastWest relations, the international community becomes all the more obligated to find ways for tangible progress towards solving the global issues and such regional conflicts, the persistence of which directly affects the maintenance of international peace and security.\n376.\tThe point is pertinently reflected in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization, where it is stated:\n\\\"The setbacks to EastWest relations and a number of unresolved regional conflicts are a dangerous combination. The main thrust of the efforts of the United Nations has therefore been devoted to attempts to resolve or to contain such conflicts.\\\" [A/36/1, sect. IV.]\n377.\tIn maintaining world peace and security, peacekeeping operations play a significant, indeed vital, role. Essential to peacekeeping is peacemaking. Otherwise, peacekeeping would become an end in itself and would perpetuate an unjust status quo. It would soothe the pain without curing the trauma. Necessary for effective peacekeeping and peacemaking efforts is the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions, if a situation is to be brought to a just and lasting settlement. In connection with the aforementioned, I wish to express once again the appreciation and gratitude of my Government to UNFICYP, as well as to the countries contributing to the peacekeeping operation, and repeat once again that we sincerely hope that these valuable and praiseworthy services will be necessary for the shortest possible period of time.\n378.\tPosing a major threat to international peace and stability is the escalation of the arms race. The increased tension in EastWest relations and the doctrines of balance of power and deterrence have triggered an unprecedented competition, the world over, for the acquisition of armaments. Our goal for achieving disarmament, and in particular nuclear disarmament, as set out in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, contained in resolution S10/2, appears to be very far from realization. We cannot afford any more setbacks, and strenuous efforts should continue to ensure the cessation of the arms race, nuclear disarmament, a comprehensive nuclear-test ban treaty and strict adherence to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [General Assembly resolution 2373 (XXII), annex].\n379.\tToday, more than $100 per annum for each and every living person are spent worldwide on armaments. That amount is equal to 50 percent of the per capita income in many countries of the world. It is indeed paradoxical to have to spend 50 per cent of the amount needed to preserve life for life's destruction and extermination.\n380.\tThis year the United Nations and every non aligned country are observing the twentieth anniversary of the First Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held at Belgrade. We retain with gratitude fond memories of the founding fathers of the movement and their broad and all-embracing vision that has literally transformed the world scene and given a new dimension to international relations. Great names such as Tito, Nehru, Nasser, our own Makarios and so many others are identified with the noble ideals and principles of nonalignment, ideals and principles that account for the unprecedented growth of the movement, which now encompasses the. great majority of the membership of the United Nations and plays a positive and constructive role in the quest for solutions to many of the problems of the world.\n381.\tOne of the major initiatives of the nonaligned movement has been in connection with the efforts for the transformation of the present unbalanced and unjust world economic system through the establishment of a new international economic order. In the absence of such an order, many millions will remain in abject poverty and the gap between the North and the South, between the \\\"haves\\\" and \\\"have-nots\\\", will become wider. The continuation of such an unacceptable situation constitutes yet another threat to world peace, stability and security. Despite the urgency involved, the launching of the global round of negotiations and the implementation of the new International Development Strategy have, regrettably, not materialized. None the, less, we wish to commend the constructive and persistent efforts of your predecessor, Mr. President, and express our earnest hope that, given the necessary political will on the part of all countries concerned and especially the developed ones, the task will be completed under your guidance. In this respect, we trust that the Cancun meeting will take decisive steps towards the launching of those negotiations.\n382.\tClosely linked with the new international economic order is the establishment of the new world information and communication order, which in fact constitutes an integral part of the development strategy. The increasing awareness of the influence which news media can exert on the life and progress of peoples, coupled with existing and growing disparities among nations in this area, has led to demands, mainly by the nonaligned countries, for the establishment of the new information order which would provide and safeguard a free and balanced flow of information based, among other things, on diversity of sources and free access to information.\n383.\tThe Program of Action adopted by consensus at Nairobi at the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, 18 though not living up to the developing countries' expectations, is an important first step that, given the necessary follow-up and faithful implementation, could lead to the beginning of the solution of one of the most acute problems facing the world today. Further broadening of cooperation and more effective utilization of existing sources, as well as the transfer of technology, are necessary prerequisites for the completion of the task, provided that adequate financing is also secured.\n384.\tThe recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries has identified the need for concerted efforts and international cooperation in order to provide the urgently needed assistance to those countries, which would help alleviate their plight. Here, again, a lot more needs to be done.\n385.\tThe resumed tenth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva this year under the leadership of Mr. Koh, has somewhat mitigated the disappointment at not having a convention on the law of the sea in 1981 and, it is hoped, brings us closer to a convention in 1982. The Conference was thus able to achieve positive results on the outstanding issue of maritime boundary delimitation. It is earnestly hoped that the remaining issues will be satisfactorily resolved at the next session of the Conference.\n386.\tThe intensive and arduous efforts of the past 15 years should not be frustrated by the reopening of substantive and difficult issues which have already been negotiated and agreed to by all delegations to the Conference. Otherwise, we would be depriving mankind of one of its vital common heritages and jeopardizing efforts for a regulated and just regime for the seas.\n387.\tThe lack of any progress of substance at the Madrid follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is causing considerable apprehension. The Conference will reconvene next month, and Cyprus, together with all other participating countries and particularly the neutral and nonaligned will exert every effort to achieve a breakthrough and thus safeguard and promote an important process for detente, cooperation and confidence-building in Europe and, by extension, throughout the world.\n388.\tAmong the most serious international problems, the perpetuation of which greatly threatens international peace and security, are the problems of the Middle East and Palestine. The position of my Government on these problems has been stated time and again before the Assembly as well as other international forums and can be summarized as follows:\n389.\tIt is our firm belief that the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the Middle East problem, and there can be no comprehensive, viable and just solution without taking into account the legitimate aspirations and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, national independence and sovereignty, the right of all refugees and displaced Palestinians to return to their ancestral homes and properties and their right to establish their own independent sovereign State in Palestine.\n390.\tWe recognize the PLO as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, whose active participation, on an equal footing, is indispensable in all efforts, deliberations and conferences on the Middle East. Partial agreements, in their absence, in so far as they purport to solve this problem, are not valid.\n391.\tCyprus strongly adheres to the fundamental principle that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible and can never be legitimized, whether in Palestine or elsewhere. We therefore believe that the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Palestinian and Arab territories is imperative and long overdue.\n392.\tWe deplore the continuing creation of faits accomplis such as the annexation of Jerusalem, and the sustained policies of colonization through new settlements aiming at altering the legal status of the occupied territories and changing their demographic characteristics. We firmly believe that belligerency must come to an end and that the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area must be recognized and respected, as should be the right of all States to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.\n393.\tCyprus deplores the grave developments that have recently taken place in Lebanon as a consequence of the Israeli acts of aggression against civilian targets in Beirut and southern Lebanon, which constitute a blatant violation of all norms of international law. Once again, we reaffirm our total commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence of Lebanon.\n394.\tThe Israeli air raid on the Iraqi nuclear installations constitutes yet another totally unjustified and unwarranted act of aggression directed against the sovereignty and independence of Iraq The Government and people of Cyprus joined the international community in strongly condemning that gross and flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter, which has created additional dangers to peace in that sensitive area of the world.\n395.\tThe hostilities between Iran and Iraq, two neighboring nonaligned countries, continue to cause anxiety, particularly to the members of the nonaligned movement. Cyprus, together with the rest of the world, expresses the earnest hope that sustained efforts, and particularly those of the Foreign Ministers of Cuba, India, Zamoia and the Head of the Political Department of the PLO, will soon bear fruits and the whole issue will be peacefully resolved. These were the considerations that prompted my Government to offer Cyprus as a venue for preparatory work connected with the aforesaid initiative of the non aligned countries. I wish to reiterate that we shall continue to offer every facility, and shall spare no effort to assist in the quest for achieving a settlement.\n396.\tAnother issue which is causing grave concern is the situation in SouthEast Asia, which should be solved in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in such a way as to preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries concerned. It is in this respect that we are encouraged by the progress, however limited to date, of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. We express the hope that his efforts will be crowned by complete success as soon as possible and that, similarly, the Kampuchean problem will also be resolved.\n397.\tThe situation in Namibia continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. The present impasse created by the constant provocation and arrogance with which South Africa flouts the decisions of the international community, coupled with the failure of the Security Council to impose mandatory sanctions against South Africa, leads to the escalation of an already explosive situation in the region.\n398.\tI do not propose to reiterate the well-known position of my Government on the question of Namibia, as I did so only a few days ago at the sixth meeting of the. eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly. Suffice it for me to quote from the statement of the current chairman of the group of African States, Mr. Bedjaoui of Algeria, who said that that session was \\\"a very special phase in the mobilization of the international community for the just cause of the Namibian people\\\" and that the resolution adopted at that session served \\\"to maintain the ever growing momentum of our solidarity with the Namibian people's legitimate struggle for national liberation\\\".\n399.\tMy country, a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, was among the original sponsors of the resolution finally adopted [resolution ES8/2] and will continue to associate itself fully with all United Nations efforts for the genuine independence of a united Namibia. We shall continue to oppose all efforts aimed at an internal settlement in Namibia and support the implementation of the United Nations plan, in accordance with Security \u2022Council resolution 435 (1978), without any prevarication, qualification or modification. We shall similarly implement the provisions of the resolutions adopted at the ninth special session.\n400.\tWe strongly and vehemently condemn the large scale incursions of South Africa into neighboring front-line States, as manifested by the latest invasion of Angola, and wish to repeat our total support for SWAPO, the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people in their hard struggle for self-determination and independence.\n401.\tOur commitment is equally strong concerning the final eradication of the abhorrent doctrine of apartheid practiced by the Pretoria regime. Cyprus strongly condemns the continuing terror and brutal repression in South Africa, a recent manifestation of which was the death sentences imposed on the three freedom fighters. These sentences emphasize once again the urgency of the problem and the necessity for speedy implementation of the United Nations resolutions on South Africa.\n402.\tConcerning the question of Western Sahara, we welcome the constructive and dedicated efforts of the OAU to ensure a peaceful solution of this problem through the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of that Territory. The United Nations should play an active role in the implementation of the relevant decision of the OAU in order to ensure that the referendum is organized and conducted in the most proper, fair and impartial way.\n403.\tIn the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the United Nations can look back with pride to what has already been achieved, especially in the domain \u2022 of the promulgation of binding international standards. Much more effort is still needed in the sphere of implementation, especially in cases of mass, flagrant and continuous violations of human rights coming in the wake of aggression from without or upheaval and oppression from within. That is why my delegation holds the firm view that what we need is not idealistic declarations alone; more important, and indeed more urgent, is the need to concentrate on ways and means for their effective and full implementation.\n404.\tDetermined and coordinated efforts are still needed, but let us not forget that human rights coincided with creation, that they fulfill the aspirations of individuals and that the tide of the quest for their implementation now sweeping the world cannot be stemmed by the prevarications or negative attitudes of individual Governments.\n405.\tIn rededicating ourselves to the defense of human rights let us all resolve to cooperate fully with international mechanisms of implementation that we have ourselves set up. In this connection, my delegation would like to commend and express its satisfaction at the work done by such human rights organs as the Commission on Human Rights, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Human Rights Committee.\n406.\tWe warmly welcome the admission of the Republic of Vanuatu and the accession to independence of Belize. Thus have additional steps been taken towards the achievement of universality by the United Nations and the elimination of colonialism.\n407.\tThe question of my country, Cyprus, is part of the long list of subjects on the agenda of the thirty-sixth session. The just and correct remedial actions contained in past resolutions of the Organization providing for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, unity, non alignment and demilitarization of Cyprus, as well as for the withdrawal of foreign troops, the voluntary return of the refugees to their homes in safety and tracing and accounting for the fate of the missing persons, have unfortunately remained a dead letter, a dismal reminder of the fact that this international giant has the muscles of an infant on its executive arms. The foreign occupation and not just \\\"the coup and subsequent events\\\" is still the cause of the political malaise which permeates the country.\n408.\tThe problem of Cyprus was not discussed in this forum last year. The Government of Cyprus, after extensive consultations with the Governments of the nonaligned countries and many other Governments, decided that this was the right course of action in the circumstances prevailing at that time. This year the question of Cyprus is inscribed on the agenda, while efforts, through negotiations, still continue. This time, however, there is an additional factor: the 12 month-long frustrating experience of the negotiations, during which the grip of the occupying forces has not loosened. Moreover, the situation was . not improved in any substantive way by the Hirkish Cypriot proposals of 5 August, which were minimal and inadequate.\n409.\tThe Hirkish Cypriot leader has alleged that he has offered us the stars in his proposals. If he thinks that the stars are equal to 2.7 per cent of an occupied land, then certainly Mr. Denktag's notion of the universe must be erroneous.\n410.\tIn view of those factors, we shall insist on a full scale discussion of the question of Cyprus, either during this session or at a resumed or other session later on, if developments necessitate such a course of action.\n411.\tSince September last year the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in Cyprus, Mr. Gobbi, have been at pains to ensure the achievement of some progress. Mr. Waldheim worked with dedication, and his work is commendable. The results, however, have been trivial compared to the efforts exerted. Despite this situation and despite the very poor progress hitherto, the Greek Cypriot side has expressed the will to continue the dialog, and in this context it has presented further proposals which will facilitate the negotiating process.\n412.\tIn his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General, in referring to Cyprus, says:\n\\\"To take advantage of this situation, I and my Special Representative may find it necessary to make special efforts and present some new ideas, as appropriate, to sustain the momentum of the negotiating process. I hope that any such moves on my part will be accepted in the spirit in which they are offered, as tools of the negotiating process for the purpose of facilitating progress towards an agreed solution. It bears repeating that continued delay in this effort only serves to consolidate the status quo, which both parties have found to be unsatisfactory.\\\" [A/36/1, sect. IV.]\n413.\tWe are at the moment meticulously considering the possible initiative just mentioned. We trust that any proposed action of the Secretary-General will be based on his good.Offices mandate, and they must be within the framework of the United Nations resolutions relevant to the question of Cyprus and the high-level agreements between President Makarios and Mr. Denkta and President Kyprianou and Mr. Denkta which were concluded in the Secretary-General's presence and under his auspices.IV We are viewing this new development with the seriousness it deserves and we shall not hesitate to express to the Secretary-General our well-considered opinion as soon as possible in the course of the next few weeks.\n414.\tCyprus is one of the small countries of the world, but its wish and will to contribute towards the solution of problems is enormous. We may be physically maimed but we are mentally and morally unbent and unflappable. We believe that, with hard work, perseverance, goodwill, fairness of mind and devotion to principles, not only small countries like ours but the whole world may find the way to more promising and prosperous days.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, your recognized diplomatic skill and your familiarity with the workings of the Organization augur well for the success of this session of the General Assembly. I sincerely congratulate you on your election,\n168.\tOn behalf of the Government of Mexico 1 convey the most cordial welcome to the new independent State of Vanuatu, which is joining our ranks and thus enriching the Organization.\n169.\tI should also like to make specific reference to the other recently emergent sovereign State whose independence was proclaimed yesterday\u2014I am obviously speaking of Belize, a sister nation so close to Mexico not only by virtue of geography but, most importantly, in its aspiration to build its own future. My Government was the first to support its admission to the United Nations.\n170.\tMexico views the independence of Belize as an example of how, through the organizations set up by the international community for the purpose of living together in peace and harmony, it is possible to ensure prevalence of the loftiest principles, particularly that which governs my Government's foreign policy: the self-determination of peoples. In the process which ended yesterday, the resolution adopted by the Assembly last year [resolution 35120] was decisive. In that resolution the Assembly unreservedly supported the right of the people of Belize to independence. As for Mexico, it is our firm intention to cooperate politically and economically with the new State so that it should fully consolidate its independence. Nonetheless, we are concerned at the additional element of tension introduced into the area and around our frontiers by virtue of the Government of Guatemala's failure to recognize the independence of Belize. We hope that the two neighbor nations of Mexico, Belize and Guatemala will shortly find a mutually acceptable solution by the only effective means: negotiation* we offer our cooperation to that end.\n171.\tIt is almost trite today to say that the international situation is getting considerably worse. All the Member States and peoples know this because they daily suffer the consequences of that worsening situation. What is important today as far as Mexico is concerned, what is essential, is carefully to consider the reasons why the tensions afflicting the world are becoming more acute, so that the international community as a whole can take action to halt the trend.\n172.\tIn our opinion, there are two major factors which have caused that deterioration in the international climate: first, the; growing political confrontation between the two superPowers, taking the form of a real war of words which has shattered detente; and secondly, the increasing number of obstacles facing developing countries in their struggle to change both the internal structures of their countries and to transform international economic relations.\n173.\tToday, we cannot talk about a mere stalemate in the detente process which was begun about 20 years ago and on which so many hopes were placed throughout the world. It is in open rout. We are going back to the era of strident rhetoric, of the arms race, a race which is absurd, because there can be no winner. Again, we are faced with a lack of dialog or even of communication, and above all, we are seeing a situation in which the selfish interests of the major Powers are placed before the higher interests of the international community A few years ago, during the era of detente, it was possible to talk of imposing on the rest of the world the joint force of SovietNorth American understanding; today, with greater reason, we can say that a worse joint force is being imposed on mankind that of confrontation.\n174.\tIt is not up to any individual country to hand out prizes or lay blame or point the accusing finger at those allegedly responsible. But it is the obligation of every country clearly to state its position when faced with the growing number of disputes between the two great Powers. For one clear reason: they affect us all and not only the parties concerned. From our point of view, the present crisis in relations between the superPowers can be traced to two recent causes: the armed intervention of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; and the decision by NATO to install euro-missiles in response to the Soviet deployment of SS20 missiles.\n175.\tMy Government made clear its disagreement with the armed interference of one of those Powers in Afghanistan and continues to consider that that act, which violates the norms of international conduct, has largely contributed to creating a climate reminiscent of that of the cold war.\n176.\tMexico viewed with concern NATO's decision to install in Europe the Pershing and cruise missiles, a concern which we expressed to the Assembly last year. None the less, we consider that the other decision taken by NATO, inseparable in principle from the first, concerning the start of negotiations between the Warsaw Pact and NATO itself on nuclear disarmament in Europe, was encouraging. But today we must say how concerned we are to see that there has been a break in what should have been inseparable. At present there are no negotiations going on, nor can we discern the political will that would guarantee their success if they did take place. On the worst hypothesis, we see an unattainable desire to achieve military superiority by rearmament with warlike undertones. On the best hypothesis, we see the will to restore an allegedly lost military balance, solely by means of the arms race, including the use of the odious neutron bomb.\n177.\tWe ask the leaders of the great Powers: when are you going to start genuine negotiations? The peoples of the world have a right to call upon them to stop the escalation of their verbal exchanges and fruitless polemics, to stop provoking each other, to stop the new and absurd arms race and, above all, to stop intervention or threats of interference in the internal affairs of other countries, in (lie name of the crusade that each of the superPowers has undertaken against the other; a right to call upon them to start immediate negotiations, to begin a dialog at the highest level, between the Governments of the United States and of the Soviet Union. When the great Powers forget their responsibilities towards the international community, the other members of that community have the obligation to jog their memories.\n178.\tThat is so because, although it is true that a new war would have disastrous effects for all countries without exception, the present crisis is already affecting in the main the developing countries. This is the second major factor to which I referred earlier: the resurgence of opposition our peoples are meeting in their struggle to free themselves from internal and external structures of domination and injustice. We reject the argument that conflicts and zones of tension in Central America and the Caribbean, in southern Africa and in SouthEast and SouthWest Asia are merely a reflection of the rivalry and confrontation of the two great Powers. They are primarily a result of local conditions. However, it would be naive to shut one's eyes to the fact that this confrontation between the superPowers worsens local conflicts, which are the results of the struggles of peoples against injustice and oppression. The great Powers are injecting their conflict into existing tensions in the southern part of the world, exacerbating them and bringing them dangerously close to the international threshold.\n179.\tThat is true of what has recently been happening in Central America and the Caribbean and in southern Africa, the two areas of greatest tension at the moment, in our opinion, to which, of course, must be added the Middle East. We cannot understand the support that a country with exemplary democratic traditions is giving to the racist regime of South Africa and to its acts of aggression against the peoples of Namibia, a country illegally occupied, and of Angola, illegally invaded, in a desire to oppose the other superPower in a so-called strategic area. The only viable solution in southern Africa is respect for the genuine aspirations of the peoples of the region, secure and recognized borders for Angola and true independence for Namibia, and the ending of the apartheid regime in South Africa. If in the struggle to achieve those aspirations the peoples of the region do not receive support from the democratic countries of the West, then inevitably they will turn, as they have already done, to those who will indeed give them such support.\n180.\tThe mere presence or absence of one great Power or the other is not what really counts in giving a political description of a situation. The military presence of one or the other of them is not per se necessarily something good; nor would the presence of the other per se necessarily be something bad. Everything depends on what each one is up to. It is politically commendable 'to assist a country to fulfill its legitimate desire for independence and justice; it is not politically commendable to help an oppressive and repressive regime to maintain a people in subjection. We feel that that is true both for Namibia and for Afghanistan.\n181.\tThe situation in Central America and the Caribbean has also worsened seriously in the past year for the reasons I have just given. For some time now my Government has taken the view that all countries in the area or with interests in it must do everything possible to reduce these tensions, while maintaining that the only means of attaining that goal is to act on the basis of the legitimacy of the struggles being carried out in those countries. It is inconceivable that peace, democracy and prosperity can prevail in a region while longstanding structures of injustice and domination persist. The region being what it is, it is hard to see how such structures could be changed without any disturbance or struggle.\n182.\tIn the light of those comments, the Government of Mexico has developed a multifaceted policy towards the area, and its various facets are not always easily maintained in an overall approach. We have sought, on the one hand, to keep the lines of political communication open with all Governments in the area, and that would include meetings at .the presidential level. This has made it possible for us to hold talks and to exchange views on the Central American crisis and as far as possible to avoid any breakdown in communications between Governments which should be talking.\n183.\tThus we are taking part in programs of regional economic cooperation which, although they cannot of themselves resolve the present crisis, can help. That is the purpose of the San Jose Agreement, signed by Mexico and Venezuela, more than a year ago, concerning the supply of oil to the area on concessionary terms, an agreement which is the first step towards the possible achievement of the world energy plan proposed by President Lopez Portillo. We have always said that programs of economic assistance must be completely devoid of political discrimination; we have accordingly acted within the framework of the San Jos6 Agreement, and have therefore requested that there should also be action by those countries which met in Nassau in July of this year6 to seek ways of contributing to the real economic prosperity of the region.\n184.\tFurthermore, the Government of Mexico feels that the regional and world situation calls for closer links of friendship and solidarity with certain countries in the area. This is a fundamental and constant position in Mexico's foreign policy, and it could not be otherwise. We are bound to Cuba and Nicaragua because of a common origin: all three countries know what a revolution means, however different or divergent ours may have been. The Government of Mexico knows from experience what regional isolation resulting from such a revolution means. We also know what tensions can be caused through such isolation.\n185.\tTherefore on many occasions in the past year we have said at private meetings what we are saying today in the Assembly: the lack of communication between the Government of Cuba and that of the United States and the increasing deterioration in the dialog between Nicaragua and the United States are the basic causes of the Central American and Caribbean crisis. We state this with the force and authority conferred upon us by our excellent relations of friendship with both countries: as long as there are no talks, discussions or approaches between Cuba and the United States there can be no harmony in the area.\n186.\tWe continue to seek means to put an end to the bloody crisis in El Salvador. A short while ago, with the Government of France, we appealed to the international community to help find a political solution to the civil war raging in that country. Only a political solution can have the substance which can make it a just, viable and lasting settlement. A political solution means negotiations between the parties to the conflict. Hence, we recognize the organization set up by the opposition in the country of El Salvador, that is, the Frente de Liberation National Farabundo Marti and the Frente Democratico Revolucionario, as the representative political forces which have a legitimate right to take part in any negotiations.\n187.\tSome have said to us that such an acknowledgment is a matter of interference and, further, lacking in basis in so far as the forces of opposition do not form more than a small sector in the broad political spectrum. The Government of Mexico has summarized its position in three points.\n188.\tFirst, we do not accept pressures, whatever their provenance.\n189.\tSecondly, the appeal by Mexico and France for a negotiated political solution between the two parties to the conflict is not interference in the internal affairs of El Salvador.\n190.\tThirdly, as President Lopez Portillo has said, the best proof of strength, representably and popular support for the El Salvador opposition is to be found precisely in the fact that the Government junta has felt constrained to call for foreign intervention in order to retain power, and other countries have felt obliged to respond favorably to that request.\n191.\tTo our mind, it is a dangerous generalization to say that the problems of Latin America must be resolved by Latin. Americans, unless it is made quite clear that each country, and only that country, not its friends, neighbors or protectors, has the right to self-determination. Otherwise, we could be legitimizing self-appointed vigilante committees or regional watchdogs of a clearly interventionist nature, which would thus be unacceptable.\n192.\tWe agree that the conflict in El Salvador must not be a repetition of the tragedy of the Spanish war that is why we urge a negotiated settlement but if that were to happen, Mexico, just as 40 years ago, would be opposed to foreign intervention and would be on the side of the true interests of the people.\n193.\tMy country holds too dear the principles regulating its conduct and its sense of tradition to neglect its responsibilities. We shall continue on our chosen path together with friendly countries such as France and many others until reason triumphs. Mexico could not act otherwise and\nhas no reason to change its stand, today or tomorrow.\n\u00bb\n194.\tIf the confrontation between the two major Powers has served to hamper the endeavors of peoples to change their internal structures, it has also hindered any change in international economic relations.\n195.\tIn this regard, and before going into the essential matters of the global round and the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development which is to be held at Cancun, I must refer to the situation concerning the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The attitude of some industrialized countries, in particular the United States, to the achievements already recorded is a source of serious concern to my Government.\n196.\tWhen the international community began this negotiating process it did so in good faith, trusting that the time had come to regulate the oceans. Those negotiations, in which more than 150 sovereign States took part, were on the point of completion. We continue firmly to believe that within, the codification process there was and there continues to be the greatest endeavor ever undertaken.\n197.\tIf the work of so many years is today not acceptable to such countries, the entire multilateral negotiating process will be seriously affected, because it will be hard to ask us to start negotiations again with the same trust if we know in advance that the results of our labor may be undone by one or several countries taking part in the negotiating process.\n198.\tFurthermore, I consider that everyone should give more careful thought to the serious consequences if there is no convention. In our opinion, and in the opinion of almost all developing countries, the failure of some countries to sign, or even the failure to open a convention for signature, does not mean that the world can go back to the situation which prevailed before any attempt was made to draw up this convention; in other words, go back to the 1958 Geneva Conventions as if nothing had happened. This is a mistake. To our mind, the activity of the Conference and the extremely important agreements implicit in the articles drafted gave :rise to a great many practices among States, many of which undoubtedly had the nature of customs and led to genuine legal rules. But the lack of a convention will indeed be an enormous disadvantage, creating uncertainty and even chaos and anarchy in a field in which there is a vital need for the international community to have clarity and stability.\n199.\tI should like to avail myself of this opportunity to appeal to everybody to renew our efforts, complete negotiations and conclude a universal convention, which, as we see it, is the only way to find solutions to matters relating to the use of maritime resources.\n200.\tThe imperative heed to have effective answers to the pressing problems of the international economy is striking this thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly with unprecedented force. u\n201.\tAs it was 12 months ago, the Assembly is called upon to decide the fate of the most important initiative in multilateral economic negotiations taken in the first half of the 1980s: the global round of negotiations. Like other developing countries, Mexico has expressed its dismay and concern at the fact that almost two years have elapsed since the General Assembly adopted by consensus the resolutions on the global round [resolutions 34/138 and 341139] and as yet no agenda has been drawn up and no procedures have been defined for the conduct of such negotiations, so that they have not yet begun, despite the pressing and serious problems with which the negotiations will have to deal.\n202.\tIn taking this initiative of the global round, the General Assembly was fully aware that the path would not be an easy one. In the light of experience of multilateral economic negotiations, many countries were convinced that the success of the global negotiations would depend upon efforts being made at the same time, but independently, to meet the conditions which must be fulfilled in order to ensure that success. Those additional efforts were not only to facilitate agreements in the global round but were also to contribute to other negotiating bodies. They should be designed to mobilize the necessary political will to make effective progress, to recognize the new realities of the world economy and the consequences for international cooperation for development.\n203.\tIn view of this situation, Chancellor Kreisky of Austria and President Lopez Portillo of Mexico took the initiative of convening the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development at the level of heads of State or Government, which will be convened in Cancun within a month. As was clearly established in the consultations among the 11 countries which initially launched this initiative and as ratified by the 22 participants, the meeting seeks a political understanding at the highest level among heads of State or Government so that this international economic cooperation effort can begin without in any way claiming to prejudge or to replace our Organization as the natural forum for such negotiations.\n204.\tThis is the nature and the objective of the Cancun meeting: it represents an opportunity for informal talks of a political nature at the highest level in the search for understandings} also of an informal nature, which would clear the way for future negotiating efforts. These would be made easier because of a greater understanding of the\nsize, scope and modalities attendant upon the problems involved and would open new paths to action.\n205.\tIt can be argued and, indeed, it has been argued, that the difficult state of the world economy and the discouraging background of multilateral economic negotiating efforts do not augur well for this fresh endeavor. Perhaps we could have had a more propitious time, or perhaps we could have had more encouraging signs. The Government of Mexico nonetheless feels that the problems of cooperation and development call for urgent attention at the highest political level and that the present situation as well as the stalemate in multilateral economic negotiations and the limited progress made in international cooperation for development are powerful calls to action. So, once more, responsibilities will have to be assumed.\n206.\tThe international community as a whole will decide on how successful we are. But we are firmly convinced that, regardless of the results obtained, it will be recognized that no opportunity was lost for understanding and progress and that no efforts were spared in order to achieve that end.\n207.\tThe rather discouraging picture of the world today is for many a source of justifiable pessimism. The problems deriving from the worsening international economic crisis and the deterioration of the economic situation in many developing countries have been supplemented by the sharpness of the disagreements between the two major Powers based on attitudes which we thought were a thing of the past.\n208.\tDespite the efforts of many countries, viable and appropriate solutions to problems facing the international community seem to be fewer than ever. Hence, today more than at any time we must reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of this Organization and redouble our efforts to hold fast to common sense. Mexico will, for its part, continue with great realism along the only path it regards as reasonable: that of peace and negotiation.\n209.\tThis is how we acted in the forums dealing with disarmament and in the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea; thus we are proceeding at the Cancun meeting of 22 heads of State or Government, and thus we shall continue to behave in the case of El Salvador.\n210.\tThere is no problem without a solution. To find it depends on our will and our ability. Let us find the solution together.\n"

        "file_name": "AUT_36_1981.txt",
        "file_text": "137.\tMay I first extend to you my country's sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In view of the difficult tasks we face in the coming months, we are particularly happy to see the General Assembly guided by such an experienced diplomat, whose political experience, negotiating skill and conciliation ability are so widely respected.\n138.\tWe consider your election a tribute to you personally and to your country, to which Austria is linked by traditional bonds of friendship. Your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly also represents recognition of the role of the nonaligned movement by the whole international community. As a permanently neutral country, Austria considers the movement a very important factor in the stability of international relations. On its twentieth anniversary I would like to express to the non aligned movement the warmest congratulations on behalf of the Austrian Government.\n139.\tTo the SecretaryGeneral I wish to express my Government's sincere gratitude for his untiring work for world peace. We feel that it is precisely at a time of increased tension, of worldwide political and economic crises, that his experience is an invaluable asset to the community of States.\n140.\tWith the admission of Vanuatu and Belize, the Organization has increased its membership to an impressive total of 156 States. We congratulate very cordially the delegations of the new Member States and express our hope for close and fruitful cooperation.\n141.\tAt the thirty-first session [27th meeting] I had the honor to present Austria's position on the world situation to the General Assembly for the first time. The political climate at that time was still marked by the common desire of the United States and the Soviet Union to continue the policy of detente. There\\\" was good reason to hope that the principles adopted by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, held at Helsinki in 1975, would be respected in practice and would permeate all areas of international relations.\n142.\tMeanwhile, EastWest relations have gravely deteriorated. Distrust of each other's plans and intentions weighs heavily on the relations of the two superPowers, creating a worldwide feeling of insecurity. We hope, however, that both the talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and United States Secretary of State Haig and the beginning of the theater nuclear force negotiations this year at the end of November will lead to the resumption of a substantive dialog between the parties, based on the full realization of our common interests and their joint responsibility for world peace and survival.\n143.\tWe also hope that the follow-up conference to the Helsinki Conference, which has now been in session for more than a year, will be favorably influenced by the beginning of bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. So far, the negotiations in Madrid have taken place in a strained political climate. There exists a widespread pessimism on the possibility of solving the problems still pending with respect to the substantive final document.\n144.\tI do not share this pessimistic assessment. What has already been achieved, particularly in the areas of economic cooperation, humanitarian issues and information, is so important that it must not be lost. Moreover, the Helsinki process is too essential to Europe and to the world to be jeopardized. We should, therefore, devote all our energy to solving the remaining problems. Austria, in cooperation with the other neutral and the nonaligned States of Europe, will do everything possible to achieve meaningful results and ensure the continuation of that process.\n145.\tThe reasons why I am placing so much emphasis on United StatesSoviet relations lie in our conviction that the aims of the United Nations can be accomplished only if there exists a necessary minimum of cooperation and trust among all of its Members and, in particular, the major Powers.\n146.\tAn objective analysis of world political developments further strengthens our conviction that there is no meaningful alternative to a constructive, worldwide policy of detente, based on a stable balance of forces. This is the only sensible way to achieve secure coexistence and fruitful cooperation among States and peoples. It is the prerequisite for the gradual building of a world order in which the interests of the North, South, East and West are balanced and harmonized.\n147.\tWhen we speak of detente we mean a continuous, dynamic process in which conflict and cooperation among States with different political, economic and social systems interact. It does not mean the end of all conflicts.\n148.\tThe expression \\\"detente\\\" is perhaps misleading in so far as it gives rise to unjustified hopes. Perhaps in the future we should speak rather of a \\\"modus vivendi for coexistence and cooperation\\\". But, whatever expression we choose to denote this policy, we do not in any case see it as something abstract and remote. For us it is a concrete and tangible matter. We experience its consequences right on our doorstep, a few miles from our capital.\n149.\tOur relations with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the Federal Republic of Germany, Hungary and Yugoslavia are close and essentially free of problems. Our relations with Czechoslovakia, unfortunately, have not yet reached this stage and are overshadowed by a number of problems and events. However, our long common border and our human and cultural ties commit us to seek good-neighborly relations through pragmatic talks. Austria has a very great interest in good and friendly relations with Czechoslovakia. We understand from statements made by Czechoslovak leaders, confirmed yesterday [19th meeting] by the speech of the Foreign Minister, Mr. Chnoupek, that Czechoslovakia is guided by the same interests. On the basis of this common desire for understanding, it should not be difficult to find satisfactory solutions to existing problems.\n150.\tIn our relations with Italy, a country to which we are linked by good-neighborly and friendly relations, the problem of South Tyrol is of particular importance. It is now 12 years since Austria and Italy agreed on autonomy for South Tyrol. Nevertheless the fall implementation of that agreement is still pending. At the thirty-Fifth session [20th meeting] I informed the Assembly of the impatience of the South Tyrolean people and the increased concern of the Austrian Government about that delay. I regret that I must report today that the situation has not improved since and that no further substantial progress has been achieved.\n151.\tParticular emphasis has to be laid on a matter which is at the heart of the protection of any ethnic group, namely, the use of their mother tongue in the courts and in dealing with administrative authorities; two thirds of the South Tyrolean population still have no such guarantee. That means that one of the most important elements of the agreements between Austria and Italy has not yet been implemented.\n152.\tPrime Minister Spadolini, on assuming office, gave assurances before the Italian Parliament to implement the outstanding measures as quickly as possible and in close consultation with the representatives of the ethnic groups concerned. From those assurances and the efforts so far undertaken by the Italian Prime Minister we derive the expectation that, in the interest of all, substantial progress will be made in the near future. That would mean, in particular, the continuation of the process jointly initiated by the two countries in 1969, in consultation with the South Tyroleans. Otherwise, serious doubts would arise as to Italy's readiness and desire to comply with its commitments and to act in accordance with the guidelines set forth in General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI).\n153.\t1 am reporting on our policy of good-neighborliness because we believe that efforts to promote peace must begin at home and in our immediate vicinity. However, that does not relieve us of the duty to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security in all other regions as well, 'in view of today's realities and interdependence, destabilizing events in any part of the world have immediate repercussions around the globe. Austria is therefore greatly interested in the peaceful settlement of all conflicts and is ready to contribute actively to their solution.\n154.\tThe situation in the Middle East remains a major source of danger to world peace and alarms .us greatly. The ArabIsraeli conflict has escalated to a new and dangerous point. The Israeli actions in the south of Lebanon, the bombing of targets in Beirut and the attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad constitute new violations of international law. Israel's settlement policy and its attempt to bring about a one-sided change in the status of Jerusalem continue to create serious obstacles to a peaceful arrangement. There is still no solution in sight to the key problem of the Middle East conflict the Palestinian question. The fact that an agreement on a ceasefire in Lebanon, with the participation of the PLO, was possible and is still in force, establishes the validity of the basic tenets of our Middle East policy as presented to the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly by Chancellor Kreisky [49th meeting] and myself [9th meetingJ. Today we are more than ever convinced that a peaceful settlement in the Middle East can only be achieved on the basis of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinian people, represented by the PLO. Such talks might, at a later stage, lead to negotiations in a larger forum under the auspices of the United Nations.\n155.\tThe illegal occupation of Afghanistan continues to threaten the stability of the region and gravely hinders the policy of detente. In accordance with the position expressed by the overwhelming majority of the Members of the United Nations, Austria urges the withdrawal of all foreign troops and advocates a political solution which ensures the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan.\n156.\tThe explosive situation in the Middle East and the prominence attached to the question of Afghanistan in world public opinion must not cause us to forget the tragedy of the Kampuchean people, who have suffered human rights violations on an inconceivable scale, and foreign military intervention as well. Austria's feelings of solidarity and sympathy with Kampuchea are widely shared. That was clearly demonstrated by the large number of participants in the International Conference on Kampuchea. The recommendations of that Conference will be submitted to the General Assembly for endorsement.\n157.\tI should just like to reaffirm here what 1, as President of the Conference, consider its guiding principle: the Conference on Kampuchea is directed against no one; rather it is an attempt to contribute to a political settlement of the Kampuchean problem. One of its main functions is to initiate a dialog with the nonparticipating parties. May Make this opportunity to appeal to all of them to accept that invitation.\n158.\tSouth Africa's military invasion of Angola, which we condemn as a gross violation of the principles of the United Nations, has demonstrated once again the urgency of a solution to the problem of Namibia. The emergency special session of the General Assembly on Namibia again emphasized the Security Council's responsibility for the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia, endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978). While we understand and share the impatience of the African States, we still hope that the efforts of the Western contact group will yield results as soon is possible. It will indeed be a great day for the Organization when we can welcome an independent Namibia as a new Member State.\n159.\tThe tragic conflict between Iraq and Iran continues. We should like to encourage our SecretaryGeneral and his Special Representative, as well as the Islamic and the nonaligned States, to continue their efforts to promote an equitable settlement.\n160.\tThe importance of negotiations in resolving tensions and crises has been clearly underlined in Cyprus. We welcome the fact that the inter-communal talks, through the mediation of the SecretaryGeneral and his Special Representative, have been resumed and continue on a regular basis. We hope that on the basis of realistic proposals progress can be achieved towards a comprehensive settlement.\n161.\tHotbeds of international tension do not exist only in Asia and Africa. Events in Central America also cause particular concern. Social justice and political pluralism are conditions for improving the situation in that part of the world. Those conditions will only be achieved in cooperation with all the social and political forces of a country, including the opposition. That applies, in particular, to El Salvador. I hope that there too one of the most important principles of our Charter will be respected: the right of every people to determine its own future without outside intervention from any source whatsoever.\n162.\tThe principles that apply to Central America apply to Europe as well. Rill respect for the principle of self determination and noninterference is also urgently required with regard to the situation in Poland, a country whose fate is of particular concern to us. We are confident that the great Polish people, to whom Austria is tied by strong historic bonds, have the ability to solve their problems themselves, through their own efforts.\n163.\tThis brief review of the gravest international crises demonstrates how far removed we are from the: declared goals of the Organization peace, security and justice. The failure to achieve substantial results in three main areas disarmament, development and human rights is primarily responsible for our not having reached those goals.\n164.\tIn his annual report on the work of the Organization, the SecretaryGeneral rightly expressed his deep concern about the escalation of the arms race [see A/36/1, sect. V]. It is indeed a most disturbing fact that in the three years since the first special session of the General Assembly on disarmament we have failed to achieve any substantial progress, despite universal agreement on the urgency of the problem.\n165.\tHere we are facing a dilemma to which we have so far found no solution: the same Governments that advocate disarmament and arms control have no inhibitions about following the opposite course in their actual behavior, when they feel that their security so requires. Everybody agrees that in the long run disarmament would increase security. But, for the present, every State attempts to enhance its security by military means.\n166.\tNevertheless, there appears to be general support for disarmament as a process of progressive and balanced lowering of the level of armaments. In this context the verification of the actual military strength of the States concerned is of critical importance. The problem is how to determine and define military strength.\n167.\tI believe that uncertainty about the true military strength of States is one of the main reasons for the continuing arms race and for the failure to achieve balanced disarmament. If we succeeded in developing objective procedures for assessing and verifying the true level of armaments in the world, we could achieve tangible progress towards a balanced arms reduction. Existing international practice and institutions provide sufficient mechanisms for the establishment and evaluation of relevant facts. I should therefore like to propose that the United Nations study the possibility of making use of those or similar mechanisms in order to verify and evaluate the actual state of armaments on an objective basis. My delegation would appreciate reactions to this proposal and wishes to reserve the option of offering more specific details during this session.\n168.\tAustria is convinced that NorthSouth issues are a central element of world politics today. Even though at present the EastWest conflict seems to be the focus of world public , attention, it would be wrong to view the NorthSouth problem as a secondary one.\n169.\tIn dealing with the problems of development we should not look back to the past but rather towards the future, for which we ail bear a common responsibility.\n170.\tIn view of the unsatisfactory progress made in recent years, we fully understand the impatience and frustration of the developing countries. We therefore consider it a matter of urgency that agreement on global negotiations be reached at this session of the General Assembly.\n171.\tAlthough the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development scheduled to take place this month at Cancun is not formally linked to the global negotiations, we hope that it will have a positive influence on them and will provide the necessary political impetus.\n172.\tThe Meeting, which is to be jointly chaired by the President of Mexico, Mr. Lopez Portillo, and the Austrian Chancellor, Mr. Kreisky, is not a forum for negotiations. It is intended to provide an opportunity for an exchange of views at the highest level on the entire range of North South issues. We should not expect immediate substantive decisions from the summit. Instead, it is the idea of the summit to create a more positive political atmosphere for NorthSouth relations and thus to establish the political will needed to begin and conduct negotiations on a comprehensive policy for development and cooperation.\n173.\tAustria has always held the view that global economic questions can be considered in a meaningful and action oriented manner only if we also address the problems of energy. We therefore welcome the program of Action which the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy agreed on as a first important step by the United Nations in dealing with this question in the overall context of NorthSouth relations. We support all ideas and initiatives aimed at strengthening international energy cooperation. We therefore also favor the establishment of an energy affiliate of the World Bank.\n174.\tIt is our hope that this session of the General Assembly will also be able to contribute significantly to the promotion of the interests of the least developed countries. We support the Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.1\n175.\tThe United Nations plays a very important role in our quest for a world in which human rights and human dignity will be respected. His Holiness Pope John Paul II underlined this issue in his fundamental statement before the Assembly at the thirty-fourth session [17th meeting]. There is growing recognition that peace and human rights are indivisible. When human rights are not ensured, peace is endangered, and when there is no peace, human rights are jeopardized.\n176.\tViolations of human rights in various regions of the world, caused or aggravated by political and military conflicts and unrest, clearly illustrate this interrelationship. Human suffering often assumes catastrophic proportions. We are all aware of the growing tragic flows of refugees, of the spread of acts of senseless violence and terrorism, of arbitrary violations of human dignity, unjustified arrests, torture, the taking of hostages, forced resettlements and summary executions.\n177.\tIn this connection, I should like to submit to the General Assembly a proposal which was discussed in detail and generally endorsed by the Fourth Armand Hammer Conference, held at AixenProvence in August of this year. It deals with the creation of an international corps of trial observers to be set up within the United Nations system, whose duty would be to be present and report on legal proceedings in which human rights are affected. These observers should in no way replace or supersede the successful activities of nongovernmental organizations working in this field, but should supplement them in cases in which they are not accepted. We should welcome it if Member States made their views on this proposal known to us, so that we could follow it up in the Third Committee of the General Assembly with these reactions in mind.\n178.\tAmong the many violations of human rights which we are witnessing, let me refer to two in particular.\n179.\tWe are witnessing today a resurgence of the death penalty, the most inhuman punishment, which is also only too often applied in contravention of the basic principles of criminal procedure. We fully support all efforts to abolish that penalty and congratulate France on the decision recently taken in this regard.\n180.\tLikewise, we note a growing and alarming tendency to religious intolerance in many parts of the world. We welcome any action to counter this inhuman trend. All those advocating intolerance are obstacles to peace.\n181.\tI am firmly convinced that the problems of today can be resolved only be peaceful change. This principle is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and is at the basis of all peace efforts. All of us States, Governments, international organizations and individuals as well must accept this challenge.\n"

        "file_text": "\n195.\tI am indeed gratified to see an illustrious son of Iraq, with which my country enjoys the most cordial relations, assuming the high office of the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I offer to Mr. Kittani my Government's warmest congratulations. His election is a testimony to the special position and respect that he enjoys in the international community and a tribute to him as an outstanding diplomat.\n196.\tIn welcoming his election, may I express at the same time our heartfelt thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, for the outstanding manner in which he conducted the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and the emergency special session on Namibia to a successful conclusion.\n197.\tI should also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Government of Malaysia, to congratulate warmly General Carlos Romulo, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines, who earlier this month was bestowed the highly honored and much coveted United Nations Peace Award. It is indeed most fitting. As a member of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN], my Government considers this a matter of pride and glory.\n198.\tWe have at this thirty-sixth session one new Member of the Organization. It is a great privilege for me to welcome on behalf of my delegation the Republic of Vanuatu, and Malaysia looks forward in delightful anticipation to the admission of Belize. By joining us in this august body as a full-fledged Member, Vanuatu has, like all new Members, made an important contribution towards the universality of the United Nations. Malaysia pledges its commitment to work together with our new friends in everything to which the Organization is dedicated.\n199.\tNearly four decades ago, following the deliberations in Dumbarton Oaks, 50 countries gathered in San Francisco to draft the Charter of the United Nations. Having just witnessed the ravages of the Second World War and the suffering that mankind had undergone, they manifested in the Dumbarton Oaks deliberations a new spirit infused with the ideal that they should be united in their determination to ensure positive cooperation in the cause of peace and social justice.\n200.\tSince then the world has undergone major changes. While the ranks of independent developing nations grow each year, we do not see a corresponding advance in development and social justice. Hence the just demands of developing countries for an equitable share of the wealth of the world, access to the benefits of modern technology and scientific knowhow and participation in decision-making on global issues that affect the general wellbeing of mankind. Unfortunately, the realization of those demands has been entwined with the complexities of EastWest relations. Herein lies the challenge of our times: the solution of the NorthSouth dichotomy must be isolated from the vicissitudes of EastWest relations.\n201.\tIn the complexity of the situation, should we not now ask ourselves, where is the spirit of Dumbarton Oaks, which inspired the authors of the Charter? It would seem to me that the progress, wealth and power acquired during the postwar years by the industrialized nations of the East and the West alike have neutralized the moral and ethical values which the authors of the Charter tried to espouse. Even now, this Hall echoes with the reiteration of their commitments which, however, stand in sharp contrast to the reality in the world today.\n202.\tInstead, there is the increasing tendency to use force in international relations. Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, the Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea, the Chinese incursion into Viet Nam, that of South Africa into Namibia and of Israel into Iraq and Lebanon provide only a few, but nevertheless glaring, examples of this, though more subtle interventions have taken place in other parts of the world. Only yesterday we witnessed the violent overflow of the Afghanistan problem into the streets of New York, in front of this building, this magnificent edifice. This is a clear testimony of one of our failures.\n203.\tThese developments, amidst longstanding conflicts in West Asia and southern Africa, further heighten international tension. Indeed, the breakdown of detente and the revival of the cold war will certainly have destabilizing effects in the global context. This could well increase the danger of the developing nations being sucked into the vortex of superPower conflict, with grave ramifications for their peace, their security and their economic wellbeing. These are our fears and our concerns. Are these not issues that we, States Members of the United Nations, must continue to reflect upon and must continue to face squarely?\n204.\tBoth solutions are called for. Suggestions have been made for a return to detente. But the detente of the 1960s and the 1970s, which essentially sought to stabilize EastWest relations in Europe through a policy of mutual restraint and accommodation, failed to regulate the behavior of major Powers in the third-world countries. Herein lies the weakness of detente, a concept so different in meaning and so different in objectives as held by one or the other Power, which limited its applicability to a narrow part of the globe, leaving the other parts open to unrestrained political and ideological pressure. Detente or peaceful coexistence as a method is continuously being deployed to further ideological aims, creating disaffection and rebellion in order to overthrow legitimate governments. This is being done surreptitiously. Not only do we in SouthEast Asia have to reckon with such problems, which drain our resources and energy, but we also face a rather bizarre situation, wherein our hands are being shaken by a Government in the name of friendship, yet the political party from which that Government is formed as if there were a real dichotomy declares to us openly to our faces its commitments to continue to support, albeit morally and politically, illegal and terrorist groups that are striving daily to overthrow by violent means our respective Governments. Such a blatant declaration and unashamed admission is made in the name of honesty and ideological rivalry as if we were all nincompoops. We in Malaysia regard this as a policy of serving rotten fish in the specialized recipe of a sweet and sour dish. O spirit of Dumbarton Oaks, hast thou .become a ghost?\n205.\tThe failure of detente also drove home the point that besides needing common understanding and a common interpretation among its so-called adherents, any formula for longterm global stability must necessarily include the participation of the third-world countries. Their role in the scheme of global stability can no longer be ignored. Their participation in decision-making is a prerequisite for the solution of all those pressing problems confronting us today. This is all the more relevant in the context of finding solutions to the many economic and political issues besetting the United Nations.\n206.\tOn the economic front, in the developing countries the spectrum of increased unemployment and little or negative growth in an already difficult situation is more than worrying. But when such difficulties coincide with what is perceived as renewed intransigence on the part of the developed countries in opposing the urgent need of the developing nations for a more equitable economic system, the result can only be a sense of betrayal. A feeling of hopelessness arising out of the lack of progress in the NorthSouth dialog could breed desperate acts. This dangerous dimension is something which all of us must constantly bear in mind.\n207.\tHowever, desperate acts are not the solution for the current economic ills of the world. A framework has already been laid with the adoption by the Assembly in 1974 of the Declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)] and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. The various plans of action and codes of conduct and the targets envisaged for the International Development Strategy that we have collectively adopted in the last few years would be a good basis for meaningful international economic cooperation. What is needed is the will to translate the program into reality. This is oUr collective responsibility. We must have the courage to fulfill that responsibility.\n208.\tVery often the best intentions of Governments to assist developing countries are frustrated by built in domestic constraints. This must be overcome. As one idea, Governments of developed and capital surplus countries, as well as other developing nations able to do so, might consider depositing a capital sum, the interest on which should be pledged to the human resources program of UNDP. The capital sum so deposited anywhere would continue to belong to the donor countries and could be withdrawn for some compelling reason. It is the interest accruing that would be pledged. The focus of the activity would be the development of human resources, which is the essential prerequisite for any longterm development. Malaysia has recently proposed such a scheme and indeed has committed itself to contributing to the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation. One main advantage of this proposal is that donor countries could contribute to this program without the need to go through the rigmarole of seeking fresh annual allocations from their respective Parliaments. I should like to suggest most humbly that this thought be studied seriously.\n209.\tWhile such endeavors must go on, our attention will have to focus also on the other pressing political problems which have eluded solutions year in and year out.\n210.\tThe situation in West Asia, of which the question of Palestine forms the core, has long defied solution. Contrary to the spirit of Dumbarton Oaks, the aspirations of the people concerned have not received the recognition to which they are entitled. Any solution that fails to take into account the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and national independence will not succeed in bringing about peace in West Asia. Negotiations to resolve the problem must include the most responsible party, in this case the PLO. We are gratified that, except for a handful of countries, the international community has come to accept and recognize the PLO for what it is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. As our contribution, my Government has decided to grant full diplomatic status to the representative of the PLO in Malaysia.\n211.\tApartheid, an inhuman system imposed on the people of South Africa, is yet another example of the gross violation of the principles of the Charter. Despite universal condemnation of such a despicable colonialist system at its worst, a handful of Governments still continue to defy the most basic obligation to demonstrate their abhorrence of the system. For instance, their unwillingness to discourage their own citizens from making contacts with the sporting organizations of South Africa is symptomatic of this attitude. Of course, no one is expected to violate the individual constitutional right to play whatever games are allowed by law or to prevent citizens from going abroad to contact South African teams in the field of sport. But if a Government were serious enough about showing its abhorrence of apartheid, it could perform a meaningful political act of discouragement by exercising the absolute right of its executive to deny visas to citizens of South Africa as members of visiting teams coming into the country with the advertised aim of making contact with the citizens in sporting activities. Governor Carey of New York aptly said a couple of days ago, as I read in the newspapers, that sport in South Africa is an arm of the system of apartheid. Therefore, any Government which provides visas to any individual or sporting team from South Africa is, to say the least, merely paying lip service and standing in the chorus line against apartheid.\n212.\tThe Charter of the United Nations holds the promise of freedom and independence for all peoples, and yet today we see a conglomerate of interest groups deliberately obstructing the process of decolonization. But the United Nations must be true to its purposes. We must exert greater efforts to hasten the completion of this process so that all peoples still under colonial rule can enjoy their inherent and legitimate rights without further impediments. In this context, Malaysia would be satisfied with any decolonization program, in certain circumstances, where power was returned to the authority from which it had been wrestled.\n213.\tIn Namibia, we witness South Africa clinging to the Territory in defiance of the clear ruling of the International Court of Justice of 21 June 197110 and the demands of the international community. Efforts by the United Nations to bring about a peaceful transition to independence for the Territory have so far failed because of the continuing intransigence of South Africa, which continues its policy with impunity only because it feels confident that those Governments or countries in a position to exercise the necessary pressure will not, in the final analysis, do so, as we have just seen in the gambols and frolics of the Springboks.\n214.\tThe Indian Ocean is another potential area for big Power conflict. In their desire to retain the strategic advantages that the/ possess in the area, the big Powers are unwilling to respond positively to the call of the littoral and hinterland States for the early implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. This must surely be a matter of concern to all peace-loving States.\n215.\tWest Asia, South Africa, Namibia and the Indian Ocean are but a few examples where progress in the direction of peace has been hampered because major Powers choose to act in defiance of the principles of the Charter and the expressed will of the international community. This is hardly surprising when solutions to these problems continue to be viewed in the context of EastWest global strategy, as opposed to the national and regional interests of .he countries concerned.\n216.\tComing from SouthEast Asia, where dealing with external pressures has become a fact of life, as I mentioned earlier, we have shown our conviction, by our espousal of the concept of the zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, that regional peace and security are best assured by recognizing the legitimate interest of all major Powers in maintaining peaceful relations with the countries of the region. It is within this framework that we are pursuing our efforts to ensure peace and stability in SouthEast Asia.\n217.\tThe recent International Conference on Kampuchea, held in this very Hall in July this year on the initiative of the member States of ASEAN, in order to pave the way for a comprehensive political solution of the Kampuchean situation, represents a collective effort by the five SouthEast Asian States to ^contribute to regional peace and security within the framework of the zone of peace, freedom and neutrality and the principles of the\nif Charter of the United Nations. The Declaration and the resolution adopted by the Conference sought neither to punish nor to ostracize any State. On the contrary, the Conference wished to ensure that the fears and threats, real or imagined, that led to the events in Kampuchea were removed, so that the situation in that country could return to normal. The Declaration and the resolution represent a consensus that Viet Nam cannot ignore and provide a basis for further negotiations that could obviate the concern of all.\n218.\tIn the search for an early solution to the problem, we are encouraged by the recent meeting in Singapore of Mr. Son Sann, Prince Sihanouk and Mr. Khieu Samphan, who have declared their intention to form a coalition government. The fact that they have been able to come together is an important development. It represent a vital Step towards the early political settlement of the problem. We are gratified to note that the three parties are now seriously discussing the implementation of their Singapore declaration. We are confident that if patience and sincerity are shown by the parties concerned, these efforts will pave the way for a comprehensive political solution.\n219.\tIf ASEAN has been taking a strong lead in the search for a solution to the Kampuchean problem, it is because we see the issue, in the context of the zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, as central to the larger issue of peace and security in the region. The escalation of the conflict in Kampuchea, and in particular its spillover to neighboring countries, can have grave ramifications for international peace and security. For us, a divided SouthEast Asia is an unstable SouthEast Asia, for it will continue to be an open invitation to external interference and manipulations. The removal of the seeds of discord and suspicion is uppermost in our mind.\n220.\tIt is in the context of ensuring peace and stability in SouthEast Asia that we seek a solution to the Indochinese refugee problem, which has burdened neighboring countries. The \\\"push and pull\\\" factors that have brought about the current boat people problem must be tackled at the source. Countries of first transit that are already burdened with all kinds of difficulties should not be allowed to suffer residual problems by the unwillingness of third countries to absorb refugees for final settlement. We seek concrete measures both at the source and in countries of final settlement.\n221.\tIt must be apparent to the source country that it is being drained of its best manpower and therefore should prevent such an exodus instead of driving the people out. On the other hand, other countries and their mass media should do nothing to encourage such an exodus. The pull must be replaced by some measures which could serve as a humane deterrent. In this context, I should like to express, on behalf of my Government, our deep appreciation to UNHCR for doing sterling service in this thankless job. Also I should like to thank countries of final settlement for their understanding and generosity. In this regard the final settlement of refugees has become one of the strong pillars in the relationship between ASEAN and those countries.\n222.\tWhile Malaysia is concerned with the question of regional peace and security, we are not unmindful of other dangers that sap the energies of nations and threaten their very political, social and security fabric. The wide spectrum of issues on the agenda of this session reflects in varying degrees the dimension of the dangers that we face today. An area that is of concern to Malaysia and one that impinges on our general wellbeing and security is drug abuse. It has become a global problem that no nation can ignore and no nation alone can tackle. It is time the United Nations adopted a new conceptual approach to this problem.\n223.\tIn my address at the sixth special session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, held at Vienna from 11 to 20 February 1980, I emphasized the grave danger of drug abuse to national security, stability and resilience and said that it was not just a neighborhood problem. The time has come to rethink the approach that the international community must take in dealing with this menace. It must be given a high priority and seen in the right perspective. Such an approach demands that the question of drug abuse be looked at as a security problem that has the potential of destabilizing societies and nations and not merely as a social and humanitarian problem.\n224.\tIn this regard, I welcome the item proposed by Bolivia, entitled \\\"International campaign against traffic in drugs\\\" [item 129]. It is our view that while the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the Economic and Social Council can continue to look at the humanitarian and social aspects of the problem of drug abuse, the political and security aspects of the problem could best be considered by the Special Political Committee. Let us invite the Assembly to give serious and urgent attention to this problem.\n225.\tWith reference to international relations, these are our hopes, our fears and in many ways our disappointments. We, for our part, will continue to be earnest in our approach and serious in our endeavors. Our hope for the future lies not in paying lip service or just standing in the chorus line, but in the honest implementation of practical programs in the spirit of Dumbarton Oaks, which inspired the Charter of the United Nations that we are all pledged to uphold.\n"

        "file_text": "115.\t It was with shock that we learned yesterday of the heinous and brutal death of the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt. Mankind as a whole must feel in the very depth of its soul and heart this great and irreparable loss. Africa has lost one of its great political figures. Sadat was a man of history, and history has claimed him. The delegation of the Central African Republic wishes to associate itself with the feelings that have been expressed in these sad circumstances and to offer its most heartfelt condolences to the delegation of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n116.\tI should like at the outset of my statement before this gathering of persons bearing immense responsibilities for the destiny of mankind to transmit the wishes for full success and signal achievement addressed to it by General of the Army Andre Kolingba, President of the Military Committee for National Reconstruction and Head of State, who has full confidence and great faith in the future of the United Nations.\n117.\tIt is a message of peace and hope that he sends through this political gathering to the whole of the international community, so that tomorrow's horizon may be clearer, more serene, more peaceful and more promising for the total fulfillment of all peoples in freedom, justice and independence. It is a message of peace and hope encompassing the concerns of mankind, with which the Assembly is dealing for the purpose of finding, in the spirit of consultation and of resolve typical of it, timely solutions to the conflicts and tension which threaten the stability of our world.\n118.\tIn keeping with custom and tradition, I should like now to express the proud satisfaction of the Central African Republic at seeing a great and worthy son of the Republic of Iraq presiding over the present meetings of the General Assembly.\n119.\tMr. President, your efforts and your personal action to ensure that our debates will proceed with tolerance and in harmony are a valuable and encouraging contribution to the success of this session.\n120.\tThe Republic of Iraq and the Central African Republic are maintaining relations woven and strengthened through their membership in the group of States that were formerly oppressed and, therefore, are present at all the struggles for political, cultural and economic emancipation.\n121.\tHence the Central African Republic for its part remains convinced that this session will provide another opportunity to demonstrate the vitality and the depth of that will to collaborate and to cooperate that have always been the hallmark of the friendship and fraternity between the two countries.\n122.\tI should also like to express to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, the outgoing President, our total satisfaction with the competence and effectiveness with which he guided the work of previous sessions.\n123.\tI wish also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the SecretaryGeneral for his dedication to the service of the United Nations.\n124.\tFinally, I wish to affirm here the constant readiness of the Central African Republic to establish the conditions of beneficial cooperation with Vanuatu and Belize, whose admission to the United Nations, which we warmly welcome, increases the Organization'' ability to deal with the various problems confronting it.\n125.\tAs I have just emphasized, the theme of the message which the Central African Republic wishes to transmit to the General Assembly is a triptych the three panels of which are freedom, security and development.\n126.\tFreedom, security and development are three essential concepts for us because they inspire all political action based on nobility and generosity; three concepts which today are acquiring by their relevance a special character and by their gravity a singular tone.\n127.\tFreedom is an expression whose depth, nobility and grandeur are mingled and frequently confused in mythology. It has inspired and continues to inspire every reappraisal of an economic and socio-political order. It sets its indelible seal on many of our mottoes, constitutions and coats-of-arms. It is to be found at the beginning and at the end of all our actions.\n128.\tAnd yet, how fragile it remains in our hearts and how precarious in our spirits, threatened and violated by our actions! Subtle confiscation of political and economic power, violence, terrorism, moral poverty all are constants which daily infringe the freedom of those who are powerless in the face of the uncertainties of a disorganized, conditioned and mechanized world.\n129.\tDeriving all profit possible from an international order fundamentally in their favor, the rich are skilfully channeling their disorders and aggressiveness towards others abroad.\n130.\tThreatened and violated at home, our freedom is daily the object of manipulation, constraint and domination. Our poverty, which is maintained by legend, is the convenient support for legitimizing the constant violation of our freedom, which is always supervised, always precarious. In the name of a world stability established without us and against us, we are daily the victims of blackmail, destabilization, aggression and annexation.\n131.\tIn Africa, in Asia and in Latin America, none of our lands, none of our waters, none of our skies, is sheltered from threat or from force.\n132.\tAngola, Lebanon, Cyprus, Korea, Afghanistan, Democratic Kampuchea are so many sad and tragic examples of the human conscience trampled on and violated by dangerous external interference with no other justification than the aggressive resurgence of ideological propensities to subjugation and moral, political, economic or racial domination.\n133.\tOur unswerving attachment to the freedom we have won at the price of great sacrifices, and the scrupulous preservation of our diversities but also of our complementarities, demand of us more insistently than ever not to yield to bargaining and intimidation. Nevertheless, this conviction must not give the impression of the defense of a refuge, of an illusory retreat into ourselves.\n134.\tWe sincerely and profoundly believe in international solidarity and in the virtues essential for world dialog, on the one and only condition that there is strict respect for our respective values and our identities. A dialog that ignores this precondition is synonymous with domination; it destroys understanding, sows distrust, produces confrontation and engenders war.\n135.\tThis freedom we seek for our independent States is something we claim even more insistently for the peoples of Namibia, East Timor and all those that in sweat and blood accept martyrdom for the liberation of their homelands. Our freedom will have real value and genuine significance only when it is extended and amplified by that of the peoples still under colonial or racist domination.\n136.\tIn the same context, we most earnestly call for a speedy solution to the problems of Western Sahara, Mayotte and the conflict between Iran and Iraq. Upon our capacity to solve those crises by dialog, and within appropriate regional or international institutions, depend our strength and credibility in all negotiations that we conduct for our survival and our collective security.\n137.\tSecurity is another panel of the triptych which has always underlain all action, peaceful or, otherwise, inspired the founding States of the United Nations at San Francisco, and today remains the primary concern of all our States. And yet many great clouds are still darkening the sky of security and peace.\n138.\tAggressive and unbridled rivalry in the world leadership is no longer held in check by the precarious but highly salutary balance of peace and security. The growing control of the seas and oceans for strategic purposes, allied to an unprecedented proliferation of military bases, the increase in expenditure resulting from the dangerous refining of the concept of balance of power, the impasse in international negotiations on disarmament and on the rational use of the common resources of mankind, the brutal recourse to violence and the unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of weak States these are some of the dangers that must be averted as we approach the dawn of the new century.\n139.\tThe delegation of the Central African Republic considers that Democratic Kampuchea and Korea are, among others, two obvious cases of a most alarming situation which endangers international peace and security.\n140.\tIt is therefore essential for any. satisfactory settlement to be based on the withdrawal of all foreign forces from those countries, the preservation and restoration of their sovereignty and territorial integrity and the determination of their destiny solely in accordance with the will of their peoples.\n141.\tIt is hardly necessary to point also to the grave threats to international peace and security in southern Africa, Cyprus, Lebanon and Afghanistan. To ignore these situations would be a capitulation by the universal conscience which we represent and to turn aside from it would be to risk a holocaust that would spare none.\n142.\tEar be it from us to plunge into excessive pessimism and fatalism. We profoundly believe in the moral capacity of man and in his striking ability to look back into his past in order to exercise more control over his future. That is how to measure the progress, Uneven but amazing, which mankind continues to achieve.\n143.\tI should like now to deal with the third panel of the triptych, which concerns development. Since the sixth special session of the General Assembly, in 1974, the international community has been growing more aware of the phenomenon of the economic interdependence of States and their common destiny.\n144.\tThe collapse of the present monetary system, inflation, and the energy and food crises have in these past few years highlighted the reality of this interdependence and have led to the convening of numerous conferences whose purpose was to install a new framework for economic relations based on the principles of equity and the sovereignty of all States.\n145.\tTo be sure, the international community has taken action-oriented decisions intended to trigger the process of correcting existing injustices, reducing the growing gap between developed and developing countries and facilitating the economic and social advancement of the latter. But even today, at the beginning of the Third United Nations Development Decade, we see that unfortunately very little has been done, because of the selfishness and lack of political will of most of the industrialized countries.\n146.\tThus, various uncertainties continue to loom over the economy of the countries of the third world: the instability of the international monetary system constantly and seriously disrupts their balance of payments and constantly puts their exports at a disadvantage on the world market, while their import prices are increasing disproportionately. In addition there are obstacles of all kinds imposed by various protectionist measures.\n147.\tThe absence of financial means and the insufficiency of the real transfer of resources and technology further increase the dependence of developing countries and their debt-servicing costs. Today this situation has deteriorated to an extent that calls for the immediate implementation of the decisions already adopted to remedy the inequalities of the present economic system.\n148.\tThe Central African Republic accordingly welcomes the adoption last year by the General Assembly of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [resolution 35/56], and the adoption of the Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries by the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which was held at Paris from 1 to 14 September 1981. The Government of the Central African Republic wishes to appeal to the conscience of the rich countries to implement fully the important measures decided on as a result of those meetings.\n149.\tYet I cannot conceal my country's concern at the delay in the launching of the global negotiations which should, in principle, have started last January but which have not, as a result of continuing differences on questions of procedure and timetable. Nevertheless, I hope that the forthcoming International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, at Cancun, will produce a useful compromise capable of satisfying all the parties concerned in the NorthSouth dialog.\n150.\tThe Central African Republic, for its part, will make its contribution to all the noble battles for equality, social justice and development.\n151.\tAnd now, before concluding my statement, 1 should like to draw the General Assembly's attention to the situation prevailing in my country, two years after the fall of the empire and the restoration of the Republic.\n152.\tSince the historic date of 1 September last, the Central African people, still suffering in body and spirit from the nightmare of 14 long years of a vile and wretched dictatorship, has called on its army to shape a new destiny which is more in keeping with its basic concerns. It could no longer remain silent and accept politicians who for two years had left the country bogged down in a serious economic, social and political crisis, in anarchy and disorder, with inevitable inclinations to destabilization. Nor could it any longer agree to shed its blood once more in face of the total incompetence of the last decaying regime, and the stupidity and irresponsibility of the various political parties.\n153.\tThat was why, in response to an urgent and distressed appeal, the Army, which was the sole remaining guarantor of the nation's vital interests, took power without any bloodshed. Invested with this mission for a limited period, the Army suspended the Constitution of 2 February 1981 and the activities of all the political parties and undertook a vigorous program of national reconciliation, made essential by the dangers and tensions that were tearing our country apart and that contained all the. seeds of an inevitable civil war. The improvement thus undertaken is designed to produce a new framework for a genuine democratic society where freely accepted consultation will ever remain the ideal of all Central African citizens.\n154. Deeply aware that nothing lasting can be done without freedom, security and peace, the Military Committee for National Rehabilitation, set up by General of the Army Kolingba, has likewise proclaimed its faith in the principles and ideals of the United Nations, in the QAU, in the nonalignment movement and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n155 That is why it has undertaken to respect all international obligations entered into earlier, thereby showing its permanent readiness to pursue and deepen the relations of friendship and cooperation with all the States which love peace and justice, with due regard for its national sovereignty. It sees therein the essential conditions which could contribute to the rehabilitation and rapid development of the Central African Republic.\n156.\tAs members are aware, the reign of the dictator Bokassa, which was characterized by irrational exploitation, a systematic plundering of our natural resources and an anarchic management of public property, plunged the country into an unprecedented economic and financial crisis. Thus production as a whole has fallen by about 50 per cent as compared with 1971.\n157.\tThe transport and communications networks have deteriorated completely for lack of maintenance, thereby bringing about, especially in the case of the road networks, the paralysis of collection and marketing systems for agricultural products.\n158.\tWith regard to the financial situation, poor management caused by uncontrolled withdrawals and unproductive expenditures has led to a budgetary deficit of more than $46 million, out of a budget of $108 million, while the cumulative debt now amounts to $248 million.\n159.\tThe social and educational sectors have not been spared. Together with the constant depreciation in purchasing power and the continuous impoverishment of the population there has been a total degradation of the health and educational services and infrastructure, which were already inadequate, thereby leading to an increase in disease, a rise in the rate of dropouts and a growing deficiency in the training of technicians.\n160.\tAlthough a biennial plan for economic and social improvement for 19801981 was established by the previous regime, the situation has scarcely changed. Indeed, it has deteriorated as a result of the inadequacy of financial means and the failure to carry out the program set up.\n161.\tThat is why the primary task assigned to the Military Committee for National Reconstruction is the reordering of the economy, with the following principal objectives: the improvement of public finances, agricultural and pastoral development to ensure food self-sufficiency and the necessary income for the rural population, the reconstruction of the road network to ensure permanent communication between the provinces and between the provinces and the capital and the rehabilitation and establishment of educational and health institutions.\n162.\tIt goes without saying that, to enable the Military Committee to carry out this minimum emergency program, and taking into account the dire situation which I have just described, external assistance is essential. Accordingly, I should like to address an appeal from this rostrum to the international community in general, and to friendly countries in particular, for financial and technical assistance, so that the Central African Republic may be able to achieve its priority goals.\n163.\tIt is in this context also that I think it very useful to recall resolution 35/87 of 5 December 1980, in which the General Assembly:\n\\\"Urgently appeals to all Member States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system and international economic and financial institutions to contribute generously, through bilateral or multilateral channels, to the reconstruction, rehabilitation and development of the Central African Republic\\\".\n164.\tThe Military Committee strongly hopes that the international program of financial, technical and material assistance advocated in that resolution will be established as soon as possible.\n165.\tLastly, I should like to thank all the States Members of the United Nations and international organizations which have already made their contribution to the implementation of that resolution.\n166.\tThe irony of fate is such that my country, which is classified among the least advanced countries of the world, is moreover also landlocked and thereby is confronted with enormous difficulties. But fate has also made it a land of the future, thanks to its great economic potential, the greater part of which is as yet untapped. It is for this reason that the Central African Republic is opening its doors to all investors and urges them to come in large numbers to exploit the enormous possibilities which it offers to them.\n167.\tthirty-six years after San Francisco, we must reflect on the future of the Organization and define the new course which the Member States must follow in order to correct the errors of the past. Our hope is to establish a new world, a world of peace, free from all anxiety and all threats of war. It is a hope as well as faith in the future of mankind, which must convince the strong as well as the weak, the rich as well as the poor, of the indissoluble nature of the common destiny of man.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, please accept my warm congratulations on your election to this responsible office. I wish you and the SecretaryGeneral success in your endeavors.\n182.\tWe also thank the President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. von Wechmar, for his work, which was certainly not an easy task.\n183.\tOur good wishes go to Vanuatu and Belize, as new Members of the United Nations.\n184.\tInternational events since the preceding session of the General Assembly have alerted the peoples to the urgent need to defend world peace with all determination. A wave cf escalating armament and militarization in international affairs is flooding the world and is threatening to wash away the still uncompleted foundation for a stable peace. War has become a real danger again. Reactionary quarters are taking even nuclear war into consideration as an aspect of their policy. It is therefore imperative for all peace-loving people and for the United Nations to steer international developments into the calm waters of dispassionate and mutually beneficial cooperation in the interests of coexistence and of humanity's survival.\n185.\tToday there is nothing more important than the prevention of a global conflagration, which would be a nuclear one. That means stopping the arms race, reducing tensions and, through patient dialog, seeking solutions to the complex problems facing humanity.\n186.\tThe German Democratic Republic remains committed to peace, peaceful coexistence and international detente. The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity forty of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic, Erich Honecker, said at the Party's tenth Congress:\n\\\"The peoples . . . should not have to go about their daily business under the threat of war, but in a secure atmosphere of peace, which should finally become their normal way of life.\\\"\nThus, my country's position is in harmony with the Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental resolutions of the Organization.\n187.\tThere is no acceptable alternative to the policy of detente. That is borne out by contemporary developments. Detente stood its practical test in the 1970s; it proved useful to the peoples and put neither side at a disadvantage. Confrontation and preparation for war make all States and peoples suffer, irrespective of their social system.\n188.\tIn the late 1960s and during the 1970s, international relations moved towards normalization on the basis of an approximate military balance between the States of the Warsaw Treaty and those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. That balance, born out of a need for equal security, continues to exist and it is an irresponsible and dangerous exercise to seek strategic nuclear superiority. It is well known that socialism sees the guarantee of world peace not in the accumulation of more and more horrible weapons, but only in the reduction and elimination of armed forces and armaments as a result of determined negotiations.\n189.\tIn view of the fact that stockpiles of nuclear weapons now exist with a destructive power 1.5 million times that of the bombs the United States dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, the decision in favor of a responsible policy that will strengthen peace should not be difficult to take. Indifference would be fatal.\n190.\tThe magnitude and diversity of the challenges require great efforts and comprehensive approaches by the United Nations. Particularly now, the specific significance of political dialog on all levels and in all fields is highlighted. Meetings of statesmen at the top level are desirable and useful. For a long time it has been proved that that is the suitable way to reduce distrust, to gain confidence and to find understanding. The socialist countries are prepared for that, as they have always been, provided there is respect for sovereign equality.\n191.\tNow, more than ever, the peoples expect the United Nations to exploit all the potential of the Charter to settle international problems. Hence the German Democratic Republic supports the Soviet Union's proposal that a special session of the Security Council be convened at the highest level. We believe that it would be rewarding to all sides and all peoples for there to be frank discussion in the Security Council of the global political issues.\n192.\tIt should be stated here that the willingness of States to strengthen international peace and security by way of negotiations and international agreements is not and cannot be a favor by one side to the other, and therefore it cannot be the object of any deals, let alone a means of extorting accommodating conduct. The point is to fulfill a legal duty which flows from the Charter of the United Nations and a host of international instruments. Negotiation is the highest moral imperative for everybody who does not want to shoot.\n193.\tdialog and negotiation should primarily be oriented towards halting the arms race in all its dimensions. This means ceasing to develop and produce nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and reducing the existing arsenals of weaponry; this means preventing the geographical spread of armaments and reducing them in the individual regions. Finally, this requires the strengthening of the confidence between States and the! buttressing of international! security politically and legally for instance, by concluding a world treaty on the non-use of force, which has been on the agenda for a long time.\n194.\tRegrettably, all pertinent negotiations are interrupted or stalled at present. That is no wonder, because he who calculates nuclear war as a means of his policy, he who undertakes the manufacture of the neutron bomb, he who intends to keep increasing his arsenals of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, will reject even partial agreements such as the complete prohibition of nuclear weapon tests. He who claims large parts of the world as his exclusive sphere of interest and acts accordingly, he who converts entire regions into military staging areas, he who seeks hegemony, obviously lacks the genuine will to strengthen regional and international security by establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones or zones of peace.\n195.\tDriving up military expenditure to unprecedented levels, as is done in this country, means obstructing international agreements on the reduction of arms budgets. That is the logic of things, and it is reflected in all disarmament negotiations.\n196.\tBy contrast, the proposals of the socialist countries say what needs to be done and what can be done at this moment. They are a solid bridge for understanding, an offer of goodwill and an indication of readiness to negotiate. Thus socialist foreign policy lives up to the supreme responsibility, that is, the responsibility for peace. Fresh and convincing proof of this is the Soviet proposal that has been expounded in this forum [see 7th meeting, para. 116] that the General Assembly should adopt a declaration solemnly proclaiming that States and statesmen who would be the first to use nuclear weapons would commit the gravest crime against humanity. The Soviet Union's proposal that the arms race not be extended to outer space [see AI361192, annex] also underscores that commitment to world peace. We view it as a new chance to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and to establish an international legal barrier to territorial arms proliferation. Therefore the General Assembly should at this session work with all its authority for such an agreement.\n197.\tThe German Democratic Republic considers that at its thirty-sixth session the General Assembly should moreover make every effort to ensure that the SALT process will be continued, safeguarding all the positive achievements made; that military doctrines apt to facilitate nuclear war will be outlawed; and that the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva will reach agreement on the cessation of all nuclear-weapon tests, the prohibition of chemical and radiological weapons and the strengthening of security guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States, thus providing a solid basis for the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\n198.\tWhat is necessary is to check the arms competition, to reduce the danger of war by establishing nuclear weapon-free peace zones, to halt the arms buildup in the world's oceans and to prevent the militarization of outer space.\n199.\tSteps against the danger of nuclear war in Europe are a matter of particular urgency. It is a historic accomplishment of the States of that continent that they have set in motion the process of detente, though what has been achieved is now seriously jeopardized. The planned deployment of the most modern United States medium range nuclear missiles which, it is proposed, are to be equipped with neutron warheads, is, whatever the pretext, calculated to acquire the capability to attack socialism in Europe, practically without any advance warning.\n200.\tHence the goal is to attain a so-called first-strike capability. The concept is to nourish the belief that a nuclear war is not all that terrible, that it can even be won. That is an illusion, but an extremely dangerous one because it imperils mankind's existence. For this reason, more and more people are opposing that arms mania. Across political and ideological boundaries, they share a deep sense of responsibility for the destiny of nations and a firm will to avert a nuclear holocaust. This movement has our full respect.\n201.\tThe deployment of new medium-range missiles would force the Warsaw Treaty States to take the necessary military countermeasures. To avoid that necessity and to avert a new boost in armaments, the arms drive must be halted and negotiations that will yield tangible results held without delay.\n202.\tIt would be good if things were seen as realistically everywhere and if constantly repeated declarations of intent to engage in a dialog were finally followed by deeds, as the socialist countries, as the Soviet Union, have demonstrated again and again. We welcome the joint Soviet UnionUnited States communique on the talks held on 23 September and expect tangible results.\n203.\tThe moratorium proposed by the USSR on the deployment of new medium-range nuclear missiles would facilitate such negotiations. Freezing the existing capability for an agreed period of time would not result in disadvantages for anybody; the climate for negotiations would be improved and the possibility of achieving tangible results increased.\n204.\tMy country's profound commitment to peace is self-evident. The German Democratic Republic now finds itself faced with immense stockpiles of all kinds of death dealing weapons, and the territory to the. west of my country's frontier already has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons in the world. There are plans to expand and modernize this capability and to increase the personnel and move them even closer to our western frontier. That this will not serve detente is obvious. Only with political goodwill on all sides is a dynamic continuation of the process of detente possible. For this reason the German Democratic Republic expects that the Madrid meeting will agree to convene a European conference on confidence building and disarmament.\n205.\tStable security in Europe includes a reasonable relationship between the two German States; peaceful coexistence alone can provide the basis for it. That is the purpose of the German Democratic Republic's policy.\n206.\tIdeas that are unrealistic and incompatible with international law, as have also been pronounced here from this rostrum, are not helpful to a good neighborly relationship. On the contrary, they are bound to encourage revanchist and right-wing extremists to disturb indeed, to poison the atmosphere. This is bound to put obstacles in the .way of the necessary normal relationship.\n207.\tA sense of realism in the conduct of policy has nowadays become essential for international security. In the national interest, that means above all respect for the legitimate concerns of other States, dependability, a responsible attitude in fulfilling accepted international obligations and correspondence between words and deeds.\n208.\tA realistic and calculable policy means, first and foremost, a policy serving mankind's fife and objectives, that is, a policy which promotes peace. He who wishes to work for peace in Europe must not erect walls of super armament against, the possibility of coexisting in peace based on sovereign equality and in prosperity. Further more, he must not contribute to the establishment of a staging ground for a devastating nuclear war. Such policies will not be welcomed by the peoples.\n209.\tThe improved political climate of the 1970s also visibly invigorated international economic exchanges. Is it not remarkable that in the last decade EastWest trade more or less quadrupled? Regionally and globally, common concerns were being addressed, the beginnings of solutions were emerging and new forms of mutually beneficial cooperation were proving their worth. But in this area, too, reactionary forces resorting to boycotts, embargoes, economic pressure and threats now intend to extend their confrontationist course into international relations. This impedes a democratic restructuring of international economic relations. No one who wants to exploit economic exchanges in the interest of power and a policy of strength can be interested in settling those problems on the basis of sovereign equality.\n210.\tThe German Democratic Republic's policy is to contribute to prosperous international economic cooperation. All States should base their actions on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [General Assembly resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n211.\tThe German Democratic Republic's position, based on principle, invariably implies support for the developing countries in their struggle for the new international economic order and against neocolonialism and foreign exploitation.\n212.\tWe have always promoted to the best of our ability the extension of detente to all regions of the globe, as the United Nations has urged. To that end we have also worked as a member of the Security Council. Certainly not all the conflicts were eliminated in the 1970s, but conditions for further progress became more favorable. The confrontationist course and the territorial spread of the arms race, however, jeopardize those achievements and encourage anew aggression, terrorism and subversion, which in the case of Israel and South Africa, with the support of certain other States, have been declared State policy.\n213.\tStrengthening the international authority of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] is therefore all the more important. The right of the people of Palestine to establish a State of its own is being increasingly recognized. A lasting Middle East peace settlement will be possible only if any action is based on the notion that no solution is possible without or against the PLO.\n214.\tIn southern Africa, the racist regime is increasing its efforts to make Namibia a neocolonial satellite State. While the group of five Western States has been showing understanding for South Africa's position, it seeks to force the South West Africa People's Organization [SMPO] to capitulate. There is an effort to invalidate Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\n215.\tThe German Democratic Republic declares its solidarity with the decisions on the question of Namibia adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity [fMl/1 at its meeting at Nairobi [see A/36/534, annex I]. It voted in favor of General Assembly resolution ES8/2 adopted at the eighth emergency special session, condemning the continued occupation of Namibia and calling for mandatory sanctions to be taken against South Africa. SWAPO can be sure of our continued firm support.\n216.\tAlso from this rostrum, the German Democratic Republic condemns the attack of the South African racist regime on sovereign Angola and demands the immediate cessation of all military aggression.\n217.\tThe arms race has now also reached the Indian Ocean. Concerned at this development, and because of the naval presence and feverishly reinforced systems of bases, the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean are striving to set up a zone of peace. The German Democratic Republic supports that effort and holds that the planned conference on that subject should be convened very soon. We have made proposals for its proceedings in the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, and we hope that they will be helpful in the matter.\n218.\tThe German Democratic Republic resolutely supports the demand for the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and is in favor of the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the country's reunification.\n219.\tThe peoples of the Middle East and of SouthEast Asia are making great efforts towards collective security in their regions. We are in accord with Afghanistan's proposals for the solution of the situation around that country, and sympathize with its struggle against the counterrevolutionary forces that are being steered and armed from outside. The willingness of that country's Government to have the United Nations participate in relevant negotiations is fresh evidence of a constructive accommodation in the interest of a political solution to the problem. Important proposals have come from the USSR for detente in the Gulf area.\n220.\tWe have great respect for the people of Kampuchea and its Government. The German Democratic Republic strongly rejects all designs of imperialist and hegemonist quarters to disturb peaceful\\\" reconstruction. The seat in the Organization belongs to the representatives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which has amply demonstrated its constructive policy by making far-reaching proposals to the States in the region.\n221.\tIt is necessary, we believe, to intensify the struggle against the mass violation of human rights by imperialism, colonialism and fascism. Moreover, the Organization should do everything in its competence to promote solutions to basic social problems.\n222.\tThe German Democratic Republic submitted at the previous session of the General Assembly a draft resolution against ideologies and practices of fascism and neo-fascism. I wish to take this opportunity to thank all the delegations that supported it.\n223.\tI trust that representatives will agree with me when I say today that meanwhile a great deal of new evidence of Fascist terror, in El Salvador and elsewhere, has come forth. The interrelation between that phenomenon and the described negative trends in international affairs is evident.\n224.\tThe German Democratic Republic therefore believes that it is essential to take appropriate measures in order to oppose with even greater determination the extremist proponents of war and hatred between nations.\n225.\tFinally, let me assure the Assembly that the German Democratic Republic is firmly resolved to contribute in a businesslike and constructive spirit to such results of this session of the General Assembly as will help promote world peace and preserve the detente process as the dominating trend in international life in the 1980s.\n"

The Bangladesh delegation also welcomes the admission of Vanuatu and Belize as new Members of the United Nations, thus adding to the strength of the United Nations and of the free world.\n146.\tMr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Bangladesh and also on my own behalf, I extend to you our wannest congratulations on your assumption of the high office of President of the Assembly. We fervently hope that your outstanding personal qualities and wide ranging experience will be of immense benefit to the Assembly in its deliberations.\n147.\tTo our esteemed friends who reposed their confidence in Bangladesh by voting for the Bangladesh candidate, we express our gratitude. However, we assure the new President of our full cooperation and support.\n148.\tI should also like to convey our deep appreciation to Mr. von Wechmar for his valuable contributions as\nPresident of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n149.\tI also wish to record our sincere appreciation to the SecretaryGeneral for his dedicated and untiring efforts in upholding the objectives and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the courage and perseverance with which he continued to work towards our shared goal of international peace and security.\n150.\tThis is the fifth occasion on which I have had the honor of addressing the Assembly as the leader of the Bangladesh delegation. But on this occasion I am performing my duty under the shadow of the tragic death of President Ziaur Rahman. I take this opportunity of expressing our gratitude to our friends who shared with us our grief and sorrow.\n151.\tWorld leaders paid many rich and well-deserved tributes to him, but the richest tribute came from his own people, to whose wellbeing the late President had dedicated himself. During this national calamity, the people of Bangladesh showed a rare sense of unity and determination in upholding the democratic principles and values in which the late President had an abiding faith and in carrying forward his unfinished task of raising the quality of life of the people of Bangladesh and serving the cause of international peace and security.\n152.\tThe representatives who had the opportunity of listening to his statement to the General Assembly at the eleventh special session in September 1980 [3rd meeting], will recall his objective and analytical exposition of the problems that bedevil the contemporary world. That statement was widely acclaimed for the courage, vision and statesmanship it reflected in underlining the interdependence of nations and the interrelatedness of their interests. In stressing the indivisibility of political and economic security, he made a stirring call for concerted action and united efforts on the part of all nations, North and South and East and West, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] and nonmembers of OPEC alike.\n153.\tThe purport of the message of our late President found reaffirmation in many of the illuminating statements by my colleagues who have preceded me during the current session of the General Assembly. As I listened to those admirable, comprehensive and insightful analyses of the dynamics of our changing world, I felt heartened to see an emerging consensus among the nations of the world, cutting across geographical, racial and ideological boundaries.\n154.\tInstead of being repetitive, I shall try briefly to highlight some of the major elements of that consensus which reflect the realities of the contemporary world and are of crucial importance to its future.\n155.\tSpeaker after speaker has rightly stressed that the United Nations can be only as strong and effective as its sovereign Member States would like it to be, that, despite the many constraints inherent in the present structure of the world political and economic order, its role in reducing tension and containing armed conflicts has been commendable and that without the United Nations our world, divided and polarized as it is, would have been much worse, and not better. Bangladesh fully endorses that view.\n156.\tBangladesh also shares the concern and anguish expressed over the deteriorating world political and economic situation. But, this is essentially the outcome of the lack of political will to respect the principles of the Charter, to which all Member States are solemnly committed For example, peace can be restored in the Middle East through implementation of the United Nations decisions requiring Israel to withdraw from all illegally occupied Arab territories and restoring to the Palestinians their inalienable national rights, including their right to a State of their own. In a similar manner, peace can be secured in Afghanistan and Kampuchea by the withdrawal of all foreign troops from those countries, leaving their peoples free to determine their own destiny without external intervention in any form.\n157.\tBangladesh also endorses the view that the framework for a just and peaceful solution of the problem of Namibia and for ending racism and apartheid in southern Africa is contained in the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. In like manner, Bangladesh believes that a just and honorable settlement of the Cyprus problem to the mutual satisfaction of both the communities involved can be found through talks between the leaders of the two communities initiated by the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations.\n158.\tThe views expressed on the role of the nonaligned movement as a positive force in promoting international peace by checking greatPower rivalry and safeguarding the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of nations showed a striking unanimity. Bangladesh firmly believes in strict adherence to the principles of nonalignment, which form the cornerstone of our foreign policy.\n159.\tBangladesh also subscribes to the view that peace and stability in various regions contribute to world peace and are an essential precondition for development. It has therefore been the consistent endeavor of Bangladesh to maintain and promote friendly relations with our neighbors. As a logical corollary to that foreign policy objective, Bangladesh is vigorously pursuing in cooperation with other countries in the SouthAsian region the proposal mooted by its late President for a SouthAsian forum for regional cooperation.\n160.\tBangladesh fully agrees that the world economic scene is indeed most disquieting, with the poor countries engaged in a grim struggle against hunger, disease and mass unemployment and the rich industrialized countries also battling, against inflation, recession and unemployment. Such political and economic problems are compounded by a decline in human and moral values.\n161.\tThose problems are, however not to be viewed as isolated phenomena. They fall into a pattern as interlinked parts of a larger and wider crisis, with its causes roofed in the present world order embracing the whole gamut of our inherited concepts, attitudes, values and institutions. The present world order tends to divide and polarize nations and breeds fear, distrust and power rivalry. It is a world that is in great disarray. The newly emergent nations find their position highly vulnerable, with declining respect for the rule of law and increasing use of armed might. Peace hangs tenuously on the so-called balance of power.\n162.\tThe concept of balance of power has, however, proved to be an anachronism. An inevitable byproduct of that concept is the alarming escalation of the arms race. The annual expenditure of over $500 billion is more than 10 times the amount that is now available as assistance to the developing countries. With an existing stockpile of deadly weapons capable of destroying our planet many times over, such a staggering expenditure on arms is totally irrational. The reality is that it has diminished, rather than increased, the sense of security of the great Powers and has bred more distrust and more fear. Such wasteful use of an enormous volume of the world's precious resources is also clearly immoral, when millions die of starvation and many more millions are struggling for their very survival. It has also unleashed a whole chain of frightening reactions: inflation, recession, unemployment and social and moral decline, posing a serious threat to the delicate balance of the life supporting system on our planet, the Earth.\n163.\tIt is more evident than ever before that the problems facing the contemporary world cannot be solved if we remain captives of concepts, attitudes and institutions of a bygone era. Nor can we expect them to be solved in isolation or through confrontation. Happily, there are clear signs of a new awakening of the world community to the need to adjust itself to the new realities. One of those new realities is the emergence of the new independent sovereign States and their aspiration to make their independence meaningful through' rapid economic and social development.\n164.\tAnother reality is that we are members of an interdependent international community transformed by advances in science and technology and that we need a concept of peace based on mutual trust, harmony and cooperation. We have the needed resources and technology to ensure a good life for all the members of the family of mankind.\n165.\tIt is also a reality that an enormous productivity potential still remains undeveloped. The paramount need of the hour is for a clearer perception of mutual needs and a more rational application and management of the world's resources in developing the productivity potential on a global basis, thus generating more productivity, more employment more income and wider markets, witH more goods and services to be shared by ail nations.\n166.\tThe world order, which allows the world to be perpetually divided into segments of rich and poor, with 800 million of its population in constant fear of starvation, is clearly irrational and preposterous. Through a global approach based on mutuality of interests and cooperative efforts, the world can be rid of the scourges of hunger, disease and illiteracy that plague two thirds of its population and of the inflation, recession and unemployment that bedevil the remaining third.\n167.\tWe firmly believe that political and economic security for the entire family of mankind is a goal that can be achieved through a concrete action program, as follows:\n168.\tFirst, all States Members of the United Nations, including the great Powers, must honor their commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n169.\tSecond, they must observe the rule of law in international relations, respect the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of all nations and renounce the use of force in the settlement of disputes.\n170.\tThird, they must implement their commitment to the goal of disarmament, with the great Powers themselves setting an example in checking nuclear proliferation and the production of new nuclear weapons and in gradually reducing the existing stock of such weapons.\n171.\tFourth, the nonaligned countries must strictly adhere to the principles of nonalignment and reactivate the movement as a moral force in resisting all forms of expansionism, colonialism, hegemonism and racism.\n172.\tFifth, the principles of creating zones of peace, for example in the Indian Ocean, South Asia, SouthEast Asia, the Pacific and Africa, must be followed.\n173.\tSixth, the International Development Strategy must be implemented through a more rational use and distribution of world resources and technology for full exploitation of the productivity potential on a global basis.\n174.\tSeventh, a food security system must be developed in order to ensure a supply of food from food-surplus regions to food-deficit regions and to ensure the flow of adequate inputs to countries with potential for rapid agricultural development.\n175.\tEighth, immediate and appropriate steps must be taken for the implementation of the Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, adopted at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held at Paris in September 1981.\n176.\tNinth, within the framework of economic cooperation among developing countries, surplus funds of OPEC should increasingly be invested in other developing countries, with priority assigned to the special needs of the least developed ones. In like manner, the more developed among the developing countries should also assist the development efforts of the less developed ones.\n177.\tTenth, in view of the energy crisis, an international consortium should be formed with assistance from both the industrial and the OPEC countries for exploration and development of energy in the developing countries.\n178.\tEleventh, recognizing the importance of the seabed resources of the developing countries, the development and codification of an international law governing the ocean regime should be expedited, in order to ensure a just and equitable sharing of those resources, including the sharing of international river waters.\n179.\tLastly, the democratic principle of equal and full participation of all countries in the formulation and implementation of decisions in all international forums should be followed.\n180.\tOn behalf of the delegation of Bangladesh I should like to conclude by a reaffirmation of our faith in the vision of a new future for the family of mankind, the vision which inspired the founding fathers of this body. In that vision is reflected the most important heritage of mankind, namely, man's undying spirit, which has blazed its trail through the ages, surmounting obstacles in the search for peace, freedom, justice, equality and human dignity, and opening up new frontiers of progress. We fervently hope that that spirit will inspire and unite the nations of the world in their efforts to move forward towards their common goal of a better future for all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, Mr. President, I want to offer my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The professional and personal qualities which you have so clearly demonstrated make you eminently qualified.\n205.\tSecondly, I wish to extend a most sincere welcome to the Republic of Vanuatu to our global family of nations.\n206.\tThe perspectives for the future are gloomy. More than ever we, the Members of the United Nations, are obliged to devote all our attention to finding peaceful solutions to the world's problems in strict accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n207.\tInternational tension is mounting and the arms race is accelerating despite efforts to the contrary. Fundamental principles of the Charter are still being violated by the Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan and by the presence of Vietnamese forces in Kampuchea. The continuing tension in the Middle East, which has recently been increasing, endangers peace not only in the region itself. South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and its oppressive system of apartheid pose an ever increasing threat to peaceful developments on the African continent. In El Salvador, the population is suffering from a brutal civil war with a Government offering no peaceful solution.\n208.\tThe worldwide economic recession has become a critical factor for us all. And even more so has the growing gap between rich and poor nations of the world. As was stated in the report of the Brandt Commission, this problem constitutes one of the most serious challenges to the international community in the years ahead. A solution of the NorthSouth problem is not only necessary for building a more equitable world economic order. It will play a key role in the maintenance of world peace as well.\n209.\tAnother most distressing factor is the increasing violation of fundamental human rights in many parts of the world.\n210.\tI have mentioned only a few factors contributing to the deterioration of the international situation. Another major disturbing factor is, of course, the growth of a climate of distrust between East and West. There is an urgent need to halt this trend and reestablish a comprehensive dialog. Only thus will it be possible to maintain and further the efforts towards detente, to which there is no reasonable or acceptable alternative.\n211.\tOne component of the ongoing EastWest dialog to which we attach particular importance is the follow-up to the Final Act of the Conference on Security, and Cooperation in Europe, signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975. We earnestly hope that it will prove possible to reach agreement in Madrid on a balanced and substantial concluding document, including progress on human aspects of detente and a concrete mandate for a European disarmament conference. A result along these lines would also contribute substantially to improving EastWest relations and the international situation as a whole.\n212.\tUnfortunately, the current international tensions have a marked negative impact on the disarmament efforts within and outside the framework of the United Nations. The continued worldwide arms race underlines the importance of pursuing the disarmament dialog, which would also foster a successful outcome of the second special General Assembly session on disarmament next year.\n213.\tLet us not forget the basic common interests shared by all nations. These transcend national and ideological frontiers which lie behind that dialog. Never before in the history of mankind would a broad armed conflict have such terrible effects as it would in the nuclear age. Life on this planet is at stake, and there will be no winners.\n214.\tThe paramount horrors inherent in the continued arms race are accompanied by the paradox that, in the face of global poverty and starvation afflicting billions of people, the amount spent on official development assistance is less than $25 billion, while global military expenditure is approaching $500 billion.\n215.\tThe arms race, nuclear as well as conventional, is heavily concentrated on a limited number of countries which account for the major part of the world's military arsenals. These countries carry a special responsibility for setting an international example and for contributing actively to the international disarmament endeavors.\n216.\tNuclear disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation remain issues of the highest priority. A further spread of nuclear weapons would have far-reaching repercussions on international security and stability. Consequently, no efforts should be spared to convince States which have not acceded to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons that there is no alternative to that Treaty. The acquisition of nuclear weapons by additional States would in no way improve their security perceptions. On the contrary, it would inevitably lower the threshold of nuclear war.\n217.\tThe only alternative to a further spread of nuclear weapons is a gradual lessening of the degree of dependence on nuclear weapons for national security purposes, leading to complete destruction of all existing stockpiles of such weapons. For this reason Denmark fully supports a continuation of the SALT process.\n218.\tWe warmly welcome the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to start substantive negotiations on long-range theater nuclear forces in Europe later this year. Negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty have now been going on for four years. It is time for the international community to press its justified demand for an early conclusion of such a treaty.\n219.\tSo far I have mentioned only nuclear weapons, but the efforts to halt the arms race must comprise all types of weapons, including conventional weapons, which account for more than 80 per cent of total world military expenditure.\n220.\tDenmark has argued for many years that more attention should be given to the conventional arms race. Pursuit to a Danish initiative, the General Assembly last year adopted resolution 35/156 A, approving in principle the carrying out of a study by the SecretaryGeneral, with the assistance of a group of experts appointed by him, on all aspects of conventional weapons and agreeing that the Disarmament Commission should work out the general approach, scope and structure of the study at its third substantive session earlier this year. The Commission had an inconclusive but fruitful discussion on this issue. We are convinced that based on the discussions in the Commission the General Assembly will be able this year to pursue the question.\n221.\tRecent developments in the Middle East once more make it clear that the vicious circle of violence in the region must be broken. The confrontation between Israel and Arab countries carries serious implications for the stability and vulnerability of the entire region. The continuation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq adds to the tension. The unresolved problems in Lebanon complicate the situation even further, as mentioned by many before me.\n222.\tThe Danish Government welcomed the agreements reached at Camp David by Egypt, Israel and the United States and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel as important steps towards a comprehensive solution of the Middle East conflict. Much to our regret we have still not seen any broadening of the peace process towards a comprehensive settlement.\n223.\tA comprehensive peace settlement is a must. It is a fundamental conviction of my Government that peace can only be negotiated. A negotiated peace must build upon the right to existence and to security of all the States in the region, including Israel, and justice for all the peoples, which implies recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n224.\tThese are the basic principles of the Venice Declaration of the member States of the European Community,5 and the wish of the Community to act as a catalyst is proving its worth.\n225.\tOnce more we are witnessing a further deterioration of the situation in southern Africa. The policies pursued by the South African Government augment and prolong human suffering and oppression. In Namibia, the South African illegal occupation continues in defiance of the United Nations resolutions and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. South Africa has intensified and widened its armed incursions into neighboring States, most recently Angola. Denmark, like most members of the world community, strongly condemns these South African attacks.\n226.\tThe breakdown of the Geneva meeting in January 1981 demonstrated anew South African intransigence and delayed further the implementation of the Security Council resolutions on Namibia. The urgency of bringing pressure to bear on South Africa on this issue should be evident to everyone.\n227.\tI should like to reaffirm my Government's firm support for urgent implementation of the United Nations plan endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978). It would not be understood if all the five members of the Western contact group did not do their utmost now to act in accordance with the spirit behind the decisions of the United Nations. Denmark stands ready to contribute to the implementation of the plan and to the development of an independent Namibia.\n228.\tIn South Africa itself the apartheid system is being consolidated. No meaningful changes are in sight. The oppression of the majority of the population has assumed new and horrible forms. Banning and detention without charge or trial is but one example. The tragic incident in August of this year in the Nyanga township was an especially brutal manifestation of the apartheid policy. I cannot but express once more my Government's strong condemnation of the apartheid system. There is only one conclusion to draw: the international pressure on South Africa must be intensified and made more effective. Meanwhile, Denmark intends to continue and increase its humanitarian and educational assistance to the victims of oppression in southern Africa.\n229.\tThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 and the continued Soviet military presence in that country remain a constant source of destabilization in the region and an obstacle to the improvement of international relations. More than 10 per cent of the Afghan population has been forced to flee the country. This has placed a heavy burden on the neighboring States, not to mention the sufferings of those who have remained in Afghanistan.\n230.\tIn spite of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and a number of other sincere initiatives aimed at a political solution to the crisis, the Soviet Union has chosen to ignore world opinion and to maintain its military presence in formerly nonaligned and independent Afghanistan. A solution must be found in which Afghanistan's independence; and nonaligned status can be assured. There simply is no alternative to pursuing an internationally acceptable negotiated settlement of the Afghan crisis as proposed by the member States of the European Community.\n231.\tThe armed Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea almost three years ago and the continued presence in that country of a large contingent of Vietnamese forces is a depressing example of persistent disregard of basic international principles. Denmark, like the great majority of the States Members of the United Nations, deeply deplores the fact that the Kampuchean people remains deprived of its right to determine its own future without outside interference.\n232.\tDenmark fully supports the process initiated by the recent International Conference on Kampuchea and can only regret that Viet Nam, as one of the contending parties, did not take .part. We urge Viet Nam to change its position and thus contribute constructively to an early negotiated solution of the Kampuchean problem. We should also like to see the Soviet Union take an active part in such negotiations.\n233.\tThe situation of many developing countries, and especially the poorest among them, is even more desperate than it was a year ago. This must be of great concern to us, both as individual nations and as members of an organization like the United Nations whose aim is the promotion of international cooperation. The economic problems often of a basic nature which affect the whole world today have severe consequences. We would all benefit from the achievement of solutions to them. Rirthermore, we are convinced that balanced and sustained results can be accomplished only if the nations of the world cooperate in attaining such solutions.\n234.\tAgainst this background the lack of progress in the NorthSouth dialog over the past year is a serious disappointment to my Government and, understandably, even more so to the developing countries. The Danish Government firmly believes that open, frank and constructive cooperation among all nations is a prerequisite for achieving longterm economic and social prosperity as well as political stability. The present situation, which is close to a stalemate, should not be permitted to continue.\n235.\tAt this session of the General Assembly we can demonstrate our preparedness to move forward by reaching agreement on launching global negotiations. Denmark remains committed to the concept of a new round of global negotiations and believes that global negotiations as defined in General Assembly resolution 34/138 represent the right way to tackle the problems of the world economy and especially the problems faced by developing countries.\n236.\tThe procedure and agenda for the global negotiations have already been discussed for too long, and we all know what the remaining issues are. We hope that all States are prepared to make renewed efforts to achieve agreement on the remaining issues, thus allowing substantive negotiations to be started as soon as possible.\n237.\tMany of us are looking forward to the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development in Mexico next month. Let us send the following, message to the 22 participating heads of State: \\\"You have now a decisive responsibility. The world will be disappointed in you if not all of you show the necessary will to live up to the intentions of the Brandt Commission's report.\\\" And to the rich countries in particular, it must be said: \\\"Words alone are not enough. There is an urgent need now for real solutions where we\u2014the rich countries\u2014must demonstrate our willingness to sacrifice.\\\"\n238.\tIn August, the United Nations convened at Nairobi the Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. The Conference succeeded in reaching agreement on a comprehensive Program of Action containing a wide range of recommendations on concerted efforts ;o promote the development and utilization of new and renewable sources of energy. In our view, the outcome of the Conference was satisfactory. The United Nations demonstrated for the first time its capacity for a constructive discussion on energy matters in a broad perspective within the NorthSouth dialog.\n239.\tAnother equally important event was the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which closed in Paris on the eve of the opening of this session of the General Assembly. On the whole), my delegation regards that Conference as a very successful one that achieved what could reasonably be expected. In particular, it demonstrated the broad solidarity of the international community including developing countries outside the group of least developed countries with the tragic plight of those countries. It was, however, a disappointment but not a surprise that the Socialist countries once again did not join the rest of the international community in that expression of solidarity.\n240.\tNaturally, Denmark would have preferred a much stronger commitment in the parts of the Substantial New Program of Action4 dealing with the transfer of official development assistance. We are, however, satisfied that all donor countries reaffirmed the 0.7 per cent target as adopted in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [General Assembly resolution 35/56, annex]. We are also pleased to note that a substantial number of donor countries announced their firm intention to increase rapidly their assistance to the least developed countries in the context of their endeavors to reach that target.\n241.\tDenmark already devotes some 0.25 per cent of its gross national product to official development assistance to the least developed countries. We welcome the mention of the 0.15 per cent subtarget for such assistance along with the call in the Program of Action for efforts to double the assistance to those countries by 1985.\n242.\tIn the view of the Danish Government, one of the most important effects of the Conference was to draw the attention of the entire international community to the enormous problems of the least developed countries/The creation of a comprehensive framework for dealing with those problems at the national and international levels during the remaining years of the decade will sustain international attention and facilitate a solution of the problems. I pledge the full support of the Government of my country for the implementation and the follow-up of the Substantial New Program of Action.\n243.\tOne of the major tasks of the United Nations is to promote universal respect for and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. Under the Charter all Member States have pledged to cooperate with the United Nations in the attainment of that goal. Nevertheless, it is a tragic circumstance that violations of basic human rights are taking place on a growing scale around the world. At this very moment human beings are suffering from inhuman and cruel treatment because of their convictions.\n244.\tI think it is an alarming fact that torture has become a part of daily life in an increasing number of countries. Who should make an outcry against this if not the United Nations?\n245.\tThat is the starting point of the Nordic initiative in the Commission on Human Rights aimed at establishing a United Nations voluntary fund for victims of torture. In practice, such a fund would work on the basis of voluntary contributions for distribution through established channels of humanitarian assistance as humanitarian, legal and financial aid to victims of torture and to relatives of such victims.\n246.\tThe Nordic proposal has been endorsed by the Commission on Human Rights and subsequently by the Economic and Social Council, and we hope that this idea will be finally approved at the present session of the General Assembly, with the broadest possible support.17 Such a decision would also be a symbol of the general commitment of the United Nations to the cause of human rights.\n247.\tSubject to parliamentary approval, my Government intends to earmark a relatively substantial contribution 1 million Danish kroner to the proposed fund in the hope that other countries will feel able to make comparable contributions.\n248.\tThe tenor of my statement this year has not been optimistic. Optimism is not justified at this juncture. There are too many indications that the world is moving towards confrontation and crisis and away from reconciliation, international cooperation and peaceful settlement of disputes.\n249.\tThe world community must not, however, give up or despair at this unfortunate trend. The United Nations was founded in order to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems. The SecretaryGeneral has time and again emphasized the role that the Organization could play if given more opportunity. We, the Member States, have the means to do so. But we must demonstrate the necessary will and get rid of selfishness. Let us demonstrate the needed sense of universal solidarity and thereby devote ourselves to the noble principles of this great Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "95.\t Before I begin my statement, I wish to make reference to the news this morning of the attempt to assassinate President Sadat. I wish to convey our regret to the Government of Egypt, with our hope for his speedy recovery. It is unfortunate that the world should again be traumatized by such an act of violence against a man perceived as a man of peace.\n96.\tSir, it is a pleasure for me on behalf of the Bahamian delegation to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. You assume office with high qualifications for the post, and with the acquired experience and stature which you possess you are especially well equipped to guide the affairs of this troubled session. I wish you success in that demanding office and pledge the support of my delegation to you and your colleagues in the General Committee, and I add to that wish our hopes for a realistically productive thirty-sixth session.\n97.\tI also wish to pay a tribute to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Rudiger Von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, who presided over the thirty-fifth session, which at times appeared unending. We are indebted to him for the tact and skill, the patience and tolerance with which he carried out the functions of his office.\n98.\tI wish to take this opportunity to express the profound appreciation of my delegation and of the Government of the Bahamas for the unceasing efforts which the SecretaryGeneral has exerted in the pursuit of the goals and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations over the past years. Within the limits imposed upon him by institutional restraints as well as by an absence of either will or desire on the part of some States to reach the consensus which I believe the peoples of the world want in the pursuit of peace, economic security, self-determination and racial dignity for all people, he has preserved the integrity of his office and the credibility of the Organization.\n99.\tIt is a pleasant duty to welcome the new Member States of Vanuatu and Belize. Their admission is further evidence of the universality which the Organization is approaching, albeit at a \\\"glacial\\\" pace although that goal is resisted, sometimes fiercely, by a powerful minority that would still deny men freedom. In the case of Belize, particular pleasure is experienced by us in the Bahamas because of the small part which we were able to play in the final stages of its attainment of independence. It is to be expected that it will not be long before the lingering shadow cast over the universal acceptance of Belize by the international community, with one exception, will be dispelled by that one* which, though bigger and more powerful, was itself once an object of colonialism, a colonialism long since removed.\n100.\tI wish to recall the following words spoken at the twenty-eighth session, on the occasion of the admission of the Bahamas to membership of the United Nations, by the Prime Minister of the Bahamas then and now, the honorable Lynden O. Pindling:\n\\\"We believe that we can make a contribution to a better international understanding by sharing our experiences in human relations, in effecting change without disorder and revolution without bloodshed, and in developing a stable economic and social order. We of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas are aware that it is indeed unrealistic to think that nationStates can exist in isolation. No man is an island unto himself, nor is any nation. There is need for perpetual interdependence of the big and the small which will guarantee the perpetuation of the United Nations as the center for the harmonization of the actions of nations concerned with international peace and security, equality and freedom, economic and social justice, for all peoples.\n\\\"While man is reaching dramatically into the infinite limits of outer space and the fascinating confines of ocean depths, he is also prosaically reaching into his own mind to reassess .his global value system, which has yet to acknowledge that a world dominated by power politics and calculated alignments of self-interest and fear is less important than a world morality as expressed in the Charter of the United Nations. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas subscribes to the concept of alignments of States having in common respect for human and spiritual values rooted in belief in the absolutely indivisible freedom of the mind of man.\\\" [2119th meeting, paras. 179 and 180.]\n101.\tThose sentiments, expressed eight years ago, en capsuled then and continue to encapsulate the morality by which we in the Bahamas believe the international community ought to be guided.\n102.\tIt is not inaccurate to suggest that there are some few States which would prefer that the United Nations did not exist at all and there are some which do not care whether it exists or not those to. which it would not matter whether it existed or not. All of those collectively are fortunately in a minority, but unfortunately they constitute a minority which includes those who are rich and those who are powerful and those who are both rich and powerful.\n103.\tIt would riot be accurate to suggest that the United Nations has failed to satisfy the objectives of its Charter, neither would it be accurate to suggest that it has succeeded. But in the scales of assessment, we must weigh the fact that the Organization has provided a forum which has helped to avert a major world conflict for over 30 years; moreover, the major positive feature of world affairs must be recognized to be the continuing functional cooperation of the organizations of the United Nations system with its Member States in the pursuit of practical solutions of social, educational and economic problems with the aim of improving the qualify of life for all the world's people. But it also needs to be said that, in our experience, it is evident that a disproportionate part of the total assistance provided is allocated to administrative costs which help to maintain the enormous administrative establishment of the United Nations, with too little being allocated to technical assistance in each recipient country.\n104.\tIt is also a very unfortunate reflection on some Member States that some of those that are best able to carry a less disproportionate share of the cost of technical assistance persist in deferring their obligations to bear the level which they ought to be bearing. The level of such contributions needs to be increased in direct relationship to the legitimate demands being made for technical assistance and economic development, without which there will be no stability in the world. Yet those who ought to be in the forefront of the battle, leading the way, invite us to stand still and to be patient, thereby encouraging the political forces of extremism of both the political right and left.\n105.\tHowever, the scales of assessment must ?Jso take into account the fact that the agenda of the present session faithfully reflects political and ideological conflicts that have characterized the United Nations for over 30 years, the intransigence of Members, and the failure collectively to recognize that all the people of the world are not yet free.\n106.\tIt is a geopolitical fact which is recognized in few places apart from the Bahamas that we occupy a peculiar geographical position in the world in which our closest neighbor to the south is the Republic of Cuba and our closest neighbor to the north is the United States of America.\n107.\tNo country in the world prizes its freedom, independence, sovereignty and parliamentary democracy more fiercely than the Bahamas. The legacies of the former colonial slave societies which also evolved as multiracial societies have implicit in their existence some fundamental cultural contradictions and problems which have yet to be eradicated. The Bahamas is not unique in this; neither is it peculiar to us that the most urgent post-colonial task of our society is its economic and social reconstruction and development. It is therefore to be expected that our priorities must of necessity be somewhat different from the priorities of those countries whose colonial histories are different and more remote or countries that never really had any.\n108.\tIdeological conflicts which to some seem vital, tG us take on less awesome significance as the difficulties to be overcome in the course of economic and social development are further impeded by ideological conflicts, which do the greatest damage to the preservation of sovereign independence in our region.\n109.\tUnless there is agreement by all relevant States to accept the ideological plurality of the Caribbean region, including both its island and mainland States, our region will be plagued by friction, potential military conflicts and the constant threat of political instability.\n110.\tWe are rightly proud of the level of liberty and freedom enjoyed by the peoples of the Bahamas, but we are not unmindful of the fact that that level of sovereignty is still denied large numbers of persons in the world. Yet everywhere there is today some movement, sometimes overt and sometimes less open, where people are attempting to secure a larger measure of political freedom and more real control over their own affairs. No superPower, armed might or economic authority can defer indefinitely the peoples' movements, which we support everywhere, in which, man claims freedom from minority rule and economic oppression. These movements may take the form of peaceful revolution, such as we were able to achieve in the Bahamas; others may be less fortunate and may choose a separate route. But so long as the ultimate objective is greater freedom through giving the people the unfettered right to choose their own form of government, who could find fault with that?\n111.\tOne of the cultural and social phenomena of some States of our region is that their unique history has produced some special ethnic mixtures. It is an embarrassment to some and an affront to others that it is still true that, while the descendants of the sons of Africa in our part of the world are always among those for whom the greatest measure of social and political freedom and justice needs to be attained, they continue to be denied them because of the social and ethnic intransigence of both the ideological right and left.\n112.\tIt is not trite to inquire here who speaks with a powerful, clear and credible voice for human rights today. The old order of the world of the ideological right and left has failed to provide either leadership or hope for mankind. SuperPowers feed us unrelentingly with a morality of physical confrontation, and our hope for peace and tranquility is balanced on the scales of nuclear parity and deterrence. I do not believe that mankind is ennobled or that the people of the world are impressed or their lives enriched by the magnificent means of world destruction which are being accumulated, but I do believe that all people are dismayed, frustrated and frightened by them. Those who value power over principle and; political ideology over ideas and reason occupy the seats of the controllers of our destiny. Freedom and democracy are on the defensive.\n113.\tThose who have the voices, the power and the riches to mobilize those forces which do exist and which are in pursuit of democracy, political freedom, territorial integrity and economic and racial justice are silenced completely or subdued.\n114.\tThe recognizable power centers of the world are locked in the bondage of power politics as they are held hostage by their histories and cultures, which time is passing by.\n115.\tIs it too much to hope that during this thirty-sixth session of the Assembly of the nations of the world some tangible signs will be evidenced that will touch the conscience of mankind, inspire in the mighty some vision, reason and courage to promote and encourage and indeed lead those who cry out for mote freedom, more democracy, more regard for human rights and more economic and racial justice?\n116.\tIn the view of the Government of the Bahamas, the most intractable and urgent issues which have to be approached during the 'Jiirtysixth session of the General Assembly include decolonization; disarmament; persistent international conflicts, especially in the Middle East, Kampuchea and Cyprus; development and the need for international cooperation without discrimination in the related fields of human rights, economic and social development, energy and the environment, the law of the sea, drag control and refugees. Indeed, for the Bahamas, drug trafficking, economic refugees and the threat of economic discrimination are of crucial importance as they represent at this time immediate obstacles to our continued development.\n117.\tHow much longer will South Africa be allowed to violate the dignity of the Namibian people and the directives of the United Nations, which embody, inter alia, some of the most sacred principles of the Charter? South Africa not only continues to practice with virtual impunity a colonialist policy over the people of Namibia but is prepared with similar impunity to pursue a militaristic aggression adding a new dimension to the problem. The Bahamas further condemns, once again, the apartheid policy of the Government of South Africa. The Bahamas also wholeheartedly supports military, economic and cultural sanctions against South Africa. The Government of the Bahamas further reiterates its support for the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) as the basis for democratic rule and independence for Namibia.\n118.\tNothing in modern world history has affronted the dignity of so many people in the world as the racial policies of the Government of South Africa. The overwhelming majority of the people of the world are at war with the soul of South Africa as it is at present governed. Outside the African continent, there is a perception that in South Africa a white racist minority discriminates against and oppresses a black South African majority. That part of the picture is, to be sure, true, but it is incomplete in so far as it is a perception which does not recognize that apartheid goes beyond discrimination and oppression. For the Government of South Africa, locked as it is in the cocoon of its perversity, apartheid is a religion, the soul of their nation which gives it strength, the psychology of its people which gives them courage and a culture which gives meaning to their existence. We ought also not to underestimate the extent to which the Government of South Africa and the philosophy which it promotes represents an acceptable symbol to powerful ethnic forces in the world that cling to the belief that some men are more equal than others.\n119.\tNothing which I say ought to be interpreted in such a way as to weaken our resolve to persist until this unique evil is destroyed, but the philosophy of apartheid and its fellow-travelers will not be destroyed unless we are collectively prepared Jo revise some of our tactics in order to achieve our objectives. Most important of all, we have to destroy the illusion which it is seeking to create that South Africa is governed by normal people capable of conventional reason and intelligence and that in the fullness of time their own enlightened self-interest will force chaise upon them, for it will never happen that way. We ought never to indulge in the self-delusion that there are conventional means by which apartheid will be renounced and abandoned voluntarily by South Africa because that regime will ultimately come to the conclusion that that is the right thing to do.\n120.\tThis South African Government's religion and philosophy can only survive, too, because it has so many friends outside South Africa to give it aid and comfort. The war against apartheid must therefore be intensified outside South Africa against people who are capable of reason and intelligence and who ought to know what enlightened self-interest is.\n121.\tAs the Assembly is aware, the question of disarmament has been before the United Nations since its first session. While it would be unfair to say that no progress at all has been made towards reduction in arms buildup, both nuclear and conventional, it is clearly evident that this world body and its constituent Member States have a long way to go before the theory that a world without arms is a world without war can even be a credible proposition.\n122.\tHowever, because of the circumstances in which we find ourselves today, the current Disarmament Decade is, in the final analysis, an expression of hope, a new opportunity which we ought not to miss. It is in this spirit that the Bahamas looks forward to the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. For the hopes underlying the Disarmament Decade to become realities, it is imperative that the second special session devoted to disarmament build on the solid foundation of the Program of Action contained in the keystone Final Document of the first special session devoted to disarmament [resolution S10/2]. The second special session must also fashion a structure for armament control and peace which faithfully reflects the important and laboriously obtained compromises and solutions affecting disarmament arrived at in the resolutions of the First Committee between States of varying stages of development, with or without nuclear capacity.\n123.\tUnfortunately, man's perception of himself and his surroundings has not changed much in the years since his principal weapon of destruction was a bow and arrow. Those superPowers and others who take such pride in their nuclear weapons and other means of national destruction have absolutely no idea how the rest of us feel about them. It would be a lot less frightening if it were possible for them to use their magnificent weapons on one another and if their wars affected no one else but unhappily this is not to be. Sovereign as such Powers are, it is a vain hope to expect that what they perceive to be their needs will be unduly influenced by what the rest of the nations of the world perceive their own needs to be.\n124.\tOur age is at present consumed in a contest between the major Powers and their allies for the allegiance of the world, either through friendship or through feat At the core of the contest are the competing ideologies of the major Powers, which they see as representing the sources of their cultures and civilizations. Grossly oversimplified, this is no more than a perception of the need for self preservation. That which sovereign nations conceive to be their needs, in the interest of their national security, will continue to constitute a serious obstacle to disarmament. This does not mean that the goal of disarmament is impossible to attain, but rather that a fuller realization is needed that armaments are the effects of other perceptions which may in the end not be too difficult to overcome.\n125.\tThe situation in the Middle East is another part of our collective efforts towards international peace and security, which has taxed the energies of the Organization since its inception. The right Jo self-determination of the Palestinian people and of Israel remains the major issue of this complex conflict. A peaceful settlement in which the United Nations is a principal actor is therefore all the more urgent. Following from this basic premise, the position of the Government of the Bahamas, as has already been stated before this Assembly, consists of the following points: the acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable; Israel must end the occupation of territories it has held since the 1967 war; the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of each State in the region must be respected, as well as the right of the citizens of each State in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; and the establishment of a just and durable peace must take account of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians.\n126.\tThe situation in Kampuchea represents a further test of the will of the Organization to uphold the principles, enshrined in the Charter, of sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence, non-use of force and nonintervention. The Government of the Bahamas again condemns the violation of these principles in Kampuchea and further reiterates its call for the implementation by all Member States, particularly the principal parties to the conflict in Kampuchea, of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and endorses the establishment and aims of the Ad Hoc Committee called for by the recently concluded International Conference on Kampuchea.3\n127.\tCyprus is another area of tension which the Organization has an obligation to defuse. In this context, my delegation concurs with the statement and even warning of the SecretaryGeneral when he observed in his report on the work of the Organization with respect to the situation in Cyprus that \\\"continued delay [towards an agreed solution] . . . only serves to consolidate the status quo, which both parties have found to be unsatisfactory\\\" [see AI36I1, sect. IV]. My delegation therefore exhorts the parties concerned to intensify their negotiations via the inter-communal talks. It also calls for full respect for and implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations on this question, particularly those provisions which affirm the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Cyprus, demand the withdrawal of foreign troops and urge the voluntary return of refugees to their homeland in safety.\n128.\tThere has never before been a greater need to find the means to reconcile the perceived needs of sovereign nations and the known needs for greater international cooperation in economic development. But there has never been a time for greater cooperation, not confrontation, in finding the means to such a reconciliation. There are powerful voices in the world which would, perhaps without understanding, lead us to confrontation. The Bahamas firmly supports the launching as soon as possible of the global negotiations relating to international economic cooperation for development on the basis of the consensus to be found in resolution 34/138, in which the General Assembly emphasized \\\"the imperative need to establish a new system of international economic relations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and also to promote the common interest of all countries\\\".\n129.\tThere is an obvious relationship between political independence and economic independence, and there is an equally obvious relationship between political independence and the global ideological conflict in which, willingly or not, we are caught up. So it must follow that a failure to reach agreement on the means by which economic independence will be achieved is bound to influence political and ideological considerations. Hence it requires that those of us who wish to preserve our freedom and our political independence persist by means of the reconciliation of legitimately conflicting points of view among developed and developing countries.\n130.\tFreedom and political independence are rich harvests to reap, but they become a poor feast at the table of economic dependence. The economic philosophy of development which dictates that the rich should get richer and let riches trickle down to the poor is an affront to national dignity and sovereign independence. It is a philosophy of dependence worse than colonialism. The evolution of a more equitable system of economic relations among nations must not be deferred by those who fail to realize that total interdependence of the world requires, paradoxically, that the road of self-sufficiency and economic independence is called cooperation.\n131.\tI wish to state that my Government has been encouraged by the progress made at the last session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, particularly by the adoption of a program of work which envisages the completion of the work of the Conference next spring, and by the choice of Jamaica and the Federal Republic of Germany as the seats of the future International SeaBed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, respectively. The Bahamas regards the compromise text submitted by the President of the Conference on the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts as a major step towards the settlement of the complex issue of delimitation.\n132.\tThe problem of drug control and, in the case of the Bahamas, that of trafficking in drugs are among the primary social problems facing the Bahamas today. The geography of the Bahamas itself and its geographical location are contributory factors in the incidence of the traffic in drugs through our archipelago. The Bahamas covers an area of almost 100,000 nautical square miles of water with many isolated islands where ships and aircraft engaged in drug trafficking may seek haven to elude detection. The geographical location of the Bahamas also makes it a convenient transit country for illegal drugs destined for the big and profitable markets in North America.\n133.\tThe Bahamas is not now and has never been a producer of drugs and is not, in the international context, a major consumer, but consumption in the Bahamas has increased in direct relation to the volume of traffic passing through. Producer countries are generally south of the Bahamas; a major consumer country is to the north. This puts us in an unenviable position. Drug trafficking through the Bahamas is straining the economic, moral and social fabric of the islands of our Commonwealth. What is important to the Bahamas is the effect the traffic in drugs is having on small Bahamian communities where a high percentage of the adult male population may find it economically advantageous to become involved in this illicit business. This is a moral and cultural threat the long term ramifications of which could be devastating to us.\n134.\tThe major participants in this trade are not Bahamian nationals. They are almost all nationals of producer and consumer States. It can therefore be readily understood why the primary concern of the Bahamas in this matter is for greater involvement of the United Nations system to internationalize the approaches to these problems of trafficking so that those who contribute the most to the traffic, that is, producer and consumer countries, should be required to bear a greater share of the burden of law enforcement and eradication.\n135.\tThe resources of the Bahamas, a developing country, are not unlimited. Narcotics control should not have to be in competition v <h social services for funding from the national budget. What is urgently needed is adequate international cooperation among all States: the producer States, the consumer States and transit States such as the Bahamas. To this end, my Government supports the inclusion in the agenda of the Assembly at this session of the new item entitled \\\"International campaign against traffic in drags\\\" [item 129].\n136.\tThe Bahamas wishes to see the problem of international drug control in all its aspects given priority in the United Nations system. As a new member of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, my Government pledges itself to do its utmost to work for the speedy implementation of the suggested international measures which have been discussed and recommended in this and other bodies.\n137.\tSuccessive Governments of the Bahamas over almost 30 years, before and since its independence, have had to contend with the social and economic problems associated with the continuing movement of economic refugees. We are not unmindful of the problems of refugees and displaced persons in other parts of the world perhaps m even more distressing circumstances. But after having had to deal alone with this problem for such a length of time, It is not inappropriate for us to draw attention to the urgent need for the United Nations system to reappraise the criteria now used to define refugees and to determine eligibility for emergency assistance for refugees. Some nations have the capacity to absorb large numbers of immigrants, whether as refugees or as illegal immigrants, and among big nations some are more generous than others. But it is evident that, even among the physically big and exceptionally endowed nations with skill and re. sources in abundance, some remedies must be found and\nsome limits placed upon the influx of refugees.\n138.\tIn Latin America and the Caribbean, the problem has assumed and will continue to assume proportions which place enormous burdens on developing countries attempting to improve the quality of life for their people.\n139.\tWe in the Bahamas have had more than our tolerable share of economic refugees, who have come to our shores in flight from despair and desperately dehumanizing economic circumstances. The record will show that over almost 30 years we have provided a safe haven for numbers greater than our small country ought to have been required to accept, but we have done so with tolerance. Nevertheless, the problem remains and persists, and with varying degrees of intensity it will continue to impinge upon the development of countries in the area. Those countries from which such persons are refugees are in the unhappy position of not being able to keep pace with their own needs, which requires a separate international effort, but I am concerned here with drawing international attention to the urgent need to reexamine the role which the United Nations ought properly to play in the relief of the human tragedies which plague these people.\n140.\tThe tourist trade is the virtual lifeblood of the small country which I have the honor to represent here. Indeed, we have been the pioneers in travel and tourism in our part of the world? and such progress as we have made in the economic development of the Bahamas can be attributed for the most part to the success which we have achieved in an industry which was begun in the Bahamas in the last century.\n141.\tThat industry has served to create in the Bahamas a positive awareness of the need for better human relations between people of different nationalities. We have a reputation for tolerance and the acceptance of foreign nationals and foreign cultures in the Bahamas. We know that contact and communication at the level of the individual human being does more to build a world of understanding than political or diplomatic speeches, or even resolutions of the United Nations. We have come to regard tourism as a bridge for understanding between people. It is also the principle source of our national income. The example which we have set has been an inspiration to the States of the Caribbean region, which have taken heed of the success we have made of the travel and tourist industry as it has become, at the same time, an international industry of the twentieth-century world.\n142.\tFreedom of travel in a nondiscriminatory fashion has therefore not only made us a leader in the industry, aided the economic and social development of our people and made us a community of many nationalities but also created in us an international consciousness and made us a promoter of one world. The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations enjoins, us \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors\\\". How better to live as good neighbors than to know one another; how better to know one another than to meet one another; how better to meet one another than to travel?\n143.\tWe have therefore to reject as inconsistent with the purposes for which the United Nations was founded any attempts which have the effect of restricting peoples' freedom to engage in lawful travel and any measures which have the effect of discriminating between one tourist destination and another.\n144.\tThe Bahamas therefore hopes that the United Nations system will give high priority to the promotion of the travel and tourist industry as the most effective means of developing better understanding among people and at the same time giving greater stimulation to international trade and economic development.\n145.\tI am aware of the hymnal direction to \\\"beware of easy speeches\\\", so during the course of this session the Bahamian delegation will seek to put to the relevant committees of the Organization, where appropriate and possible, those ideas for practical implementation which may contribute to the production of realistic solutions to our many problems.\n146.\tMy delegation wishes to reaffirm its full support for the United Nations system, which for us represents the only international hope for the honorable resolution of the problems of mankind, which, after all, are not of the making of the majority of States represented here.\n147.\tIn conclusion, I would refer to some words spoken at the eighteenth session by a former representative of our host country to the United Nations upon the death of his President, in November 1963, which I respectfully commend to the Assembly:\n\\\"We shall not soon forget that he held fast to a vision of a world in which the peace is secure; in which inevitable conflicts are reconciled by pacific means; in which nations devote their energies to the welfare of all their citizens; and in which the vast and colorful diversity of human society can flourish in a restless, competitive search for a better society.\n\\\"We shall not soon forget that by word and by deed he gave proof of profound confidence in the present value and the future promise of this great Organization, the United Nations.\\\" [1264th meeting, paras. 193 and 194.]\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me to express to you, on behalf of the delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea, our warm congratulations on your brilliant election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n86.\tWe are convinced that, thanks to your great talents as an experienced diplomat and your knowledge of International affairs, the interests of the world community will prevail In the search for just solutions to the problems confronting us. Please be assured of the complete cooperation of the Guinean delegation.\n87.\tWe should like also to express our sincere gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. RUdlger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, who, with dedication and competence, so effectively conducted the proceedings of the thirty-fifth session,\n88.\tWe are pleased to welcome Vanuatu and Belize to the United Nations; their admission proves once again the inevitability of the triumph of the ideals of freedom, peace and progress and also universality of the Organization.\n89.\tPermit me also to express to the Secretary-General the full confidence of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea, and particulary that of President Ahmed Sekou Tour\u00e9, in the effective efforts he Is constantly pursuing for the realization of the principles and objectives of the Organization.\n90.\tToday, even more than in the past, the international community is faced with grave crises which remain a source of deep concern. How can peace be safeguarded and strengthened through the just solution of conflicts that risk disturbing the International chessboard? How can we achieve general and complete disarmament and thus avert the danger of possible nuclear confrontation? Lastly, how can the rights of peoples and human rights be preserved In a world where racial discrimination and economic Injustice are still upheld as a system of Stale and government?\n91.\tThese questions are of concern to all our peoples. Their solution clearly requires great sacrifice, but it is a necessary one which must be accepted if mankind is to survive.\n92.\tA rapid survey of world events demonstrates that there are many threats to international peace and security. In southern Africa, the practitioners of the odious system of apartheid are pursuing and intensifying their policy of racial repression. That inhuman policy obstinately practiced by the Fascist Pretoria regime constitutes both a defiance to Africa and a source of shame for the world community and at the same time, a genuine threat to international. peace and security.\n93.\tLast May, at Paris, the United Nations discussed that distressing problem. Recognizing that it was time the world community took forceful, urgent measures to eliminate the danger of apartheid, the Guinean delegation approved the PUris Declaration on Sanctions against South Africa. In this connection, we urgently appeal to all States strictly to observe the oil embargo by effectively implementing the economic sanctions invoked against the Fascist Pretoria regime.\n94.\tSimilarly, our delegation calls upon all peace- and justice-loving States to grant effective assistance to the liberation movements: the African National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress and SWAPO as well as to the front-line States, such as the People's Republic of Angola, which are suffering constant acts of aggression and bloody repression on. the part of the Pretoria regime.\n95.\tIn th face of the Fascist South African regime's repeated acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola, our delegation reiterates its unconditional support for and full and active solidarity with the people and Government of Angola. We urgently appeal to the international community to do its utmost to eradicate the unjust war situation created by South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola. There can be no excuse for the violent act of aggression committed by South African Fascist forces against Angola.\n96.\tIt is fitting here to point to the real and constant danger to all mankind and the African continent in particular posed by the possession of the nuclear weapon by the Fascist Government of Pretoria which, in attempting to impose its retrograde ideology and Inhuman policy, is liable to unleash a nuclear war.\n97.\tThe Powers that provide South Africa with their material, technical and technological support so that it can set up such a system of weaponry must shoulder full responsibility for it.\n\n98.\tThe overall situation in southern Africa is inseparable from the problem of Namibia. Following the failure of the meeting held at Geneva in January 1981 and the systematic refusal of the Western Powers to impose mandatory sanctions against South Africa, the General Assembly at its eighth emergency special session has just demanded the immediate implementation of the United States settlement plan endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978), which consists in the immediate imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa, under Chapter VII of the Charter, and the severing of all relations with the apartheid regime.\n99.\tThe delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea fully adheres to the spirit and letter of those decisions and denounces the abstention of the five countries of the contact group on this paramount question.\n100.\tSouth Africa's occupation of Namibia has no legal justification; therefore, the United Nations, in order to redress the situation, must find a definitive solution to the immediate decolonization of that African Territory by implementing its most recent resolution.\n101.\tIn the face of the defiance of the South African racist regime, which obstinately pursues its policy of occupation and exploitation of Namibia, our delegation urgently appeals to the entire International community to provide even greater material and moral support to SWAPO, which Is and remains the sole representative of the Namibian people.\n102.\tHotbeds of tension persist throughout the world. In Africa, the problem of Western Sahara was the subject of a resolution adopted at the eighteenth Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity held at Nairobi in June 1981 [AI36I534, annex II, resolution AHG/Res.103 (XVIII)]\n103.\tThat resolution, which advocates a ceasefire and the organization of a referendum hi Western Sahara tinder the auspices of the Organization of African Unity [OU/], with the co-operation of the United Nations, opens the way to a peaceful settlement of this problem, lb that end, the Ad Hoc Implementation Committee on Western Sahara of the OAU established by the Nairobi Assembly, held its first meetings from 24 to 26 August last in the Kenyan capital to consider ways and means of Implementing that resolution. The United Nations ii in duty bound to place its trust in the OAU and help it in the search for a just and honorable peace in Western Sahara.\n104.\tSimilarly, in connection with the situation in Chad, it Is essential, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the QAU, that neutral African troops be deployed with logistical support of the United Nations, with a view to maintaining peace and stability in that African country which is in such need of it following a long fratricidal war.\n105. We believe this to be the proper time and place to stress that the United Nations should respect recommendations adopted by regional or sub-regional organizations In order to find solutions to conflicts prevailing in their regions, taking into account the higher interests of international, peace and security.\n1O6. Hence, the partition status of the Comoros must be resolved without further delay by the return of Mayotte to the motherland. Africa wishes to place its trust in a sincere and constructive dialog between the French Government and the Moroni authorities. It is in this spirit that we feel, a successful outcome should-now be sought.\n107. The presence and maintenance of foreign military bases on the African continent, especially in the Horn of Africa, in the countries bordering on the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, is a source of grave concern to us. Therefore, we should like to draw to the attention of the States of the subregion the danger that the establishment of foreign military bases constitutes, not only for the independence and sovereignty of the States on whose territory they are to be found, but for all the neighboring countries. The Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea appeals to those countries to respect the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, as well as the guiding principles of the non-aligned movement.and the QAU, which condemn the establishment of any military base on foreign territory.\n108. Of all the areas that have been the subject of debate and have given rise to the largest number of resolutions, we can state without risk of contradiction that the ; problem of the Middle East is among those with pride of place. Since 1947, the date when the General Assembly adopted a resolution putting an end to the British Mandate and recommending the creation of two States \u2014Arab and Jewish - in Palestine and the internationalization of Jerusalem,, the question of the Middle East has remained at the center of concern of the international community. For 34 years now it has been the key to peace, the detonator of war. It should be remembered that mote than three major conflicts in the region have threatened the stability of the world. We affirm that the question of the Middle East is inseparable from the Palestinian problem, and has been for 34 years. It constitutes a potential source of large-scale conflict, a real threat to international peace and security, because it creates an embryonic war situation and a state of chronic, constant violence.\n109. In our view, the question of the Middle East cannot be resolved by the use of arms. The region will remain exposed to the dangers of war as long as hostility, doubts and mistrust exist among the peoples inhabiting it. In the view of the delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea, it is pointless to try to disregard the fact that the PLO has become the sole valid spokesman, without whom no viable solution can be contemplated. We remain deeply convinced that only a realistic approach will end the crisis and bring us to the desired peace. In this connection, the Government of the ; Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea welcomed most warmly the eight-point proposals for the setUenient of the Middle East question recently formulated by Crown Prince Fabd of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n110.\tIt is Impossible to speak of the Middle East without thinking of the fate of the Holy City of Jerusalem. That sanctuary of the three monotheistic religions is dear to the hearts of Moslems, Christians and Jews alike. That is why we regard as unjust and unacceptable the annexation of the city by Israel, and as even more intolerable the proclamation of the basic law of the Knesset, declaring Jerusalem to be the indivisible and. eternal capital of Israel.\n111.\tThis is compounded by the actions of the occupation authorities aimed at modifying the legal status of Al-Quds and changing , its cultural and religious character.\n112.\tThe situation in southern Lebanon is also a cause of concern. The constant acts of aggression by Israel against Lebanon, particularly In its southern part, are a violation of the Charter of the. United Nations and of international law,\n113.\tIt Is impossible to close this part of what I have to say without deploring and forcefully condemning the unjustified bombing last June of the Tamuz nuclear plant in Iraq by the Israeli air force. By that action Israel has claimed the right to deny a sovereign country the choice of the means for its development, above all by preventing it from using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. That is a dangerous act which must be forcefully condemned by the international community. A severe warning should be given to the. State of Israel against the repetition of such a clear act of aggression.\n114.\tAs regards the situation In Cyprus, we sincerely hope for the peaceful reconciliation of the two communities and reaffirm our complete support for the cause of the Cypriot people, for the strict respect of their territorial integrity and national independence, free of any foreign interference.\nUS. The situation in Asia is also a source of tension, which in the long run may degenerate into violent confrontation. We must bear in mind that the continued division of Korea is a potential source of International conflict of unforeseeable dimensions. We believe that the international community must clearly support, firmly and constantly, the just and legitimate aspirations of the people of Korea for peaceful and independent reunification, by transforming the present armistice into a lasting peace agreement, with the withdrawal of troops stationed in South Korea under the banner of the United Nations.\n116. The problem of Afghanistan remains deadlocked. We believe that in that country peace and stability require full respect of the will of the Afghan people to make their own choice freely, without interference in their internal affairs.\n117. The situation in Kampuchea remains a cause of friction which is of concern to us. Our delegation is aware that the solution to this problem is to be found not : in recognition or admission to the United Nations of one 'faction' to the detriment of another, but rather in the ending of all Interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea, with a view to safeguarding its sovereignty and national independence. This can be achieved only by a return to the legitimacy and legality which the regime of Prince Sihanouk has always embodied.\n118.\tThe Iraqi-Iranian conflict also remains unresolved. The many initiatives taken, inter alia those of the Goodwill Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference presided over by President Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea and comprising the Heads of State of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Gambia and Senegal, the Prime Ministers of Malaysia and Turkey, the leader of the PLO and the Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Mr. Habib-Chatti, have up to the present not managed to halt military operations and the fratricidal war is continuing and endangering the lives of the two brother peoples of Iran and Iraq and peace throughout the region,\n119.\tIn spite of these difficulties, the Chairman of the Goodwill Committee, President Ahmed S\u00e9kou T\u00e9rou, has asked that we reaffirm his determination to continue the action undertaken until peace is established between the two Moslem brother countries.\n120.\tConcerning the struggle for self-determination being waged by the people of East Timor under the leadership of FRETILIN,' we reaffirm our full support for that people in its struggle to. recover its independence and dignity.\n121.\tLatin America and the Caribbean have not escaped the many provocations and attempts at destabilization that foreign forces have been engaged in with regard to certain States in that region.\n122.\tThe Guinean delegation, aware of the fact that any foreign maneuver or intervention can always endanger the independence and sovereignty of States, is firmly against any interference in the internal affairs of another . State and against the use of force international relations.\n123.\tA solution to the disarmament problem must be found not only because of the astronomical sums allocated by the major Powers to the unbridled arms race, but also, and above all, because of the clear threat that It constitutes to the destiny of mankind at large.\n124.\tIn a world where the primary concern of peoples remains the preservation of peace, the manufacture and stockpiling of nuclear weapons is unjustifiable.\n125.\tThe development of new weapons of mass destruction will give new momentum to the already spiraling arms race.\n126.\tIn a spirit of true reconciliation within the great family of nations, our delegation supports the measures\nadopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, just as it supports the convening of a world conference on disarmament.\n127.\tLike the many hotbeds of tension, the economic insecurity of developing countries is a real threat to world stability.\n128.\tNeed we stress that the quest for peace and economic security for all remains our main concern and is undoubtedly the prerequisite for a more just world?\n129.\tIn this respect, it should be recalled that while the right to development is a fundamental right, making it possible for the human personality to develop, it remains a dead letter today for three quarters of the inhabitants of our world.\n130.\tWe are convinced that the international community is not unaware that the present international economic system is incompatible with the need of the developing countries to be guaranteed remunerative profits, free access to world markets and greater participation in the management of the world economy. The international economic order that exists today is unjust. The structures established during the colonial era are invariably maintained for the sole benefit of the industrialized  countries.\n131. Only a more just new international economic order would make it possible for our peoples to be offered the opportunities for full development, lb that cod, President Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 recently stated:\n\\\"The present economic system is iniquitous; it must be replaced. And it is a fact that the Powers that benefit from it will never be able or want to do that. They must be assisted by the developing countries which possess raw materials.\\\"\n132.\tIn the face of the lack of political will of the industrialized countries to promote the establishment of a just order, the developing countries have begun a peaceful struggle aimed, on the one hand, at establishing new structures for a more just North-South co-operation and, on the other; at promoting co-operation .among themselves that is, South-South cooperation.\n133.\tIt is in this framework that we place the Lagos Plan of Action' which, because it better reflects the aspirations and objectives of our peoples, must be the reference point for the United Nations in implementing the new International Development Strategy, as far as Africa is concerned.\n134.\tAlong the same lines, the international community must give sustained support to the efforts already being made to resolve the specific problems of the least-developed countries, of which more than two thirds are in the African continent.\n135.\tDare we hope that the recent Paris Conference on the Least Developed Countries constitutes a better approach to the problem?\n136.\tWe hope that instead of endorsing an inoperative delocalization of the process of production at the international level, which would be a mere redeployment, a surreptitious re-establishment of the old economic order, the international community will decide to revive during this session the global negotiations, which are at an impasse because of the reluctant attitude of certain Member States, especially, the industrialized countries. We are of the opinion that the United Nations remains the appropriate framework for those negotiations, which, following the logic of the North-South dialog, may be endangered in the long run If they are to be fragmented and conducted within certain closed clubs where the developing countries cannot participate effectively on. an equal footing with the developed countries.\n137.\tThe developing countries, in addition to the situation that we have just mentioned, are for the most part confronted with natural disasters, such as drought, floods .and many other catastrophes which heighten their chronic food deficit.\n138.\tThe international community, aware of those misfortunes, which seriously affect the fate of a large part of mankind, has so far applied only palliatives by sending food aid to the victim peoples, which become permanent beggars to which the rich give hand-outs.\n139.\tOn the basis of these considerations, the delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea appeals urgently to the entire international community to undertake substantive action involving massive assistance within the framework of the implementation of pilot projects which UNEP has decided to carry out.\n140.\tA victim of drought, our country attaches great importance to the project for the rehabilitation of the Fouta-Djallon massif planned by UNEP as part of its campaign against desertification under General Assembly resolution 34/185.\n141.\tThe present system of international relations is characterized by a climate of distrust that can threaten the neighbourly relations that should harmoniously govern inter-State relations.\n142.\tIn the face of the profound changes in international relations and the expressed determination of the great majority of Member States to participate responsibly in the solution of the major problems of our world, it Is essential that the United Nations system be made more dynamic and effective.\n143.\tIn this context it is today essential to adapt its structures and its method of operation, which at present do not respond to the demands of history in other words, to the dynamics of the general progress of the United Nations.\n144.\tHence the revision of the Charter to guarantee the equitable representation of all the regions of our world in the planning and decision-making bodies is a priority objective.\n145. I, confer upon the United Nations system all the powers it needs, to enable it to Intervene efficiently to settle conflicts by peaceful means, while favoring a balanced and egalitarian policy of co-operation among nations, Is to guarantee international peace and security and to preserve, mankind from a possible nuclear holocaust.\n146.\tAware of the United Nations mandate to safeguard and strengthen international peace and security, the delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea reaffirms its readiness to work effectively, in harmony with all States, to improve the climate of crisis and. tension that now prevails in international relations and to promote the building of a world of peace, justice  and progress.\n147.\tMrs. de AMORIM (Sao Tome and Principe) (interpretation from French): Once a year the great family of Members of the United Nations meets in these august precincts, out of respect for a rule, to honour a tradition, for some perhaps a ritual. But what they are essentially concerned with is the future of our planet and the progress of mankind. Every year we come here to pay obeisance to the principles, rules and conventions governing international relations. Every year each of us in this very place reaffirms this attachment to the principles of liberty, peace, justice, solidarity and autonomous development in co-operation. Through reflection and exhaustive analysis together we seek solutions for the. problems in which the world today has become mired.\n148.\tNevertheless, in Africa, the People's Republic of Angola, a State of law, of freedom, sovereignty and independence, has. been invaded, attacked and occupied by\n/. South Africa.\n149.\tNamibia continues its march of liberation on a path strewn with obstacles, arbitrary actions and the denial of the right to true independence. Apartheid, the disgrace of our century, enjoys privileges, and immunities.\n150.\tWestern Sahara is counting its dead and staunching its wounds, awaiting the referendum on self-determination. - \u2022\t' :\n151.\tSome sovereign countries feel threatened. External interference in their internal affairs is unacceptable.\n152.\tIn Latin America, the thousands of dead in El Salvador cry out for justice and will ensure victory against oppression and exploitation. Puerto Rico is fighting for recognition of its right to self-determination and independence. Elsewhere, the list of missing persons, of headless and tortured corpses is ever lengthening in the name of hope.\n153.\tIn the Middle East, Lebanon is battered and rent asunder, Palestine is being sacrificed, Iraq violated, the Tamuz installations bombed and Syria threatened. Zionist Israel enjoys privileges.\n154.\tIn the Mediterranean, the Republic of Cyprus, occupied and divided, is fighting for the preservation of its territorial integrity.\n24th muting\u20142 October 1M1\n155.\tIn Asia, the People's Democratic Republic of Korea is patiently weaving the thread of its peaceful reunification, so long awaited but constantly thwarted and hindered.\n156.\tBast Timor, annexed by Indonesia, Is the victim of a conspiracy of silence.\n157.\t. The new international economic order is not yet at hand. The affluent countries are exporting their own crises and spreading poverty. Disarmament can wait, particularly since the unbridled over-armament race is gathering momentum. The neutron weapon bespeaks longevity for real,.estate but merely the lifespan of a sigh for the living.\n158.\tWhat credence, can we give to words when facts, in their unendurable cruelty and provocation, mark the frontiers between oppression and freedom, between exploitation and social justice, between compromise and principles and, ultimately, between war and peace?\n159.\tFor the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tbme and Principe the incompatibility to which we have just referred stems from a conflict of interests between the aspirations and legitimate rights of peoples, on the. one hand, and the grip of domination and exploitation on the part of reactionary and imperialist forces, on the other, \u25a0\u25a0..-.,\t\u2022\u2022\n160.\tThe United Nations finds its expression in the fundamental principles upon which it was founded and to which all Member States have voluntarily and deliberately committed themselves, recognizing as highly positive the intrinsic value of those very principles for the preservation of peace and harmony among peoples.\n161.\tThe building of peace must be the most vital task of our peoples, governments and institutions. Any complicity, however infinitesimal, with imperialists and reactionary forces in their terrorist, barbarous and criminal activities constitutes a serious threat to the fragile edifice of international peace and security.\n162.\tThe United Nations remains, in spite of everything, the hope of oppressed and exploited peoples victims of aggression, whose rights are being violated; they recognize in the Organization a force at the service of peace, justice end progress.

        "file_text": "Speaking from this rostrum today, I should like first of all to recall that the United Nations enjoys solid credibility among the peoples of the world as a forum whose principal objective is to serve as an effective instrument for the maintenance of peace.\n45.\tIt is well known that the birth of the United Nations was the result of the peoples' determination to preclude another world tragedy. Its establishment reflected the awareness, deeply rooted in people's minds following the great victory over fascism, of the need for them to unite closely in the name of peace and to prevail over the forces of militarism and aggression.\n46.\tThat is why the very first lines of the Charter proclaimed the goal \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". These are clear and emphatic words.\n47.\tI should like to express the confidence that these words will never fade and will never lose their profound meaning. They are a solemn oath taken by the founding States when creating the United Nations. Today that is the duty of all the 155 countries represented in the United Nations.\n48.\tThere, there are some who now try to contend that there are things more important than peace. However, it is obvious that the peoples have never authorized those leaders to say this on their behalf. Peace is a priceless asset of all people oil earth; it is a decisive prerequisite to progress in any sphere of human endeavor. That was true in the past, and it is all the more true now.\n49.\tAS Leonid Brezhnev has stressed, \\\"The safeguarding of peace no other task is more important now at the international level for our party, for our people and for all the peoples of the world. By safeguarding peace we are working not only for the people who are living today, and not only for our children and grandchildren; we are working for the happiness of countless future generations.\\\"\n50.\tActing on that fundamental assumption, the twenty sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union the highest forum of the Soviet Communists recently put forward a whole series of proposals on the key problems of international life, which have evoked a broad response in the world. They provide for far-reaching steps designed to limit arms, eliminate hotbeds of tension and strengthen confidence among States. They cover both the political and the military fields, deal with nuclear missile weapons and conventional armaments and bear upon the situation in Europe, in the Near, Middle and Ear East and in other regions of the world. Underlying these proposals is one single desire: to improve the international climate, to ward off the threat of war.\n51.\tIn the international arena the Soviet Union stands shoulder to shoulder with other socialist States. Recently, during their meetings in the Crimea, the leaders of the parties and countries of the socialist community had an opportunity once again to harmonize those countries' assessments and actions in the light of the situation taking shape in the world. The same purpose is served by regular meetings\\\" of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty and by the activities of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.\n52.\tThe foreign policy of the socialist countries has been and continues to be a policy of peace. It follows from the very nature of our social system, of whose advantages we are deeply convinced. It is determined by the fact that under this system there are no social strata which would make profits out of war and war preparations or derive benefits from militaristic policies. Nevertheless, we do not impose our social system on anybody. The peoples themselves determine, and should determine, their destinies. That has always been and remains the cornerstone of the scientific world outlook that guides us in both our domestic and our foreign policies.\n53.\tIn building a society free from social and national exploitation and oppression, the socialist countries are following an unexplored path. This is not always easy; but the laws of social development and the strength of our ideals ensure for the socialist countries a steady advance in all spheres of life.\n54.\tFutile are the attempts by certain circles in Western countries to interfere in the internal affairs of the socialist States. Such attempts are being made, in particular, with regard to the Polish People's Republic. No small effort is being made to shake loose the socialist foundations of the Polish State. It will be recalled, in this connection, that the leaders of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty made the following statement:\n\\\"It was reiterated that socialist Poland, the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish people can firmly count on the fraternal solidarity and support the Warsaw Treaty countries. The representatives of the Polish United Workers' Party stressed that Poland has been, is and will remain a socialist State, a firm link in the common family of the countries of socialism.\\\"\n55.\tThe Republic of Cuba is coping with the tasks of socialist development and pursuing a policy of peace in difficult external conditions. The Soviet Union has invariably supported and will continue to support the Cuban people in their struggle to safeguard their sovereignty.\n56.\tHostile, criminal intrigues against Cuba on the part of the United States, which have of late been stepped up, must cease. Washington does not like socialist Cuba, but it may well be asked whether the social system of the United States is to everybody's liking. No one has the right to tell the Cuban people how they should manage their internal affairs.\n57.\tIn a bid to besmirch the socialist countries, their social system and their peaceful policies, all kinds of fabrications are being resorted to, and those who resort to them seem to be competing with one another as to who can come up with the most preposterous invention. Some even go so far as to predict an early sunset of socialism. 1 wonder how long it took them to find that word \\\"sunset\\\". These people seem to be endowed with a remarkable gift of inventiveness, but I must say that they do not seem to have a very good idea of the objective processes of historical development. Are they looking for the sunset in the right country? Is that where they should be looking? Are they not looking in the wrong direction?\n58.\tHow many were the prophets who predicted the downfall of socialism, but what of it? Their prophesies have invariably fallen by the wayside, while history has continued inexorably to follow its course.\n59.\tThe Soviet Union has never threatened and is not threatening anybody. Since the days of Lenin, peace and friendship among nations have been inscribed on the banner of the Soviet State, and we have invariably been true to this ideal. Today it is as dear to the people of our country as it was in Lenin's day.\n60.\tIn examining and solving international problems we rely on the ideals of the freedom and progress of nations, on the principles of respect for the independence of all States and all peoples, and aim to consolidate the foundations of life rather than prepare the funeral of mankind.\n61.\tThere exists, however, another trend in world politics, which has quite different goals. It is the course followed in the militarist circles of imperialist States. The sum and substance of that course is to seek domination over other countries and peoples, a domination that means imposing one's will upon them, their economic exploitation and the use of their territories for military strategic purposes. Washington is ever more frequently heard to speak about the American leadership of the world, though no one has entitled the United States to claim such leadership.\n62.\tThe architects of that course see as the main instrument for achieving their objectives, the whipping up of international tensions and the use, as they put; it themselves, of methods of force in politics. Even when they occasionally recognize in words the possibility of a diplomatic alternative they hasten to make it clear that diplomacy, unless it relies on force, does not suit them.\n63.\tThe most typical manifestations of that policy line are: a further whipping up of the arms race; an overt claim to military superiority over the Soviet Union; the setting up of a wide network of military bases and the stationing of American troops on foreign territories; the undermining of the basic principles of SovietAmerican relations worked out earlier as a result of tremendous effort; pressure on other States, particularly in Europe, to curtail their political, trade and economic ties with the socialist countries; and slanderous propaganda against countries adhering to the positions of peace and ejecting claims to world leadership by no matter whom.\n64.\tAnd what great pains are taken to drag the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] allies into following that policy. When arguments are lacking and there is a constant lack of them to support such a hopeless and dangerous course crude pressure is brought to bear, so as to give no respite to those who are not always eager to accept militaristic schemes alien to their interests.\n65.\tIt is sometimes said that Washington's present policy does not rule out prospects for developing relations between the USSR and the United States. However, in the same breath it is immediately demanded that our country should change neither more nor less its conduct in international affairs to satisfy American interests. In other words, the Soviet Union must give up defending its legitimate interests, give up its foreign policy.\n66.\tTo put forward such demands is to show a lack of seriousness. The Soviet Union will continue to pursue its course of Leninist peaceful policy. Our country does not intend to deviate from it. We do not encroach on the legitimate interests of others, but nor shall we forgo legitimate interests of our own, including commitments to our allies.\n67.\tIt is to be hoped that Washington will yet be able to take a more sober view of the actual state of affairs, adopt a more realistic approach to international affairs and not overestimate its capabilities while underestimating the capabilities of others.\n68.\tIn order to build policy on a realistic basis one should seek, not clashes and conflicts with other countries, even though those other countries have a different social system, but rather the settlement of controversial problems at the negotiating table.\n69.\tFor our part, we reaffirm once again and the USSR delegation is authorized to say it from this rostrum that the Soviet Union has not sought, nor is it seeking, confrontation with the United States of America. We should like to have normal businesslike relations with the United States. As is known, we are in favor of a dialog in order to seek mutually acceptable solutions to controversial problems. But we are not begging for such a dialog, we are proposing it.\n70.\tAt every session of the General Assembly many States emphasize, quite rightly, that the peoples are greatly endangered by the policy of crude interference in the internal affairs of other countries, support for bloodthirsty dictatorial regimes hated by their own peoples and an all out encouragement of oppressors and hatchet-men of every stripe, including the Pol Pot experts in genocide.\n71.\tThe methods and forms employed in pursuing such a policy are varied. Recently, the United States has all but launched a crusade against international terrorism, leveling accusations against one country after another. These accusations, however, are misdirected. They are utterly false. Terrorism is looked for not where it should be sought and where it really is to be found.\n72.\tThe scheme here is simple to tag the label of terrorism on the struggle of peoples against colonialism and its vestiges. In other words, it is the policy of oppression, cursed by peoples, which is pictured as a struggle against terrorism. At its basis lies unwillingness to take into account the rights of peoples to manage their domestic affairs as they see fit, and refusal to accept social changes occurring in the world.\n73.\tAnd surely, the events in El Salvador are a fitting illustration of the policy of imperialist interference in the affairs of other peoples. A real massacre has been committed there before the eyes of the whole world. Patriots defending the independence of their country, thousands of peaceful civilians are being killed. It is well known who is in charge there. And all this goes on at the very moment when we are all sitting in session here in the General Assembly Hall.\n74.\tWhat is happening in EI Salvador arouses the legitimate indignation of all honest people on earth. Regrettably, the United Nations has not, yet lifted a finger to assist in putting an end to these crimes against a whole nation.\n75.\tAnd how should one view the policy of shameless pressure exerted on Libya and, in particular, the recent armed provocation against that country? Or take the so called rapid deployment force. Apparently, its formation is regarded in Washington as a great invention. But there is nothing great in it. It is nothing but a policeman's club intended to ensure crude interference by the United States in the affairs of independent States and to stifle the freedom of peoples.\n76.\tAt this world forum one cannot ignore either the concept of \\\"American vital interests\\\" cited in justification of such a policy. This concept is importunately repeated in almost every official statement by Washington on the subject of the international situation. It is interpreted in such a way as to enable the United States to declare any part of the world a sphere of its interests and to take any steps there, all the way up to the use of force.\n77.\tEurope, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, they are all there. It seems that the only area still missing is the South Pole, but it too may soon be added. Everything is there except the right of the United States to do all this. Neither the United States nor any other country has been granted the right to hold sway over the entire globe. This is nothing but arbitrariness.\n78.\tAs is known, a whole United States naval armada has been assembled in the Persian Gulf. This action is directed against Iran, against the Soviet Union and against a number of independent countries of Asia and Africa. The United States Navy must leave this area. It has nothing to do there, nothing to defend. That would be a sensible act.\n79.\tNeither the size nor the power nor the resources of this or that State give it the right to impose by force or threat of force its will on other countries and arbitrarily to declare any part of the world as a sphere of its vital interests. If such a right were to be recognized for any country or group of countries, then, apparently, all instruments of international law should be destroyed. Indeed, little would be left then of the United Nations Charter itself.\n80.\tThe ruling circles of a number of NATO countries now worship but one god an unrestrained arms race. Everything that serves this end is acceptable to them. This arms race is invariably accompanied by a torrent of speeches and permeated with militarist frenzy, including speeches by top level statesmen. Those who advocate inflated arms programs resort to any means imaginable. Deception is held in special esteem by them. They deceive one another, they deceive the people, they deceive their kin and strangers alike. They launch a rumor and the next day they quote it as the truth.\n81.\tThe most salient element of deception is the myth of a \\\"Soviet threat\\\". It is repeated endlessly, to the point of stupefaction, day and night. In this manner it is easier to confuse people and extort money for armaments. In these conditions decisions are taken on a huge, increase in military expenditures such as history has never before known.\n82.\tThe urge to expand their military presence wherever possible has now acquired the element of a real Bacchanalia, with half a million United States troops stationed in more than a dozen countries.\n83.\tToday the policy of the United States is beset by such an obsession, especially in setting up military bases near the borders of the Soviet Union and the areas adjacent to it. Of course, the States against which these bases are aimed have to take all this into account so as safely to protect their security.\n84.\tWho would believe that it is concern for peace that motivates the accelerated pace of the development of ever new types of weapons, including MX intercontinental ballistic missiles, Trident submarine-launched missiles, the new strategic bomber, various types of cruise missiles and many other things?\n85.\tWhat is the purpose of all this? The purpose is to try and upset the established strategic balance, obtain military supremacy and, on this basis, impose one's will upon others.\n86.\tThe Soviet Union condemns this policy as adventurous. The whipping up of the arms race is madness. This has been repeatedly recognized by many political and public figures in the world, scientists and men of culture. Mankind must be saved from it. The present balance of military power is fully in line with the interests of peace and international stability.\n87.\tOur country has never sought, nor is it now seeking, military superiority. Those who make^ claims to the contrary should not be believed. Leonid Ilich Brezhnev has said this to the entire world many times, and, inter Alia, directly to American Presidents on various occasions. But we shall not permit others to become superior to us. We shall of course adequately meet any challenge so as to maintain the balance of power.\n88.\tHowever, the Soviet Union has not done, and is not doing, anything beyond what is absolutely necessary to ensure a peaceful life for its people and the security of its allies and friends. We believe that the ruling circles of NATO know all that. Yet, they do not want to admit that there is no Soviet threat whatsoever, nor do they want to give up practicing deception.\n89.\tIndeed, what would then be left of exhortations about the need for the notorious \\\"additional armament of the West\\\"? Nothing would remain. That is the reason why use is made of incomparable indicators and of .falsified data on strategic arms, on medium-range nuclear systems in Europe, on armed forces strength of the two sides in Central Europe or on any other aspect of the correlation of forces.\n90.\tIf, by any chance, some NATO official happens to concede that the Soviet Union has really never overtaken the United States and that parity is still there, there immediately follows a tongue lashing from above. And then the record of \\\"Soviet military superiority\\\" is played again in order to support another increase in military appropriations and to substantiate some freshly baked militaristic doctrine.\n91.\tIn some capitals such doctrines pop out as if rolling off the assembly line. Things may well reach the stage where any bureaucrat, especially if he is in the spotlight, will, once installed in an executive office, immediately come up with a strategic doctrine of his own concoction. Thus, quite recently, the world was presented with a \\\"discovery\\\" according to which nuclear war in general should not be feared too much, that it is \\\"admissible\\\" and \\\"acceptable\\\". This is a shameless deception designed to mislead the peoples and paralyze their will to struggle against the nuclear threat.\n92.\tIf the arguments of the proponents of the militaristic policy course are left free of deliberate vagueness and intricacy, and of claims to originality, there remains only one thing, namely, the urge to intensify the arms race, in breadth and in depth, without any restraint.\n93.\tBut have the authors of these militaristic doctrines asked 500 million Europeans, 470 million Africans, 360 million Latin Americans, 2.5 billion Asians and finally, their own people whether they want to perish in the flames of war? Certainly not. They just do not care.\n94.\tThe instigators of the arms race would like to discard everything that hampers their plans. If to this end it is necessary to renege on the obligations already assumed, that is what they do. Thus, the United States refuses to ratify the SALT II Treaty.\n95.\tNegotiations had been under way for many years before the Treaty was finally agreed upon and signed. Now they say that this Treaty is not to the advantage of the United States and that it is inequitable. Of course, this is not true. The balance of interests of the sides was accurately established and preserved in the Treaty. This is known to anyone familiar with its contents. Therefore, that is not the point. The point is that it is this very principle of equality and equal security reflected in the Treaty which is not to someone's liking.\n96.\tCounting on people's ignorance, they seek to sap the Treaty by alleging that it does not envisage strategic weapons reductions. But this is not true either. The Treaty explicitly envisages such reductions, and on a substantial scale,\n97.\tIt is also obvious that, once agreement has been leached on strategic arms limitation and the initial reduction of their levels, it is easier to solve the task of their more radical redaction so that the balance reflects a lower arms level.\n98.\tAll that convincingly proves that the significance of the Treaty already agreed to and signed is as great today as at the time of its signing.\n99.\tHow numerous were the cases when talks on the limitation of armaments were held both in the period between the two world wars and after the Second World War. Yet any unbiased person will undoubtedly admit that none of those talks produced results that could be compared even to a small extent to the SALT I agreement, which is in force, and especially to the SALT II Treaty, which has not become operative.\n100.\tNow a question arises: why smear both the treaty and the SALT process itself? Yet exceptionally reckless politicians are now saying that the entire problem is not urgent at all, at least not till the United States implements its most sweeping arms buildup plans.\n101.\tJust think of the absurdity of such a stand. The nation which claims to be the most powerful in military terms says \\\"Let me first increase by so many times my armaments and then perhaps I shall talk about their limitation.\\\"\n102.\tWhat is the main factor in such a stand? Is it aggressive designs it) politics, greatPower expansionist ambitions, a striving to impose on the world monstrous plans for an ever greater stockpiling of weapons for the annihilation of people instead of manufacturing things of material goods, or a desire to have an inexhaustible source of excess profits for those who manufacture armaments? It is hard to say. Most likely it is a complex mixture of all these things.\n103.\tThe United States decision to start the production of the neutron weapon aroused great indignation in the world. That decision is a new step towards intensifying the arms race, towards aggravating the world situation.\n104.\tThe peoples clearly say that they strongly oppose the fiendish neutron weapon, rightly considering it to be a particularly inhuman type of mass-destruction weapon. The neutron weapon must be totally banned. A ban must be imposed on both its production and its use.\n105.\tWashington has long been making attempts to hold back or even to wreck the negotiations initiated earlier on a number of important problems. Unfortunately, quite a lot has already been done to that end. That was the case, for example, with the talks on the Indian Ocean, on limiting conventional arms transfers, on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests, and on the prohibition of the production of chemical weapons and the destruction of their stockpiles.\n106.\tIt is also appropriate to mention here the current efforts to cast aside the results of many years of work by States within the framework of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n107.\tOther developments in international life also have their impact on the world situation. Attention is attracted to the ever-increasing closeness between Washington and Peking.\n108.\tWho would object to the desire of two countries to have normal relations between them? Nobody would, of course. It is the basis on which this is done that matters. In this particular case the basis is openly hostile to many States, above all to the Soviet Union, and hostile to the cause of detente.\n109.\tIt has been proclaimed to the world that the United States intends to sell weapons to China and to help it build up its military potential. And this is done at a time when Peking is pursuing a policy that runs counter to the interests of peace, a policy of hegemonism and aggression.\n110.\tThe establishment of military cooperation between the United States and China with Japan, for reasons that no one knows, getting involved in it will be duly taken into account by the Soviet Union and, we believe, by other States.\n111.\tFor its part, the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed the conviction it was recently reiterated by Leonid Brezhnev from the rostrum of the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the Chinese people's interests would best be served by a policy of peace. The Soviet Union would like to build its relations with the People's Republic of China on a good neighbor basis. We have repeatedly reaffirmed that our proposals for normalizing these relations remain valid.\n112.\tThese are the main reasons, as we see them, for the recent exacerbation of the international situation.\n113.\tWhat is the conclusion that follows from all this? According to the ideologists of militarism, mankind is to expect a pitch-dark night, an endless spiraling arms race, further conflicts and clashes.\n114.\tThe Soviet Union and, we are sure, many other countries hold different views as to the prospects for world developments. Pessimism and a feeling of doom are alien to our nature. We are convinced that to prevent war is not only necessary 'but also possible if this is actively fought for. Hand in hand with all States, our country is prepared to wage the struggle for curbing the arms race, removing the threat of war, settling outstanding problems. In this respect we are not politically allergic to any partner, irrespective of differences in social systems or ideologies.\n115.\tThe immediate and most pressing task today is to struggle for easing world tensions, curbing the arms race, eliminating * threat of war.\n/\n116.\tThe Soviet Union proposes that the General Assembly, acting on behalf of all Member States of the United Nations, adopt a declaration solemnly proclaiming that States and statesmen who would be the first to use nuclear weapons would commit the gravest crime against humanity.\n117.\tThere are and can be no grounds or motives, there are and can be no circumstances or situations which would give a State the right to be the first to use nuclear weapons. It would be a crime against all the peoples, against life itself on earth.\n118.\tIt is likewise necessary to warn that there will never be any justification or pardon for statesmen who would make the decision on the first use of nuclear weapons. To proclaim this in a declaration so that these words be heard in every capital, in every part of the world, would be to remind statesmen who, by virtue of their official position, are involved in making decisions on the use of nuclear weapons, that each and every one of them is personally responsible for the destinies of mankind.\n119.\tWe propose that the declaration further state loudly and clearly that any doctrines allowing for the first use of nuclear weapons are incompatible with human moral standards and the lofty ideals of the United Nations.\n120.\tIt is also most important to draw the attention, especially of leaders of nuclear-weapon States, to the fact that their supreme duty is to act in such a way as to eliminate the risk of outbreak of a nuclear conflict.\n121.\tThe declaration should stress that the nuclear-arms race must be stopped and reversed by joint effort, through negotiations conducted in good faith and cc the basis of equality. What is meant here is that the energy of the atom should be used not against life but for the sake of life, not for the production of weapons but for scientific progress, for improvement of the living standards of people, that is, exclusively for peaceful purposes.\n122.\tThis is the essence of the political document that we are proposing for adoption. We hope that this proposal will meet with wide support.\n123.\tThe adoption of such a document may become a major landmark on the path towards complete elimination of the threat of a nuclear conflict. No single country should stand aside from the solution of this problem.\n124.\tThe Soviet Union is in favor of a dialog on all aspects of the problem of ending the arms race, on all controversial international issues, in favor of a bilateral or a multilateral dialog.\n125.\tFrom time to time statements are made which seem to express willingness to negotiate. However, attached to this willingness are all sorts of conditions, linkages and unequal approaches of all sorts. If someone really intends to negotiate in this vein, we must say outright: nothing will come of it. Negotiations can be successful only if they are conducted on the basis of Compliance with the principle of equality and equal security.\n126.\tThe Soviet Union is prepared and has been prepared for a long time to resume negotiations with the United States on the limitation of strategic weapons.\nGiven mutual desire, headway in the solution of this problem can be made, relying on what has already been achieved and preserving the results achieved.\n127.\tThe SovietAmerican negotiations on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe will apparently be resumed unless winds start blowing again in Washington in a different direction. Of course, the question of limiting medium-range nuclear weapons and those of corresponding forward-based nuclear systems of the United States should be examined and settled concurrently and in organic interrelation, with due account of all factors determining the strategic situation on the continent.\n128.\tOur country has proposed that the moment negotiations begin, a moratorium should be imposed on the deployment in Europe of new medium-range nuclear missile systems of NATO and the USSR. This proposal is based on the existing approximate parity of their respective armaments. The establishment of a moratorium would certainly exert a favorable influence on the climate of the negotiations.\n129.\tThe Soviet Union is prepared to reach agreement on limiting and, what is more, on reducing medium-range nuclear systems in Europe. As Leonid Brezhnev stated at Berlin on 6 October 1979:\n\\\"We are prepared to reduce the number of medium range nuclear weapons deployed in western areas of the Soviet Union from their present level, but only, of course, in the event that no additional medium-range nuclear weapons are deployed in Western Europe.\\\"\n130.\tAt the same time we must make it quite clear that should the other side artificially drag out the negotiations and start to deploy new medium-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe, the Soviet Union will have to take measures to restore the balance.\n131.\tFor the purpose of strengthening peace in Europe, it is also important to break the deadlock at the Vienna negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. The socialist countries have done a good deal to ensure progress at the Vienna negotiations. Should the Western partners show a minimum of goodwill, a solution could be found.\n132.\tOf great significance is the question of convening a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe. As is known, this question is under discussion in Madrid at the meeting of representatives of the States participants in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n133.\tWishing to contribute to success, the Soviet Union has gone far to accommodate the West and has declared its willingness to include the entire European part of its territory in the zone of confidence-building measures, provided, of course, the Western side makes a corresponding step in turn. What is required now is precisely such a step,\n134.\tMilitary detente on the European continent is intended to strengthen and complement political detente. But this does not depend on us alone.\n135.\tThe Soviet Union is prepared to hold negotiations on all areas of limiting the arms race and of disarmament.\n136.\tUnder current conditions, it is becoming increasingly important to prevent military competition from extending to outer space. Each day brings new evidence that outer space can become an arena of the arms race.\n137.\tAt* the request of the Soviet Union, an item entitled \\\"Conclusion of & treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space\\\" has been included in the agenda of the present session [item 128], The Governments of all States represented here have had an opportunity of familiarizing themselves with the Soviet draft of that treaty. The draft takes into account all major aspects of the problem. We would like the exchange of views on the basis of the Soviet Union's proposal and its outcome to be constructive.\n138.\tWith reference to the need to take measures for curbing the arms race and for disarmament, special note should also be made of the importance of efforts to resolve conflict situations in various parts of the world and to prevent the emergence of new hotbeds of tension. States are capable of coping with this problem provided they strive to ensure a more durable peace.\n139.\tThe struggle of Arab peoples to defend their legitimate rights, trampled underfoot as a result of Israel's aggression, elicits understanding and support on the part of an overwhelming majority of countries. If justice has not so far been restored and the situation in the Middle East remains dangerous, it is because those in Israel's ruling circles persist in their expansionist policies and do not stop their brutal terror against the people of Lebanon, while influential forces outside that area actually encourage this policy and seek to follow the pattern of the anti Arab Camp David deal,\n140.\tPeace and stability in the Middle East can be assured only through a comprehensive political settlement which would not infringe on the rights of any country or people of that region. Such a settlement must envisage the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967 and the exercise of the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including the right to establish their own State.\n141.\tThe Soviet Union consistently comes out in support of the Arabs' rights and stands for the elimination of the consequences of Israeli aggression. There is growing understanding that the path to a Middle East settlement lies through the convening of an international conference with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO].\n142.\tA political settlement is needed for the situation created around the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, against which an undeclared war is still being waged. The principal role in this is played by the United States, and Peking is not far behind.\n143.\tUnfortunately. Pakistan, whose territory serves as the main bridgehead for armed incursions, in effect avoids negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Yet, who else but Islamabad should be primarily interested in establishing lasting peace in the region?\n144.\tThere has been some talk recently about the proposal by certain Western countries to convene an international conference on Afghanistan. But what is striking is that, while the conference is to be on Afghanistan, the main party concerned, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, has been forgotten. This forgetfulness conceals the attempt to have the internal affairs of Afghanistan, a sovereign nonaligned State, examined in a forum composed of other States, without even the participation of the Afghan Government. Of course that approach is unacceptable.\t. ,\n145.\tThere is a basis for a political settlement; it is simple and, given goodwill, can be translated into reality. A constructive program to this effect was set forth in the statement by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on 24 August of this year [see AI36/457].\n146.\tThe political settlement must ensure the termination and non-resumption of armed or other interference in the affairs of Afghanistan. Such a settlement, including reliable international guarantees, would permit the establishment, by agreement between the Afghan and Soviet sides, of modalities and timing for the withdrawal of the limited contingent of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.\n147.\tIn SouthEast Asia, too, there is no other way but negotiations to reduce tensions in the area. We support the well-known proposals by Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea [see A/36/86, annex I, para. 4], including the proposal to hold a regional conference with the participation of the. countries of IndoChina and the States member's of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations.\n148.\tHowever, no one should assume that the maneuvers under way around the nonexistent Kampuchean question can result in anything but harm. It is inadmissible that, under the cover of some pseudo-conferences, executioners overthrown by the people of Kampuchea or former princelings should be imposed once again on that people. They have already made their choice.\n149.\tAlso doomed to failure are the attempts to cast a shadow upon the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which extended a helping hand to the Kampuchean people in their struggle for freedom and independence.\n150.\tAttention is drawn to the fraudulent allegation put forward in typical Washington wrappings that someone somewhere in SouthEast Asia used toxic chemical substances said to be of Soviet make. It is quite obvious that at work here are those who are themselves guilty of such crimes. Now they are trying to cover their traces.\n151.\tThe situation in the Far East, too, offers possibilities for positive political action. One such could be an agreement on the application of confidence-building measures in the region. The implementation of such measures on a collective or a bilateral basis would make a useful contribution to the cause of detente in that region. The Soviet proposal on this question has been communicated to all the States concerned. We expect that in this regard they will display the required sense of responsibility.\n152.\tThe Korean question still unsettled and thus an old source of tension in the Far East can and must be solved by peaceful means. In our opinion, a suitable basis for solving the problem is provided by the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea presented by its President Kim II Sung at the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n153.\tRecently the Mongolian People's Republic has taken a timely initiative by proposing a convention on mutual nonaggression and renunciation of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific [see A/36/388]. Our country supports that idea.\n154.\tThe Republic of India is making a major contribution to maintaining stability and peace in Asia and ensuring international security. We value highly its peaceful constructive policy. SovietIndian relations, which rest on the solid basis provided by the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation, are in the interest of our two peoples and positively serve the interests of peace.\n155.\tPolitical means can also be effective in settling other dangerous situations and controversial problems, including the conflict between Iraq and Iran, the Cyprus problem, the situation in Western Sahara and that in the Horn of Africa. The indispensable requirement in this regard is that nobody be allowed to pit one State against another and to capitalize on conflicts between them. There should be no room for imperialist intrigues in those areas.\n156.\tAs is well known, the South African racist regime and its accomplices are engaged in maneuvers aimed at thwarting the decolonization of Namibia. It is a matter of honor and is the immediate duty of the United Nations to help the people of Namibia gain their freedom. The racists and all those on whom they rely must realize that the time or colonialism is past.\n157.\tAn end must be put to South Africa's aggressive gangster-like actions against the People's Republic of Angola and a number of other African countries. It is necessary to condemn those actions, to demand that South Africa cease its armed intervention and to adopt international sanctions against it. It is precisely this approach that has recently been manifested by the overwhelming majority of members of the Security Council in voting on a draft resolution submitted by Mexico and other countries.3 However, the United States has prevented the United Nations body from taking inappropriate decision, thus openly defying the African peoples and world public opinion.4\n158.\tThe United States support for South Africa constitutes direct assistance to the aggressor. Such a course must be resolutely condemned. The United Nations should do everything that is needed to put an end to the aggression and call the aggressor to order. The resolution recently adopted by the General Assembly at its emergency special session on Namibia [resolution ES8/2] is a step in the right direction.\n159.\tThe nonaligned movement, which has recently marked its twentieth anniversary, has become an important factor in world politics.* The Soviet Union expresses its solidarity with the anti-imperialist orientation of the nonaligned movement and supports its activities in the interest of strengthening peace.\n160.\tMuch is now being said about the problem of relations between the industrialized and the developing\nStates. Various bodies, narrow and broad, of the North South type are being proposed. It is obvious, however, that nobody will produce positive results unless developed capitalist States radically change their approach to developing countries, cease discrimination in economic relations with them and renounce the economic plundering of those countries,\n161.\tOur country will continue to give developing States the necessary support in their struggle for economic independence and for the restructuring of international relations on a genuinely equitable and democratic basis.\n162.\tThe activities of the United Nations cannot be assessed in terms of standard units of measurement. A formal one-dimensional assessment cannot be applied to them. There are, however, grounds for saying that the United Nations has done quite a lot to enable the peoples of the world to live with greater confidence in their future.\n163.\tWorking actively with other socialist countries in all areas of international politics, the Soviet Union continues to make proposals aimed at strengthening peace.\n164.\tNo problem, no matter what its magnitude, can or should overshadow the principal purpose for which the United Nations was created, that is, to preserve peace. It is the individual and collective duty of all States and the duty of every statesman to do for this purpose everything within the capability of human beings, of their intelligence, of their energy and of their dedication to life and its most noble ideals.\n165.\tIt is clearer now than ever before how enormous are the challenges confronting the peoples to meet the rapidly growing needs in the fields of energy, food, health and education, to explore the oceans and outer space, to preserve nature. These problems can be solved provided mankind saves itself from war.\n166.\tEverything should be done to ensure that in the remaining two decades of the twentieth century people can live in conditions of peace and can cross the threshold of the third millennium of our era, not with fear for the future of our civilization, but with confidence in the boundless prospects for its development. All nations, large and small, that work towards this end will always find the Soviet Union at their side.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, on behalf of my delegation, to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the \nthirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is pleased to see as President a representative of a brother country, the Republic of Iraq, with which my country has fraternal and privileged relations.\n217.\tYour competence, your talent as a skilled diplomat and your vast experience will, I am convinced, enable us to accomplish our work successfully.\n218.\tMay I also, Mi. President, pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar, of the Federal Republic of Germany, who, with competence and devotion, did so much to seek satisfactory solutions to the many problems that arose during his term of office.\n219.\tI should also like to express my heartfelt congratulations and words of welcome to the Republic of Vanuatu and Belize. I am convinced that these two countries will find support and assistance in this Assembly.\n220.\tI also wish to express my deep gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral for his tireless efforts to carry out his difficult tasks in order to preserve the ideals for which the Organization was founded. We commend his unfailing perseverance in carrying out his duties as guardian of the principles of the Charter.\n221.\tEvery year the General Assembly opens a new session at which we once again gather, inspired by great hopes and with a firm resolve to promote peace, solidarity among peoples and international cooperation.\n222.\tIn accordance to the principles of the United Nations, the Republic of Djibouti has chosen to follow a policy based on the preservation of its independence and the maintenance of its sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom and national identity. We try to harmonize national and international endeavors in a spirit of cooperation and understanding towards all nations, because such endeavors could prepare the ground for a better development of peace and prosperity.\n223.\tAt the beginning of the \nthirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, in spite of the deterioration of the international economic situation, the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held at Paris from 1 to 14 September 1981, has given rise to great hopes by making it possible for the international community to become aware of the seriousness of the' problems facing those countries. It is none the less true that the measures adopted at that Conference must be placed in the framework of the global development strategy aimed at establishing a more just and more equitable new international economic order.\n224.\tThe Djibouti economy is characterized by its weakness. There is a high rate of urban growth, the industrial and agricultural sectors are almost nonexistent and subsistence activities are low. This weakness is mainly due to the preponderance of the service sector, which depends a great deal on the international situation. The massive population flow following our independence refugees, immigrants, victims of the drought and the rural exodus have posed acute problems in all socioeconomic fields.\n225.\tAfter a drought which lasted three years and caused the displacement of more than one third of our rural population, whom the Government regrouped in camps in order to meet their needs, floods this year have worsened our economic situation.\n226.\tThe Republic of Djibouti, with a population of 450,000, has welcomed a large number of refugees, who today make up 15 per cent of its population and with whom it shares its meager available resources without regret and with dignity. That is its way of meeting its international and humanitarian responsibilities.\n227.\tThe Republic of Djibouti, in the framework of its national policy, has given priority to all those projects that will allow it to involve itself in the process of socioeconomic development in order to guarantee to all the enjoyment of their social, economic and political rights without obstruction, within the limits of its resources and in the interest of all the people.\n228.\tBut, in order to achieve those development objectives, the support and assistance of the international community are needed. I take this opportunity to repeat our gratitude to, and appreciation of, all the friendly countries and international organizations for their assistance and support, both material and moral.\n229.\tPeace and stability are vital for each nation, for they are the two prerequisites for development and thus for socioeconomic emancipation at the national and international levels. The Republic of Djibouti is engaged in establishing peace and stability, not only at the national level but at the regional and international levels.\n230.\tStrongly committed to African unity and solidarity, the President of the Republic, Mr. Hassan Gouled Aptidon, is worried by the continued hostilities in the Horn of Africa. Deeply inspired by the need to establish peace and security in the region, the President has committed himself to the task of creating mutual trust and cooperation among the nations of the region. On the basis of that commitment, President Gouled made an appeal in August 1980 for an attempt to bring about a negotiated settlement of the conflict in the region. In March, April and May 1981 he began a series of official visits to the countries of the Horn of Africa and other neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and South Yemen. During those visits the President of the Republic found among his fellow leaders a conviction of the need to seek the possibilities of establishing peace and security in the region, in the interest of the peoples of the Horn of Africa.\n231.\tWe believe that, thanks to the understanding and confidence of all, those goodwill efforts may lead ^tangible results.\n232.\tSince its accession to national sovereignty, the Republic of Djibouti has ceaselessly maintained and strengthened its fraternal relations of cooperation and solidarity with the other countries of the region. The two pillars of our foreign policy are dialog and cooperation, to which we attach great importance.\n233.\tWe are committed to, and comply constructively with, the principles of the establishment of peaceful, active coexistence in relations among all nations. We are firmly opposed to imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, apartheid and racism including Zionism, racial discrimination and other forms of oppression and elimination.\n234.\tThe Republic of Djibouti is at one with the principles and goals of the nonaligned movement. In the implementation of the ideals stemming from those principles and goals, all Member States should harmonize their efforts to maintain the prestige and unity of our movement.\n235.\tDuring the past decades, the Indian Ocean has been a focal point of superPower rivalry for zones of influence because of its economic and strategic importance and its importance in the sphere of energy. TTie Republic of Djibouti, as a coastal State, is deeply concerned by the escalation of tension in the region. We support the goals and objectives of the United Nations resolutions aimed at preserving the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, and attach particular importance to them. In this respect, we are pleased by the decision contained in General Assembly resolutions 34/80 B and 35/150 to convene a conference on the Indian Ocean at the beginning of the 1980s in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to give effect to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, contained in General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI). This can contribute to the establishment of peace and security in that region.\n236.\tWe reaffirm the urgent need for the prompt implementation of that Declaration, and repeat our full support for a successful conference on the Indian Ocean as soon as possible.\n\n237.\tThe situation in the Middle East is a source of great danger to peace and stability, not only regional but also international, for the Zionist entity ceaselessly violates the sovereignty and independence of Arab countries. Hie premeditated and criminal acts of aggression by Israel against the Arab nation have increased to dangerous proportions, portending disaster for mankind.\n238.\tThe escalation of violence and the intensification of the Israeli expansionist policy of colonialism in the occupied Arab territories, the intensive and brutal attacks that have recurred in southern Lebanon, the annexation of Jerusalem for the in-intentioned purpose of altering the character of the Holy City, Israel's continued and provocative refusal to withdraw from Lebanese territory, the bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor and the plan to build a canal from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea are all deliberate acts of provocation which maintain an explosive state of tension in the region.\n239.\tIt is highly regrettable that all the solutions proposed to date to remedy the crisis in the Middle East have been marked by great weakness in tackling the heart of the question. The whole world Is aware that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without complete recognition and granting of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to return to its homeland and to establish an independent State there. All attempts to find solutions to the Middle East crisis must consider and fully accept the participation of the PLO, the sole representative of the Palestinian people, as a fully fledged partner in all negotiations concerning the future of the Palestinian people.\n240.\tThe Arab countries have always wished to live and to coexist in just and lasting peace, guaranteeing to all parties independence, peace and security. Contrary to this, Israel has constantly shown complete defiance of all moral values and international norms.\n241.\tIsrael's isolated and barbaric actions are no longer convincing even to its fervent partisans in the United States and in Europe, who continue to give it unlimited support to the detriment of the legitimate rights of the Arab peoples.\n242.\tWe wish to reiterate our unconditional support for and solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people, under the auspices of the PLO, its sole representative, for its inalienable rights.\n243.\tWe wish to welcome here the peace efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and we support the peace settlement presented by His Royal Highness Prince Eahd ibn Abdul Aziz.\n244.\tThe attempt to eliminate the Lebanese people is a clear extension of Israel's virulent strategy of aggression whose sole goal is to destroy the Arab nation. Israel's continued violation of Lebanon's air space, territory and territorial waters and its intensive attacks against highly populated areas in Beirut, killing thousands of civilians, and causing severe destruction, are all living examples of that strategy. The whole world has on many occasions condemned the Israeli plan to sabotage Lebanese sovereignty and has reaffirmed the urgent need to protect the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon. The international community must take more concrete measures to preserve Lebanese sovereignty.\n245.\tApartheid, which has been unanimously condemned by the United Nations as a crime against humanity and against human conscience and dignity, considerably aggravates the situation in southern Africa and seriously disturbs world peace and security.\n246.\tTension and confrontation in southern Africa cannot be eliminated nor can peace be established until Namibia's liberation from the illegal occupation of the South African regime and the dismantling of the apartheid system are completely achieved. It is not enough to rise up against apartheid or to raise .n outcry. The system must be condemned concretely by active support for the struggle waged by the liberation movements in providing them with the best possible moral, material, political and diplomatic assistance.\n247.\tThe barbaric South African regime continues its policy of repression. The policy of bantustanization, the blind violence against peaceful demonstrators opposing apartheid, the political trials followed by imprisonment, the torture of political prisoners and the assassinations while in detention are but a few examples of the horrors existing in South Africa under the Pretoria regime, which continues to defy the relevant United Nations resolutions.\n248.\tWe appreciate the fact that the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, sponsored by the United Nations in cooperation with the OAU, held in Paris last May, has considered new international actions to eliminate apartheid and to support the struggle of the liberation movements.7 We support measures aimed at a total arms embargo against South Africa and in particular at preventing it from acquiring the nuclear weapon.\n249.\tConcerning Namibia, the current impasse presents a crisis situation that endangers peace and security in the region. It is clear that the South African regime does not accept a negotiated agreement on the basis of the United Nations plan on the question of Namibia. In defiance of all international norms, it continues to engage in barbaric acts and systematically to detain leaders of the liberation movement, all in order to stifle the success of the liberation movement, strengthen its occupation of Namibia and carry out its campaigns of aggression against neighboring States.\n250.\tThe Republic of Djibouti firmly condemns the aggression perpetrated against the fraternal people of Angola by the despicable regime in South Africa.\n251.\tThe international community, in view of its responsibility regarding the Namibian people, must no longer remain impassive when faced with the acts of aggression committed by the South African regime. It is high time that Governments and organizations which maintain economic, political and diplomatic relations with South Africa cease their activities, express solidarity with the Namibian people and participate in common efforts to speed up the decolonization of Namibia.\n252.\tWe reaffirm our support for SWAPO, the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people, in its armed struggle to achieve self-determination, liberation and national independence.\n253.\tWe firmly believe that the only basis for a just negotiation on the Namibian question is the correct implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which requires fair elections under the supervision of the United Nations in keeping with the principles of self-determination and genuine independence for Namibia, as well as of resolution ES8/2 adopted during the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly on Namibia.\n254.\tThe delegation of the Republic of Djibouti is deeply worried by the conflict between Iraq and Iran. We hope that the two countries will resolve their differences in accordance with the principles of the Islamic Conference and of the nonaligned movement. We welcome efforts at finding a peaceful solution of the IraqiIranian war and we ask the nonaligned movement, the Islamic Conference and the United Nations to redouble their efforts to achieve fruitful results in order to restore peace to that region.\n255.\tAs regards the question of Western Sahara, we are greatly encouraged by the continued efforts made by the OAU to put an end to the dispute by peaceful means. The establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU is a demonstration of goodwill and commands our full support.\nWe support proposals that will make it possible for the people of Western Sahara to exercise its right to self-determination in accordance with the recommendations of that Committee.\n256.\tThe continued presence of foreign armed forces in Afghanistan in spite of the repeated appeals of all peace loving nations for their withdrawal prevents the Afghan people from expressing its will by choosing its government through free elections. That aggression and military presence also endanger the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and nonaligned status of the countries of the region. My Government has on many occasions denounced this foreign military intervention in Afghanistan as a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and as an act of aggression against human rights and the freedom of peoples. We insist upon an overall political solution based on full respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and nonaligned status of Afghanistan.\ni\n257.\tIn connection with the question of Kampuchea, the serious international consequences of the situation in that country have become a source of concern to my Government, which is opposed to foreign armed intervention and the presence of foreign forces in any country. We reaffirm the need for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the territory of Kampuchea as well as the organization of elections supervised by the United Nations in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.\n258.. We firmly believe that the United Nations is the most appropriate forum for the bringing together of ideas in order to find the most favorable means of resolving all vital questions concerning the general development of mankind. We believe in the United Nations. In that spirit we join the other Member States and share their concerns and their aspirations.\n259.\tOur strength resides in the extent to which we respect and comply with the objectives and principles on which the Organization is based.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "99.\tMy delegation wishes to express its great satisfaction at Mr. Kittani's election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. As he is a fellow representative of an Asian State with which my country has very close relations, it is also a source of great pleasure to us to see him preside over our deliberations. It is most fitting that one renowned for his commitment to the cause of cooperation among nations as well as for his deep dedication to the work of the Organization should lead us during the current session. We are sure that he will distinguish himself and the Assembly through his leadership.\n100.\tMy delegation also wishes to convey its deep appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar, for the efficient manner in which he guided the deliberations of. the thirty-fifth session and the eighth emergency special session. The record of his dedicated and determined leadership, especially in furthering international cooperation, gained the admiration of the Assembly.\n101.\tI should also like to express our respect and appreciation to the SecretaryGeneral for the able and dedicated w< j in which he has consistently promoted the objectives of the Organization and for the many initiatives that he took in the course of the year for the promotion of global peace.\n102.\tMy Government and people salute the Governments and peoples of the Republic of Vanuatu, a neighboring Pacific Ocean State, and Belize on the attainment of their independence. We welcome them warmly to the Organization and look forward to fruitful cooperation with their delegations.\n103.\tWhile the decade of the 1970s was characterized by perplexing and complex problems, this was until recently also a world in which the danger of war between the great Powers had considerably lessened, thanks to an increased willingness to undertake negotiation rather than confrontation. We had in fact hailed detente as a process of great importance in easing the atmosphere of suspicion and enmity, thereby greatly enhancing the prospect for more constructive relations between all countries. Thus, the trend of events in the 1970s offered us hope that less emphasis would be put on armaments or ideological rivalry in the conduct of international relations and that the world would be moving finally from strife and confrontation to peace and prosperity.\n104.\tUnfortunately, our optimism has proved ill founded. Instead of a progressive relaxation of tension, once again confrontation and strife plague various regions of the world. Political and economic pressures, the use and threat of the use of force and subversion have again become dominant features of present day international relations. Indeed, tensions have reached such frightening proportions that a minor conflict can now ignite a conflagration or have repercussions of worldwide dimensions.\n105.\tThe crisis in detente has affected the security of the world, especially that of the smaller and weaker nations. The continued stalemate in the NorthSouth dialog has further widened the inequalities between the industrialized nations and the third world. The intensified rivalry among great Powers, their frantic efforts to expand their spheres of influence and domination and the escalation of the frenzied arms race to unprecedented levels have led to the worsening of the global situation and have dissipated the hopes for a stable world order. In brief, the world is relapsing into the old order of spheres of political and economic influence based on hegemony and dependence. This tendency must be avoided, and our collective determination should be directed towards correcting this dangerous drift.\n106.\tHistory has shown that such determination was evident in and demonstrated by the nonaligned movement two decades ago when the world was on the brink of war. As we observe the twentieth anniversary of its founding with a special item in the agenda of the plenary, meeting, it is fitting to recall that the movement made very, significant contributions to defusing the danger of confrontation threatening mankind with extinction at that time. Since then, the nonaligned movement has consistently worked to further the cause of disarmament, peace and security, as well as national liberation. It has opposed foreign domination, imperialism, racism and hegemonism, rejected military alliances, power blocs, spheres of influence and the more dangerous manifestations of greatPower confrontation. The movement has correctly assessed the negative trends in the current economic situation as being rooted in the disequilibrium and asymmetries of the international economic system and has called for its restructuring.\n107.\tNow when the world is faced with the return of the old order of international power politics, the movement is again called upon to reassert its responsibility as an independent non-bloc factor and play a more decisive role in the preservation and strengthening of peace and security.\n108.\tIndeed, as the movement is commemorating the twentieth anniversary of its founding, we must all recognize that its continued strengthening is indispensable to arrest and reverse the frightening escalation of tension. The nonaligned States can respond to these challenges by stoutly upholding the true principles which they enunciated at Belgrade, by adhering to their political and economic systems, free from external pressures, and by refusing to be drawn into the antagonism of greatPower politics.\n109.\tThe nonaligned movement also recognizes its historic responsibility by playing a dynamic role in resolving international conflicts, especially in halting the ever-spiraling arms race and in the establishment of a new system of international relations based on freedom, equality and justice. I am confident that in this very difficult phase of international relations the contribution of the nonaligned countries to strengthening world peace, and their role, deriving from their traditional strength, insights and dedication, will become even more crucial and evident. This role will be played constructively, especially in the United Nations, for the peaceful resolution of disputes and for strengthening the Organization and its efficacy.\n110.\tMy delegation would now like to address itself to some of the major problems affecting various parts of the world, problems that have continued to occupy our attention.\n111.\tThere has been no change in the situation in Kampuchea. There has beer, no withdrawal of foreign troops, and no elected government has been installed to give expression to the people's right of self-determination. Against this bleak background, it is indeed heartening to note that the International Conference on Kampuchea was held in July with the participation of an overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations, thus underscoring the international dimensions of the conflict.\n112.\tThe Conference adopted a set of proposals that could lead to a comprehensive political solution by bringing together the warring factions in the peace process. Noteworthy among those proposals are measures for the withdrawal of foreign forces, a ceasefire and the disarming of all factions so that elections supervised by the United Nations can be held, thus enabling the people of Kampuchea to regain their sovereignty and nonaligned status. We believe that those proposals can form the basis for negotiations leading to the emergence of a new Kampuchea, free from foreign interference and dedicated to the welfare of its people and the peace of the region.\n113.\tThe Conference also set up an ad hoc committee to establish contact with all the conflicting parties and to be a vehicle for facilitating the search for a comprehensive solution. My delegation is confident that that committee dan play an active role in the formulation of constructive proposals acceptable.to all. We look forward to the day when Kampuchea will regain its rightful place in the comity of nations and will no longer be used by others for actions inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter.\n114.\tWe are happy to note that after two years of integrated emergency aid operations, the people of Kampuchea, although still in dire straits, are no longer in danger of mass Starvation. However, the fate of the Kampuchean refugees who fled their homeland remains bleak, and further international assistance to rescue them should be provided.\n115.\tThere is no doubt that the establishment of peace in Kampuchea would promote stability SouthEast Asia and speed up the creation of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in the region. The establishment of such a zone, which has been endorsed by the countries of the region and by the United Nations, is the express will of the peoples of SouthEast Asia for ensuring conditions of peace and tranquility. The countries of the region have dedicated themselves to secure the recognition of, and respect for, SouthEast Asia as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers. Thus they are committed to rid the region and their countries of foreign political and economic hegemony, and they refuse to be used as an instrument of policy of any outside Power. They are convinced that only within that framework can the region be removed from bigPower rivalry or even bigPower confrontation. It is their firm belief that only through such an approach can they build their societies and live with each other in conditions of peace and fraternity.\n116.\tOn the question of Afghanistan, my delegation is also convinced of the need for a comprehensive political solution as a way out of that dangerous situation. Elements for a solution, including the withdrawal of foreign forces, have already been included in the declaration adopted by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of NonAligned Countries, held at New Delhi in February [see A/361116 and Corr.l, annex]. Within the framework of that declaration, further consultations should be held to prepare the ground for the reemergence of an independent and nonaligned Afghanistan. In this regard, we laud the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral, his Special Representative and other parties, as well as the constructive attitude shown by Pakistan, to facilitate negotiations to achieve a political solution and ensure that the Afghan people will be able to determine their own destiny free from foreign intervention and interference.\n117.\tDespite the growing consensus in the international community on the modalities and principles for a Middle East settlement, the situation there has of late dramatically worsened. Israeli indiscriminate bombing of Beirut, resulting in massive casualties and destruction, coupled with its military raid on the nuclear installation in Iraq, has rightly earned the condemnation of the world community and has threatened the viability of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The ceasefire achieved in Lebanon with the cooperation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] has demonstrated beyond doubt that that organization is a responsible body and can be a reliable partner in the search for peace based on justice.\n118.\tIt is sad to note that for too long the Middle East conflict has been enmeshed in greatPower politics and that, in the onward rush of the major Powers to confrontation, the crux of the problem has become secondary, and their strategic and other interests have gained preeminence. The central issues in the Middle East continue to be unconditional* Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territories, including Jerusalem, and the upholding of the right to self-determination and independence of the Palestinian people. Until those issues are resolved, the Middle East will remain the most critical danger point in the world.\n119.\tIn the context of the Middle East situation, my delegation joins others in urging Iran and Iraq to redouble their .efforts to seek a peaceful solution to their conflict.\n120.\tIn Africa, no progress has been made towards the independence of Namibia, despite the overwhelming wishes of the international community. South Africa's defiance was clearly exhibited at the Geneva pre-implementation meeting. For this same reason many other diplomatic efforts also failed to bear fruit. However, we believe that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provides a solid framework for achieving self-determination and independence for Namibia and that any changes or modifications of that resolution will not bring Namibia's freedom nearer. The Security Council itself has failed to play its assigned role in the maintenance of international peace and security by enforcing its resolution 435 (1978) through the imposition of sanctions against the Pretoria regime for its defiance of that resolution. The need for Security Council action was highlighted when that regime used Namibian territory as a base to launch its recent aggression against Angola.\n121.\tFaced by such continuous failures, the international community convened the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, which has now called for comprehensive mandatory sanctions on, and for the total isolation of, South Africa [resolution ES8/2]. My delegation fully supports the resolution and is committed to its implementation. Hie question of Namibia is a question of illegal occupation, pure and simple. It is therefore disquieting to note that extraneous issues are being injected to stifle the progress towards freedom in Namibia.\n122.\tDespite United Nations condemnation of apartheid as a crime against humanity and the dignity of man, the Pretoria regime has not displayed any willingness to adhere to the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Now, when the struggle against apartheid is reaching a crucial stage, international unity should be maintained; any breaking of ranks amongst those of us who abhor apartheid will only encourage South Africa to sustain that abominable and odious system. Meanwhile, before the Security Council adopts decisions to force South African compliance, Member States should scrupulously implement the unilateral sanctions agreed on by the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa held in Paris in May [see A/36/319, annex /].\n123.\tIt is self-evident that the present tendency towards global brinkmanship is not conducive to disarmament. The world is very concerned and disappointed that disarmament negotiations have not produced any tangible progress, as it had high hopes that concrete results would follow the decisions of the first special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. The only achievement giving us some hope was the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.5\n124.\tIt is essential, therefore, that serious negotiations begin in order to arrest the momentum of the arms race. Although the Committee on Disarmament has been in existence for over three years, it has not been able to initiate serious negotiations on questions that have been accorded the highest priority, namely, the comprehensive nuclear test ban, the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. For those reasons the second special session on disarmament has assumed greater importance, and we should proceed with renewed determination to ensure its success.\n125.\tEfforts to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace have, regrettably, reached an impasse. The arms buildup, both on land and at sea, has intensified in the general area, leading to a deterioration in the climate of peace and security in the Indian Ocean region. If we are unable to reverse this trend, we may in fact be entering a more dangerous period in which confrontation with all its disastrous consequences will finally be inevitable. For those reasons Indonesia believes that it is imperative that serious efforts be exerted to convene the proposed conference to implement the Declaration. The deterioration in the military and political situation in the area cannot and should not serve as a pretext to postpone the conference; on the contrary, it should set the stage for such a conference.\n126.\tMy delegation had placed considerable hope last year in the forthcoming Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. However, crucial issues relating to its preparation have remained unresolved. In view of time constraints, we urge more determined efforts by the States involved to overcome the remaining obstacles in order to enhance international cooperation in space exploration, science and technology for the benefit of mankind, especially for the developing countries, which space technology could greatly benefit.\n127.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, during its recent session at Geneva, succeeded in overcoming a number of major difficulties, despite the reluctance of the United States to commit itself to the agreements already reached. The painstaking endeavors over the course of the past seven years of negotiations have resulted in the formalization of the informal draft convention. My delegation is confident that all States will extend their wholehearted cooperation to ensure the successful conclusion of the Conference. Indonesia, together with the overwhelming majority of participants in the Conference, looks forward to a definitive, final session in New York next spring and the signing of the convention later in 1982 at Caracas.\n128.\tFor a number of years the picture of the world economy has become increasingly bleaker, offering us no optimistic outlook for the near future. Ominous warnings indicative of a world economy experiencing greater instability than at any time since the Second World War have sent shock waves throughout most of the developing countries and many of the developed countries as well.\n129.\tMore than ever before, mutual economic survival is now at stake. In the developing countries, severe external pressures have led to increased poverty and degradation of the quality of life and, in many cases, have shattered prospects for achieving social and economic goals. In consequence, the gap between the rich and the poor nations has widened further.\n130.\tIn my opinion, there persists an inconsistency between our recognition of the state of the world economy and the vacillations on the part of some Members about committing themselves to a commensurate remedy. For some time now the reality of interdependence has been increasingly evident, not only between countries but also between sectors of the economy. Therefore, we could not meaningfully address problems through ad hoc and piecemeal measures. Yet, shortsighted considerations and narrow self-interest unfortunately still persist, thereby inhibiting some from joining the consensus for a global solution.\n131.\tMy delegation is deeply disappointed with the failure of the international community to launch the global negotiations in accordance with the schedule already agreed upon. We note with great concern that the momentum already generated is now being dissipated. Yet these disappointing setbacks do. not weaken our belief that the comprehensive approach, as embodied in the proposed round of global and sustained negotiations within the framework of the United Nations system, is the only one capable of genuinely solving the real problems confronting the world economy.\n132.\tIndonesia is firmly committed to a process of dialog and cooperation and deeply believes that, no matter how intractable the current international economic problems remain, they are still solvable through such a process and in such a spirit. My delegation therefore appeals once again to those who are still opposed to joining the consensus for launching a global round of negotiations to reconsider their position. In this regard we share the hope that the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held at Cancun next month will assist in effecting a breakthrough in the present stalemated situation and thereby stimulate the launching of the global round.\n133.\tThe operational activities of the United Nations development system have also felt the full impact of the grim economic situation. The disappointing result of the recent pledging conference is now further aggravated by the prospect of new deficiencies in resource mobilization for the coming years.\n134.\tMy delegation has already stated on an earlier occasion that we are deeply concerned with these adverse trends in the availability of resources for operational activities of the United Nations development system. Such prospects not only create problems among the recipient countries but also do not augur well for the future of multilateral cooperation for development. It is therefore essential for all of us, in particular all developed donor countries, to spare no effort in providing the United Nations development system with the necessary resources on an increasingly predictable, continuous and assured basis.\n135.\tThe United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi recently, was certainly a major step forward towards cooperation in this field. However, while we welcome the adoption of the Program of Action at the Conference, we very much regret the continuing opposition by some major developed countries to certain specific proposals of the Program. Therefore we earnestly hope that the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh session will be decisive in solving the still pending problems of institutional mechanism and financial arrangements.\n136.\tBy the same token, we welcome the recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris. Although it must be admitted that the Substantial New Program of Action adopted by the Conference has fallen short of our expectation, it nevertheless has given us renewed hope for a revitalization of the development of the least developed countries. This positive step is essential not only for addressing the worrisome problems besetting the least developed countries, but, it is hoped, also for furthering the overall prospects for revamping international cooperation for development.\n137.\tOn the more positive side of this rather grim picture of the world economic scene is the steady progress achieved in the pursuit of collective self-reliance among the developing countries. SouthSouth cooperation, while not designed to be a substitute for the restructuring of NorthSouth economic relations, is a crucial imperative of our times for altering the legacy of endemic colonial economic patterns and structures that have stymied the efforts to accelerate the development of the developing countries. In this connection we salute the progress registered at the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries held at Caracas and the meeting on technical cooperation among developing countries held in New York.\n138.\tWhile we recognize that the primary responsibility for the development of the developing countries resides with those countries themselves, it is also, obvious that the international community has a useful role to play. It is our firm conviction that the international community should create a fully supportive environment for these efforts because they too, in fact, have a vested interest in the success of SouthSouth collaboration. Indeed, a stronger and more prosperous South would have great dynamic potential for revitalizing the ailing international economic situation and the stalled NorthSouth negotiations. _\n139.\tIt is widely recognized, even by the developed countries, that the successful adaptation to growing world economic interdependence and the stronger resilience of the developing countries are important factors in world stability. The dawning of this global consciousness gives us renewed hope. In this spirit we must lose no time and spare no effort in marshaling our collective resolve and political will to build a new economic order of accelerated development and structural change.\n140.\tIn this context, the organs and organizations within the United Nations system could and should play a crucial role, and to this end it is imperative to equip them with the necessary means. My delegation is among the first to urge efficiency and economy. But we are of the view that efficiency and measures of economy should not be misused by setting arbitrary limitations that would impair the system's ability to implement legitimate Programs and activities, because the United Nations system with all its weaknesses still remains our best vehicle for channeling our concerted efforts to achieve our goal of social and economic development.\n141.\tI have painted a gloomy and pessimistic picture of the world situation, but, despite the many obstacles which lie in our way, we must be steadfast. Our ability to find solutions to the major issues of which I have spoken may well determine man's capacity to survive in the decades to come. Unless we accord these problems the necessary priority, we run the risk of soon reaching a point where they will be beyond peaceful and rational solution.\n142.\tMy delegation is confident that faced with tasks of such enormous proportions, our common search for peace and security is not mere daydreaming about accomplishing the impossible. Man's intellectual capacity and his technological prowess and sheer determination in the past have succeeded in taming mighty rivers, making the desert bloom and sending man to the moon. Let us, therefore, not abandon our hopes and ideals for a peaceful, better and more equitable world, but rather muster the will and determination to make these hopes and ideals come true.\n"

        "file_text": "101.It gives me pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to wish you every success in carrying out your task.\n102.\tI also congratulate Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar, the outgoing President, whose efforts were instrumental in ensuring the significant results achieved by the General Assembly.\n103.\tI take this opportunity of welcoming the admission of Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu as Members of the United Nations. We look forward to the independence of peoples still suffering under racist and colonialist regimes and to their admission to this international Organization.\n104.\tDespite all the efforts exerted by the various United Nations organs and conferences to consolidate the pillars of peace and security in the world, to ease world tension, to contain and defuse difficult crises and hotbeds of tension, the world is still witnessing an escalation of tension and a persistent endeavor to create problems and crises. That is mainly due to the wish of world imperialism to return to the cold war in a new form, to extend its domination as far as possible, to create spheres of influence, to acquire military bases and facilities, to amass armed forces in specific preas and to deploy destructive nuclear missile networks. All those acts have pushed the world again into an atmosphere of cold war, besides creating hotbeds of conflict that may explode at any moment and the effects and extent of which would go far beyond their regional limits.\n105.\tIn that context, for example, the United States has set up a rapid deployment force designed for action in the Arabian Gulf region. We have also noticed the expansion of United States military bases in third-world countries and an increase in military fleets in the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. The United States, after having tried to deploy nuclear missiles in Western Europe, has started to manufacture and store the neutron bomb, thus increasing the factors of horror and terrorism and the risks of destroying the world and annihilating mankind.\n106.\tThe world is facing difficult crises which with the passage of time are increasing in number and in complexity, especially since the renewal of neo-colonialist activities, plans for domination, expansion and hegemony, and the qualitative and quantitative expansion of armaments.\n107.\tIn the face of that situation it is imperative to struggle persistently to restore detente and expand its framework. This could be achieved by the participation of all States, on an equal footing, in shaping the policy of detente so that it would acquire the necessary international dimensions. The process of detente must be based on justice and the right of peoples to self-determination so that it may become a positive factor in guaranteeing international peace and security and in the establishment of a new order of international relations in various fields.\n108.\tDisarmament remains a complex issue. General Assembly resolutions and United Nations efforts have so far failed to achieve results which would benefit the whole of mankind and safeguard future generations and human civilization. On the contrary, today we notice an escalation of the arms race, particularly in the field of weapons of mass destruction. The most significant example of this is the United States decision to manufacture the neutron bomb. We are also witnessing a grave expansion by the United States in the establishment of military bases and the concentration of troops and fleets in certain areas. Therefore it is high time for the Assembly to take decisive measures to curb the arms race and the establishment of foreign military bases, as well as to reduce forces and limit their deployment. Thus the world could feel that its international Organization was firmly and sincerely striving to spare it the misery of a destructive world war.\n109.\tIt is an established fact that if disarmament is to be carried out and to attain its objectives it must be accompanied, in practical terms, by the elimination of colonialism, racism and Zionism and of all aspects of aggression and occupation, hegemony and domination, spheres of influence and foreign exploitation. Peoples must be guaranteed respect for their independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty and right to self-determination.\nA\n110.\tIt should be pointed out in that connection that racism and racist regimes, especially in occupied Palestine and South Africa, represent an acute and dangerous problem. Those regimes are engrossed in their racist practices and aggressive expansionist policies. They are consolidating collaboration among themselves in various fields, particularly in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Consequently, the regions dominated by those regimes have become, because of the weakness of the international deterrent, explosive hotbeds which endanger international peace and security and directly threaten the security and independence of the African continent and of the Arab world.\n111.\tIn the face of this grave problem, the Assembly must take a firm stand based on the will of the international community. We have persistently confirmed our absolute support and backing for the national liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia in their struggle to secure the rights of their peoples to self-determination, independence and national sovereignty. We also stand firmly on the side of the African front-line States in facing the brutal racist aggression and the maneuvers aimed at liquidating the liberation causes of the peoples of southern Africa. We declare our firm support for Angola against the military aggression carried out by the racist regime in South Africa and call on the international Organization to impose the maximum sanctions against the racist aggressors.\n112.\tWith regard to Afghanistan, we are of the view that the Afghan Government has the right to defend the independence of Afghanistan against all forms of outside interference in its internal affairs. Afghanistan is of concern to us because of the historic and cultural ties between us and its membership in the nonaligned group, and we are anxious that it should remain nonaligned. Therefore we consider it important and necessary for negotiations to take place between the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its neighbors in order to reach a political settlement that will ensure the security and stability of that region and safeguard Afghanistan's unity, independence and nonaligned status.\n113.\tThe problem of Cyprus remains unsolved. The talks between the two Cypriot communities are still stagnating. We earnestly hope that a solution will be found, based on United Nations resolutions, within the framework of respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, unity and nonaligned status of Cyprus.\n114.\tThe Korean issue also remains unsolved. The Korean people is still divided into two parts. The solution lies in implementing the joint communique signed in 1972.5\n115.\tEndeavors by the various United Nations specialized agencies and bodies are still continuing with a view to setting up a new international economic order. They have achieved no tangible result so far, despite the suffering and difficulties facing most countries of the world, particularly the developing nations. In our view, the main cause of the failure is the obstacles that are continually being placed in the way of establishing that new order by the advanced industrial capitalist States and their clinging to the privileges they enjoy under the present unjust economic and monetary system, which is based on exploitation. As a consequence, the will of the international community has been paralyzed and all efforts in this regard have so far failed.\n116.\tIn the face of that situation it is incumbent upon the Assembly and the various United Nations bodies to multiply their efforts to set up a new international economic order, since it would be a vital factor in ensuring prosperity and stability for the peoples of the world and in safeguarding international peace and security.\n117.\tOne of the most dangerous sources of tension in the world today is the Israeli aggression against the Arab nation in Palestine and in the occupied Arab territories. Despite the dangers which this issue poses for international peace and security, in view of the unique location of the Middle East region at the junction of three continents and because of the huge energy reserves it contains, the prospects of peace in that region seem to be almost nil.\n118.\tThe international Organization has adopted many resolutions since the inception of the Palestine problem and the creation of the Zionist entity in Palestine and its occupation of other Arab territories. Those resolutions, however, have so far remained mere ink on paper as a result of Israel's rejection of them, because of the Zionist expansionist doctrine, and because of the unlimited support given to Israel by the United States.\n119.\tThe United Nations has defined the following principles for a just peace in the Middle East: first, a just solution to the Palestine problem based on granting the Palestinian people their right to self-determination, repatriation and the establishment of their own independent state on their national soil; and secondly, Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem.\n120.\tThe United Nations linked its decision to admit Israel to the Organization to Israel's agreement to implement United Nations resolutions on the Palestine question. Nevertheless, all those resolutions and all international efforts to pave the way for peace have collided with the Israeli barrier, because Israel rejects any peace that is not based on Zionist doctrine and that does not recognize as legitimate the occupation practiced by the Zionist entity.\n121.\tSeveral years ago, following the October War of 1973, there appeared to be a possibility of seeking a just peace through the United Nations. Numerous efforts were made to make use of that possibility. However, those efforts soon came to nothing because of the involvement of the Egyptian Government with Israel and the United States in the Camp David agreement, followed by conclusion of the \\\"peace treaty\\\" between the Egyptian and Israeli Governments.\n122.\tThe Camp David process led to the following results.\n123.\tFirst, it resulted in a political and military imbalance in the region in Israel's favor as a result of the defection of the Egyptian Government and its abandonment of its national obligations towards the Arab world in general and towards Syria and the Palestinian people in particular. Obviously a peace process undertaken when there is an imbalance of power means full capitulation by one party to the other, because any conflict that arises as a result of the clash' of powers can be resolved only through the restoration of the balance of power or the liquidation of one party by the other.\n124.\tTalk of peace and its possibilities while an imbalance of power exists would mean the imposition of terms of surrender. That is completely unacceptable. The history of conflicts in the world proves that agreements involving injustice to one of the parties constitute a smoldering cause of the eruption of a new conflict when the conditions are ripe.\n125.\tSecondly, the conflict in the Middle East is of a comprehensive nature, between the Israeli aggressor and the Arabs. An agreement between the Israeli aggressor and one Arab Government does not mean a solution has been reached or the conflict ended. Rather, it means a complication of the situation and an increase of tension, as proved by subsequent developments in the region.\n126.\tPrior to the Camp David agreement, the region was the scene of an ArabIsraeli conflict. Nowadays, there is a heightening of tension between the Arabs and the Israeli aggressors/ as well as the development of a new hotbed of tension between the Egyptian Government and all other Arab Governments, and also a further series of explosions threatening the security and stability of the region. All developments since the Camp David agreement have indicated that unilateral or partial solutions are an additional cause of tension and further complicate the existing problems.\n127.\tThirdly, there is the problem of American involvement in the region. In the initial stages of that involvement, the United States played the role of a partner in the negotiations; later) it assumed the role of a partner in the relations between the Egyptian and Israeli Governments, and Anally it took on the role of a military and political partner, through the recent strategic alliance with Israel.\n128.\tThere is no doubt that one of the gravest consequences of the Camp David agreement is United States military involvement in the area and the establishment of military bases in a number of countries of the region, as well as the increased presence of naval fleets and the formation of the rapid deployment force. All those actions are being carried out to impose United States hegemony on the region and hence increase the tension between the peoples of the region and the United States Government. There is also a resulting increase in tension between the two superPowers, which is an additional cause of international tension and a clear threat to world peace and security.\n129.\tFourthly, the discussion by the Egyptian Government, in negotiations related to the rights of the Palestinian Arab people, of so-called Palestinian autonomy completely contravenes all United Nations resolutions, which recognize the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and consider the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian Arab people.\n130.\tThat action has undoubtedly further complicated the problem. It has become evident that, the objective is not to realize an Israeli withdrawal from Sinai, but rather to liquidate the cause of the people of Palestine and to form a military alliance in the area built upon the debris of the Palestinian cause and at the expense of the national rights of the Arab nations and of the other occupied Arab territories.\n131.\tThe Camp David agreement and the Egyptian Israeli peace treaty have created a state of tension in the region. The magnitude of American military aid to Israel has exacerbated the situation because it has provided Israel with a huge military arsenal, which tempts Israel constantly to embark on new acts of aggression, of which the following are examples.\n132.\tFirst, there is the continuous aggression against Lebanon and the bombing and shelling of Lebanese towns and villages and Palestinian camps with a brutality unprecedented in human history. Israel has provided the climax to its brutal acts by bombing the peaceful city of Beirut, killing hundreds of civilians, destroying scores of houses and rendering thousands of citizens homeless.\n133.\tSecondly, the aggressive arrogance of the Israeli Government has even led it as far as to direct continuous threats against Syria, particularly against the Arab deterrent forces in Lebanon, and to fabricate the so-called Syrian missile crisis in Lebanon. Israeli planes have bombarded the positions of the Arab deterrent forces. When those forces resorted to the use of air defense weapons against those planes, Israel began issuing ultimatums to Syria to withdraw the air defense weapons from Lebanon. Israel believes it has the right to enjoy full freedom to commit acts of aggression wherever and whenever it so wishes. At the same ^me, Israel believes that we are not entitled to exercise our right of legitimate self-defense. We have naturally rejected this aggressive Israeli logic. Israel must bear the consequences of its aggressions.\n134., Thirdly, Israel's threats to the other Arab countries and their economic establishments have been carried out with the bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor,\n135. Fourthly, Israel persists in its policy of annexing the Arab territories, establishing settlements, evicting Arab citizens and altering the features of the occupied Arab territories, thus flouting world public opinion and totally disregarding the dangerous consequences of such a policy for peace and security in the region.\n136.\tWhile the Arab nations are confronting this situation which threatens their very existence and vital interests and imperils peace and stability in the region, the United States of America despite the considerable military and economic assistance it extends to Israel, and despite the military bases it has implanted in the region  has resorted to a new move which represents the climax of danger to the Arabs and their vital interests, as well as to the peace and security of the region. This move is the strategic alliance between the United States of America  the superPower and the Israeli State.\n137.\tA series of dangerous agreements has emerged from this alliance, namely: first, the establishment of military bases in Palestine; secondly, the storing of weapons, which naturally means stockpiling neutron weapons, after European Governments opposed this American decision; thirdly, setting up military industries in Israel; fourthly, achieving cooperation between the United States and Israeli security bodies, which means that all data collected by United States bodies and services, including those collected through satellites, will be placed at the disposal of the Israeli Government; fifthly, extending huge American military aid to Israel; and finally, linking United States strategic interests with the strategic interests of an aggressor State in the region.\n138.\tThese agreements were concluded with the aim of \\\"realizing strategic unanimity in the region against the Soviet Union and its supporters\\\". What does all this mean?\n139.\tIn the first place, these agreements have irrevocably frustrated the possibilities of peace in the region and the possibility of stability, security and tranquility throughout the whole Middle East. The United States is obliged to confront the Arabs because it agreed to link its strategic interests with those of Israel, completely disregarding the basic vital interests of the Arab people. In this policy, the United States administration has utilized its power in Israel's favor and placed itself in a position of enmity and hostility towards the Arabs.\n140.\tFurthermore, in reaction to this American involvement aimed at harming the Arab countries, the Arab world will be compelled to adopt measures and stands, the responsibility and repercussions of which on the regional and international situation will lie squarely on the United States itself.\n141.\tThere still exists for the United States the possibility to reconsider its policy and depart from this dangerous path which is harmful both to the Arabs and to the interests of the American people.\n142.\tHaving discussed the general situation in the region and its grave dangers, we call upon all peace, justice and freedom-loving nations to stand against the new alliance between the United States and Israel. At the same time the United Nations, by virtue of its responsibilities, is called upon to take measures against the Israeli aggressor. From this rostrum we also appeal to all Governments of the world to apply the maximum sanctions and measures against Israel because of its continued aggression, its refusal to recognize the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian Arab people and its refusal to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories.\n143.\tI can assure the Assembly that our people in Syria and the Arab nation will continue their struggle, irrespective of the sacrifices, for the recovery of their national and historical rights in Palestine and for the liberation of the occupied Arab territories.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " Sir, it is a particularly great privilege for me to have the opportunity to join with the eminent speakers who have preceded me in extending congratulations on your election to conduct the proceedings of this session. I am convinced that your recognized ability and experience as a politician and diplomat will fully guarantee successful results in our work. Likewise, I must express to the SecretaryGeneral our sincere appreciation for his self-less efforts for consistent achievement of the objectives and purposes of the United Nations.\n135.\tI wish to state from this rostrum the special satisfaction with which Equatorial Guinea greets the new States that have recently joined the great international community of free nations. I wish to refer especially to the Republic of Vanuatu, which recently became independent and was the one hundred and fifty-fifth Member admitted to the Organization, and Belize, which on 21 September acceded to national sovereignty and is today the one hundred and fifty-sixth Member of the United Nations. \n136.\tMy country, which considers that the independence of these two States strengthens the ranks of the countries of the third world in their struggle to bring about a more just and equitable world, is extremely pleased to extend its congratulations and its complete support to both Governments on the understanding that they will join all who are striving for peace and equal progress in respect and understanding for all the peoples of the world.\n137.\tWe are well aware that the present session is taking place at a time of crucial and decisive events created by the present crisis in international relations. This factual state of affairs requires, therefore, the adoption during this session of objective and concrete measures which can be implemented. Our concern is understandable, since the non-implementation of many of our resolutions on crucial and obviously serious situations leads to a lessening of the credibility and thus the effectiveness of the United Nations, which nevertheless remains the major source of hope for our States, particularly since the present world situation clearly shows that international peace and security have never been so seriously threatened. In the midst of such deterioration, it is obvious that the role of the United Nations must become a more effective one if we do not want to be helpless witnesses to a new world conflagration with consequences that would be as unpredictable for the human species as they would be deadly. In the opinion of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, the world situation imposes and requires a global view of problems. It is hardly realistic today to characterize and regionalize international tensions, since the' crisis affecting us is general and multifaceted. Accordingly, we believe that the time has come to review, not only within the Organization but also by the means available to each of our countries, the methods and procedures by which the present international crisis can best be resolved.\n138.\tThis new direction is all the more important in that the world scenario in which we act is increasingly complex, and a growing number of countries like the Republic of Equatorial Guinea see in the United Nations a secure, continuing and decisive guarantee of the maintenance of our national independence and an essential basis for the solution of international problems.\n139.\tWe wish to state that peace, security and the creation of more just and equitable international political relations are an inseparable part of the global policy being developed by the Government of the Supreme Military Council. Thus, the political philosophy of my Government is founded on adherence to the principle of the indivisible character of world peace. In its external policy, therefore, my Government fully shares and supports efforts designed to safeguard and consolidate world peace and security. Yet, we must recognize with regret that that peace and security will not be achieved as long as they are at the mercy of fear and distrust, the arms race among the Powers, the policy of spheres of influence and exacerbation of the cold war, nor can they be achieved as long as we do not succeed in replacing with dialog and negotiation the confrontation and wars that afflict thousands of human beings in various regions of our planet.\n140.\tMy Government views with deep concern the obstacles that exist to true disarmament that is both general and complete. In this connection, we advocate the effective implementation of United Nations resolutions on the non-nuclearization of the African continent, the Indian Ocean and other zones in the world.\n141.\tIn the course of the discussions during this sessions of the General Assembly we have listened with great relief on behalf of our nations and peoples to some statements by the principal nuclear Powers in which they have expressed their readiness and their conviction not only that United Nations resolutions on the limitation of nuclear weapons should be implemented, but that all means available to them should be employed to spare mankind from a possible nuclear tragedy.\n142.\tWe believe we speak on behalf of all countries whose primary concerns are the wellbeing and progress of their peoples when we say that we welcome such statements with a special hope, and we make an appeal that they should not remain mere political statements or expressions of good intentions on the part of those nations, but that reason and sanity will once and for all succeed where resolutions have failed. The world and mankind need this, for a nuclear war would not mean the victory of one country over another but the destruction of mankind by man himself-.\n143.\tWhen we speak of a better future for our children, we are faced with the contradictory question whether we shall be able to create a paradise among the flames.\n144.\tEquatorial Guinea looks with a feeling of impotence at the disconcerting future that looms before us, for it is true that we cannot speak of a peaceful future when human beings of our generation are scattered throughout the world seeking shelter. Palestine continues to be an illusion because no place exists for it as a country. Lebanon is fed by flames and reduced to ruins. Two other peoples, Iran and Iraq, are testing their warlike policies at the sacrifice of their populations, sowing their fields with the blood of their children. With a total absence of sanity, the Arab territories continue to be occupied, while Kampuchea and Afghanistan regress from freedom to slavery. In like manner, the world witnesses the problem of Korea. Equatorial Guinea hopes that in the not too distant future the parties concerned will find formulas that will bring about peaceful unification to their mutual benefit.\n145.\tWe advocate the freedom of peoples in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and yet our brothers in Namibia clamor for their freedom, sacrificing their children in their sacred mission for the redemption of their people. Today, Angola again suffers from the bombings and attacks that destroy its homes and its fields and render any progress impossible. The problem of skin pigmentation grows more serious with each day, vigorously intensified by discrimination and apartheid.\n146.\tThis is our children's inheritance. My country wonders whether this is due to the absence of practical and convincing solutions, or whether it is because such solutions are being distorted by the intransigence of some and the consent of others. The so-called great Powers have transformed the world into an arena for their own rivalries and covetousness and have made our peoples mere spectators. All of this is the result of what was denounced here a few days ago [5th meeting] by the leader of our brother country, Venezuela, Mr. Luis Herrera Campins, in his eloquent statement. In the face of this bitter truth, we are united in our opposition and condemnation in the conviction that the world belongs to man and that we are men, regardless of the color of our skin, origin, belief or social condition. We can and must fight against these adversities. We cannot expect peace to be maintained while our actions tend to make its existence impossible.\n147.\tThe delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea deems it fitting to recognize here the pertinence and importance of the statement read before the Assembly by that eminent statesman Mr. Herrera Campins, President of the Republic of Venezuela. The political content of his statement and the depth with which it reviewed the problems our world is experiencing, its careful review of economic problems and their causes and the dramatic appeal it contained for man to reconsider his ambitions and claims in favor of the safeguarding and security of the human species have prompted the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea formally to propose that the Assembly adopt that statement as a working document.\n148.\tIt will soon be 10 years since the world realized that there was a deterioration in economic cooperation among peoples. Accordingly, President Boumediene called in 1974 for a special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of considering an item entitled \\\"Study of the problem of raw materials and development'.' Since then we have been striving, as far as our means allow, to abolish the old international economic order based on the extreme domination and exploitation of some peoples by others and subsequently to establish and build up a new international political and economic order based on democracy, sovereign equality, national independence and multinational cooperation; we are striving for all such factors and principles which can ensure peaceful coexistence among countries and constitute active elements which would lead to the wellbeing of peoples by speeding up the economic and social progress of the developing countries. Yet we cannot conceal our disappointment at the fact that the opportunities for the developing countries to achieve their just claims and safeguard their legitimate rights become more remote daily.\n149.\tThe inequities in trade between the industrialized countries and the third world countries must cease. The industrialized Powers must also stop seeking to establish as accepted practice a trade with the third world which always benefits the former to the detriment of the latter.\n150.\tThe practice by the industrialized countries of paying little for our raw materials but seeking exorbitant prices for their manufactured goods is a premeditated brake on our development. The third world, as the sole owner, should impose the conditions of trade in its raw materials. It should determine the bases which would enable it freely to exercise control over its resources, free from outside pressure., It is a right to which the third world is not only entitled, but one for which it should fight, in order that it be accepted and recognized by the industrialized Powers. Such recognition would be a major contribution to the establishment of an adequate platform for the success of the NorthSouth dialog.\n151.\tWe advocate closer trade links among third world countries, as well as the establishment of adequate regional economic and financial institutions and organizations which will promote our trade and provide us with the structures we need in order to impose our conditions on our own materials. That is necessary in the face of a world deteriorating through inflation and economic instability brought about by the industrialized countries. Accordingly we aspire to a more rational and effective economic cooperation which will benefit all our peoples.\n152.\tThis session is being held only a month after the celebration by the people of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, in a climate of freedom, peace, tranquility and social order, of the second anniversary of the historic date of 3 August 1979. Since then the valuable assistance and growing solidarity of the international community with our country have been, among other things, one of the most eloquent expressions not only of recognition of the tragic situation which we inherited but, furthermore, of acknowledgment of the firmness and sincerity with which the Government of the Supreme Military Council has undertaken the difficult task of national reconstruction in order progressively to lessen the sufferings of our people. Two years of self-less labor and sacrifices have sufficed to confirm our full conviction that the just undertaking that we have embarked upon in building a better Guinea requires the active and sincere participation of all our citizens at every stage, as well as the assistance of the international community. We can congratulate ourselves at having consolidated, during, that relatively short period, the bases for the gradual and consistent realization of our programmed objectives of recovery and reorganization of the State in all fields.\n153.\tWe are realistically following a policy of peace, tranquility, order and justice. Truly, and despite the natural difficulties involved in a task of this magnitude and scope, no one can doubt that today one of the main achievements of our Government has been the establishment of full observance of respect for human rights in the present society of Equatorial Guinea. On repeated occasions we have stated that respect for fundamental human rights is one of the pillars of our Government's policy, a position which we have invariably advocated in international forums. We have therefore actively cooperated with the United Nations and humanitarian institutions which have shown an interest in human rights in our country. Through such action we are seeking the recovery of the moral values of our people, and therefore we restored their individual and collective freedoms and guarantees, making social justice another basic principle guiding our policy. We are striving to improve the social life of our people with the material and spiritual means available to us, and we can say that the results achieved are there for all to see. We are fully committed to continue improving our system until we bring about the desired national unity, concord and reconciliation.\n154.\tNevertheless, there are isolated elements and sectors which, prompted by selfish and personal ambitions, seek to distort our action by a campaign of slander and lies. Our people realize that that campaign is intended to confuse international public opinion concerning the real facts about our country today, so as not only to demoralize our people in their struggle for peace, justice and national reconciliation, but also to incite and revive partisan, tribal and regional ideals which, among other negative factors, gave rise to the political tragedy which we experienced during the last decade. To try to ignore those facts would, in our opinion, be tantamount to wishing to return Equatorial Guinea to the tragic circumstances which led to its destruction.\n155.\tChief among the main guiding principles of the political action of Government of the Supreme Military Council is its unswerving determination to achieve a just society based on national reconciliation. For us, national reconciliation and social integration constitute one of the bases of the national reconstruction which we have undertaken. Our situation today, as the heirs to a devastated country, requires gigantic efforts in every field. The reconstruction of our economy on firm bases is the problem we now face. We wish to effect radical changes in the present single-crop system, diversifying agriculture so as to achieve self-sufficiency for our population and expanding our activities in the fields of livestock, industry, fishing and other sectors of production so as to relaunch our national economy.\n156.\tWe can indeed affirm that at every step our Government is translating its vast political, economic and social program into concrete works and achievements. We have always affirmed that the historic decision of the armed forces to save the country on 3 August 1979 was not due to a desire for power, but was an effective response to the solemn appeal and cry of alarm of our people which were then being martyred. Since then the armed forces have taken over the management of the State and the responsibility for undertaking a genuine process of bringing democracy to the country, a process which is not the result of improvisations likely to return our people to their previous condition.\n157.\tObviously, any objectively set course in this process of democratization should not be radically dissociated from the indigenous mental character of our national ethnic groups in so far as their traditional forms of organized life are concerned, although neither can we avoid our commitment to modern times. Hence, we advocate the imperative need for Equatorial Guinea to harmonize the social values of our indigenous traditions with modern forms of democracy. We are in favor of importing technological resources which will contribute to our development; yet our people, which has a wealth of deeply rooted traditions and customs, could not conceive of the import of political and ideological formulas which attempt to destroy it once again. In that respect, and on the occasion of the second anniversary of the blow for freedom, celebrated in the city of Bata, the President of the Supreme Military Council of Equatorial Guinea, Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, declared:\n\\\"Following the guidelines designating the historical responsibility assumed on 3 August 1979 to democratize the country, and contrary to the false statements and concerns of some anachronistic pseudo-politicians, the Government of the Supreme Military Council, in fulfillment of its unswerving commitment adopted before the people and international public opinion, formally and solemnly declares in this act that, in the third year of its mandate, which begins tomorrow, 3 August, it will convene a popular referendum to submit a national political constitution to consultation with the people of Equatorial Guinea for their approval or rejection, on a date to be made known in due time.\\\"\n158.\tWhat is more, my Government, with the firmness and sincerity that characterize its action, has enacted the Organic DecreeLaw, of a constitutional nature, number 1/1981, of 2 May, on the government and Administration of settlements in Equatorial Guinea, which without doubt constitutes a remarkable step towards the overall democratization of our country. In so doing, we are convinced that without the people and its lesser government entities, our democratization process could not attain maturity. As we see it. the political, economic and social development of the rural areas which constitute our settlements is the basis for national development towards more effective democratization, because we wish to develop our action firmly within the objectives and the ideals of peace, freedom, order and respect for the fundamental rights of peoples and men.\n159. Parallel with that action which we are carrying out internally, the two years of the existence of the Government of the Supreme Military Council have enabled us to express our optimism about the results achieved in our international policy by broadening and strengthening our relations of friendship and cooperation with all countries of the world on a basis of equality and mutual respect. We are pleased to note the vast improvement in our coexistence with neighboring countries, as well as in our relations with the other countries of the continent within the OAU.\n160.\tIn that context, special mention should be made of the excellent relations of all-round and fruitful cooperation which we have maintained in the two years of the Government of the Supreme Military Council with the Kingdom of Spain, to which we are united by ties of history and culture.\n161.\tOur political philosophy of AfroIberoAmericanism takes shape at every step through the fruitful contacts we have established with the brother States of Latin America, which foreshadow a promising future in our relations of friendship and cooperation.\n162.\tWith growing interest, the organizations of the United Nations system, international financial institutions and other humanitarian bodies have unceasingly encouraged us through their valuable assistance. One result of that cooperation is the holding of the forthcoming conference of donors of aid for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Equatorial Guinea under the sponsorship of UNDP. We invite all countries and organizations desirous of helping us in our work of national reconstruction to attend that conference.\n163.\tMy delegation is fully convinced that the General Assembly at its present session will create new conditions that will make it possible to strengthen the role of the United Nations in its sacred mission of safeguarding the maintenance of international peace and security and of promoting fruitful cooperation among nations.\n"

        "file_text": "134.\t The delegation of Bolivia congratulates Mr, Kittani on his election to the high post of the presidency of the thirty-sixth session. His personal qualities and his broad professional experience guarantee objective leadership and . success for our debates.\n135.\tWe also wish to thank Mr. von Wechmar for his outstanding work and in particular for his contribution to the preparatory work for global negotiations, a central issue for the new expectations of the world.\n136.\tWe wish to express particular gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts to bring about international peace and security.\n137.\tBolivia, a signatory of the. Charter at San Francisco, offers a fraternal welcome to the two youngest Member States of the Organization, Vanuatu and Belize.\n138.\tIn the past year the world situation has visibly deteriorated. The number of victims of war, exodus, hunger, terrorism and fanatic violence is increasing day by day in the vast areas of the world in which there are conflicts. The tensions between the major blocs are becoming more acute and are making international security more precarious. Consequently in all its aspects the arms race is accelerating and is consuming resources that are needed for the economic, social and.cultural development of peoples.\n139.\tAs is the case with endeavors to bring about peace, many efforts to bring about justice have been thwarted, and neither the will of the General Assembly nor the agreement of the Security Council, so often obstructed by vetoes, have managed to enforce the fundamental principles of the Charter. Contrary to the firm majority decision of the international community, there continue to exist certain unacceptable attitudes of racial discrimination, warlike aggression, domination and colonialist plunder, occupation of territories by force, and new and sinister forms of fanaticism.\n140.\tThroughout its history Bolivia has learned the painful lessons of aggression and injustice, and we would once again repeat our adherence to the inviolable principles of sovereignty, independence, self-determination, non-intervention and the territorial integrity of States.\n141.\tAs part of this clear foreign policy of Bolivia we would express our support for the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, and in particular for the liberation of the occupied Arab territories. The inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories through force of arms is a substantive part of Bolivia's foreign policy.\n142.\tWe accept that Israel has the unquestionable right to live within secure and recognized boundaries.\n143.\tWe deplore the tragedy in Lebanon, and who feel that it is the duty of the States of the area to respect the neutrality and sovereignty of that nation.\n144.\tWe condemn the occupation, of Afghanistan, ,the presence, of invading troops in Kampuchea and the illegal colonial domination in Namibia..\n145.\tWe consider it indispensable for South Korea and North Korea to resolve their differences by means of direct dialog, with the cooperation of the Secretary-General\n146.\tFinally, we reiterate Bolivia's unswerving position of support for Argentina's just demand regarding the Malvinas Islands.\n147.\tIn addition to these disruptions in the area of justice and peace, there exists a serious delay hi efforts to bring about a new international economic order and, in particular, in initiating the global negotiations which might make it possible for us to co-ordinate international efforts in the areas of the economy and development, introducing the criterion of change. For change is essential and cannot be postponed, since hunger, ignorance and the frustration of the people only encourage subversion and violence. There is no need to stress the moral legitimacy of these goals, because underlying all conflicts in our time there may be found a growing dislocation: the prosperity and power of, the wealthy communities and in contrast the stagnation, poverty, and impotence of the third word. \n148.\tWe believe that the global negotiations, which have been held up by procedural details, must begin as soon as - possible. South-South co-operation, which has been admirably planned and carried out by the Group of 77, must move towards the goal of self-sufficiency, which is complementary to North-South understanding. In this area we must also accept the need to conclude regional agreements to develop and market our natural resources in a just and rational manner, in order to bring us the legitimate profits that will make it possible for us to meet the needs of social development ourselves..\t'\n149.\tLet us say this once again: the existing International economic order is based on colonial and neo-colonial exploitation which has been condemned by history. There are still those who wish to perpetuate this, but it is clear that if peace is to be achieved in the world there must first be justice, and we consider that a new international economic order must preside over the relations among all States of the world. In this context protectionism must be eliminated, as Well as the practices of \\\"dumping\\\", by which some developed countries use noncommercial reserves to bring about an artificial collapse in the prices of certain commodities. That happens periodically to Bolivia with regard to tin.\n150.\tIn this year when we arc commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the non-aligned movement, Bolivia reaffirms its faith in the concept of non-alignment. We have a position of principle that requires independence of the great blocs of the world. We respect ideological pluralism and the requirements of economic interdependence. We stand with all developing countries and we find in non-alignment a powerful, valid resource to pursue the third world's struggle for world peace and improved living conditions.\n151.\tWe regret that the long, prolific debates that were supposed to lead to an International agreement on the new law of the sea were paralyzed precisely when they were about to be concluded. We hope that those who justify this l>y referring to passing difficulties will see that it is in theft best interests to work in this direction, for this agreement Is of universal value. The sea, like the other great bounties of nature and like freedom and well-being, is the common heritage of all people, and of all mankind.\n152.\tThe Government of Bolivia is profoundly concerned over and protests against all forms of terrorism. No goal, no matter how noble it may be, justifies this crime in which repressed sectarian passions find almost daily expression. The Holy Ruler in Rome, even the President of the United States in the capital of that great country, and many other distinguished or anonymous human beings have been victims of reprehensible attempts on their lives. And now we must lament the passing of the illustrious President of Egypt, Anwar El Sadat, a real man of peace in the Middle East, the distinguished leader of his people, who has fallen under murderous bullets.\n153.\tBolivia feels that the struggle against terrorism must be confirmed and co-ordinated at a level as high as that for disarmament, for this is a kind of spiritual disarmament required by public order and by civilized society.\n154.\t\\\"For us, America is the homeland\\\", as Bolivar the Liberator said. This has always been in the minds of the people who bear his name and has determined our complete support for the process of Latin American integration. Considering the common nature of our problems and our hopes, the vastness of our territory, the broad range and abundance ,of natural resources, the rapid growth of the population, and our need to overcome cultural, economic and social deficiencies which still beset us, integration will indubitably be a difficult undertaking. None of our nations, not even any of the greater ones, can carry out its complete; development plan without inter-American co-operation.\n155.\tBolivia is situated geographically in the heart of South America and at the crossroads of the history of the continent. It has an important role to play in Latin American integration, and we have been playing this role In good faith because it is our calling.\n156.\tOur country is in the watershed of the Amazon and the Plate and near to the South Pacific. Bolivia has therefore been a land of contacts and has bad a decisive influence on the geopolitical balance of our continent.\n157.\tIn keeping with its integrationist tradition, Bolivia has actively participated in the Latin American Integration Association, the Andean Pact, the TVeaty for Amazonian Co-operation, the Heaty of the River Plate Basin, the Convention signed by Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia and other agreements of the same kind. Obviously, agreements governing regional and sub-regional integration, negotiated in the light of the development needs of our peoples, must not be subject to Ideological deviations which contradict the principles of pluralism and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, so necessary to proper\nInternational coexistence. Just as the conscience of the world Is concerned about the protection of human rights, so is it necessary for the international community to pay attention to the rights of nations which have been violated by historic Injustices,\n158.\tIn this lofty forum we would once again refer to Bolivia's land-locked status which has existed for more than a century. We appeal for international solidarity to encourage the peaceful solution of our problems, in keeping with the inalienable and imprescriptible right of the Republic of Bolivia to regain its coastline. This unjust situation continues with all the grave spiritual and material consequences for our people; it has perpetuated a state of tension in the area which one day could undermine peace and security in America.\n159.\tBolivia's demand to recover its outlet to the Pacific, with sovereignty and geographic continuity and without territorial compensation, has won considerable support, including the support of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States at its ninth regular session. I take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Government and people of Bolivia of these permanent expressions of solidarity by Governments and international organizations with the maritime cause of our country.\n160.'\tWe now wish to report to this Assembly on certain aspects of the problems which relate to Bolivia's internal situation. In the first place, Bolivians believe in the inherent values of freedom, dignity, solidarity and justice. We desire to organize a new society, with participation by all, a pluralist society where democracy is accepted not only In its formal political sense of elections, but also with its fundamental economic and social content and as a way of life.\n161.\tThe land-locked status of our country has hampered its process of development. For this main reason, and for other more incidental reasons, we have economic and financial problems which have caused social discontent, and this in turn has led to political unrest. More recently, we have witnessed certain institutional problems which, thanks to the calmness and patriotism of the aimed forces and the proved maturity of our people, have been dealt with without bloodshed.\n162.\tA firm and respected Government rules national life. Public order reigns In Bolivia, and work is guaranteed as a right. Wc consider the people, the Bolivian citizen, as a protagonist of history and of our national life. We believe that nothing is more precious than the human capital of a nation. Therefore, all the business of the State and its growth policy for the economy is directed to promoting the well-being of its people and to the full development of the human personality.\n163.\tIn the program for this great political plan with its predominantly social content the Bolivian workers in the fields, the mines and the cities occupy the preferred place. Both public freedom and fundamental human rights are respected in Bolivia, where there are now no political prisoners. Soon a special envoy from the United Nations will visit our country at the spontaneous request of our Government to confirm that we have a climate of freedom, peace and security in which Bolivians can carry out their activities. I wish to announce on behalf of my Government that within three years institutional democracy will be re-established in our country.\n164.\tIn defense of the morality of our people and In support of the universal desire to eliminate illicit drug traffic, our Government is now undertaking the difficult. but Irrevocable task of combating and eliminating the clandestine production of narcotics and the illicit traffic, In addition to adopting strict police and customs controls, the Government of Bolivia has adopted a number of other important provisions, including the creation of the National Council to Combat the Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, the establishment of a government monopoly to control the legal trade in coca leaves, the carrying out of a census of coca-leaf production with a view to crop replacement and a study of new legislation to suppress the production of, traffic in and consumption of the drug.\n165.\tAs we progress with this task the serious nature of the problem becomes clearer, and so does the impossibility of dealing with it without international co-operation. We have accordingly suggested to the United Nations the desirability of joint action and have succeeded in having an item included in the agenda of this session entitled \\\"International campaign against traffic in drugs\\\". We can give no clearer evidence of our intention to contribute to the elimination of this world problem and at the same time of the need to receive from the Organization and from Member States, through bilateral agreements, adequate and speedy financial and technical co-operation.\n166.\tThe Bolivian proposal is in the hands of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. We pledge our constant efforts, and we also suggest to the industrialized countries, where the major cities provide the demand for drugs and where society is most seriously affects J by this vice, that there is an urgent need for a substantial contribution from them in support of the aims of this great effort of redemption.\n167.\tIt is in a spirit of truthfulness that we have enumerated some of the frustrations of the Organization, but we wish to draw from these negative comments the affirmative conclusion that, however complex the problems may be, it is our duty to persist in our search for solutions within the United Nations in keeping with the norms of the Charter\n168.\tBolivia, a land-locked nation, reiterates its confidence in justice, its faith in the world Organization and its certainty that the evils of war, poverty and discrimination will one day be eradicated through the spiritual force that aids us: universal solidarity, the foundation of our hopes for progress and peace.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, your assumption of the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is, for Tunisia, a source of satisfaction as well as proof of esteem and confidence: esteem for your qualities as a statesman and an experienced diplomat, and confidence in your ability to conduct successfully the work of this session, the importance of which, owing to the particularly delicate world situation, calls for all the wisdom and courage of which we know you to.be capable.\n88.\tIn extending to you our warm and fraternal congratulations, the Tunisian delegation wishes to assure you that it will spare no effort to give you its full support and wholehearted cooperation as you discharge your important and arduous responsibilities. We shall do this all the more enthusiastically because you represent a fraternal Arab country, Iraq, with which Tunisia maintains the closest and most fruitful of relations both bilaterally and in the framework of the United Nations and the various regional organizations in which our two fraternal countries work side by side.\n89.\tThe Tunisian delegation would also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar. We shall long remember here the skillful, objective and efficient way in which he conducted both the thirty-fifth session and the eighth emergency special session. Our wishes for success go with him in his new functions.\n90.\tMy delegation also wishes to pay the same warm and sincere tribute to the SecretaryGeneral for the remarkable work, praiseworthy from all standpoints, that he has carried out in his 10 years of service to the United Nations in defenseF of the principles of our Charter.\n91.\tAt the Security Council meetings of 8 July and 23 September 1981, the Tunisian delegation expressed its great pleasure at welcoming Vanuatu and Belize to the Organization. We are pleased today to see them occupying their rightful seats in the Assembly. We wish to take this opportunity out again to bid our two new Member States a very warm welcome and to renew our warm congratulations to their respective delegations and assure them of our full cooperation.\n92.\tI should also like to address Tunisia's greetings to all the peoples of the world represented here, and to reaffirm my country's determination to continue to spare no effort in the fulfillment of the principles underlying the Organization.\n93.\tSuffice it for me to mention here the vigorous and resolute action of the Government of President Bourguiba to promote the betterment of the individual, to establish true democracy in my country with due expression of political freedom, social justice and economic progress, and, externally, to promote with friendly and fraternal countries, in the framework of the broadest cooperation, action based on understanding and dialog.\n94.\tThose principles, to the implementation of which the Tunisia of President Bourguiba is resolutely committed, do not appear, unfortunately, to have been strictly applied everywhere in international relations.\n95.\tIn the year that has passed since the last session of the Assembly, we have seen no notable progress in the development of the international situation. In fact, the tensions that confronted us are now more disturbing and more dangerous, and the problems we have tried to tackle remain unresolved and have become even more complex.\n96.\tThe Security Council, the supreme organ of the Organization, has certainly deliberated, practically throughout the year, on all the grave questions which represented a threat to international peace and security. We cannot but note, however, that the results of those deliberations have often led to disappointment and have increased the frustration of those who have addressed themselves to this supreme body, confident of their rights and motivated only by their faith in the principles of the Charter.\n97.\tWhether it be for decolonization in Africa or the Middle East, racism and apartheid, the tight of peoples freely to choose their own system of government, nonintervention in the internal affairs of States, or regional conflicts throughout the world, the record unfortunately still remains a very poor one.\n98.\tHence the particular importance we attach to the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly, of which it is the imperative duty to change the dangerous course taken hitherto by events, to reconcile men with principles and the ideals of peace and progress, and to arouse new hope for the good of the whole of mankind.\n99.\tMore than 21 years after the adoption by the Organization of resolution 1514 (XV) containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, at a time when we are already within sight of the end of the century, we must put an end firmly and with determination to the anachronistic, intolerable situation which still prevails in Palestine and in Namibia. We cannot disregard the valiant struggle being waged by the peoples of Palestine and Namibia under the leadership of their legitimate representatives, the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] and the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], and fail to recognize their inalienable rights to freedom, justice, self-determination and independence.\n100.\tIt is high time to put an end to the inadmissible attitude of provocation and defiance in which, in total equanimity, I would stress, the regimes of Tel Aviv and Pretoria are engaging. These two regimes of oppression, racism and Zionism, no doubt exchanging the best tried recipes, are oppressing ever more ferociously with each passing day the peoples of Namibia, South Africa and Palestine and vying with each other in acts of aggression against the peoples of southern Africa and the Middle East flagrant acts of aggression, repeated acts of aggression, but always with impunity, unfortunately. The field of these acts of aggression is becoming ever broader and is extending to Angola, Mozambique, Lebanon or Iraq, sovereign Member States of the community of nations.\n101.\tAnd here we have the two of them, priding themselves on acting as spearheads of some kind of defense strategy for an order or civilization to which they have no claim to belong.\n102.\tBut apart from that aspect, the situation in the Middle East and in southern Africa today contains more than ever before risks of explosion and conflict which threatens the balance in the world.\n103.\tIn the Middle East military operations conducted by the Israeli army against the Palestinians and against the people of Lebanon have created one of the most dangerous situations that have existed since 1973. Those who thought that the Camp David agreements would have the effect of providing momentum for the peace process in the area today have had to face the facts. We cannot but note that those agreements have been exploited by Tel Aviv in order freely to conduct its strategy aimed at eliminating the Palestinians. Since that time, the war waged against the Palestinians has assumed impressive dimensions, involving both the air force and the navy, as well as the army.\n104.\tIt is the implementation of that strategy which today continues the major obstacle to the establishment of lasting peace in the area. So the obstinate refusal of Israel to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, its total scorn for the many resolutions of the United Nations and for international public opinion, have brought the problem of the Middle East to an impasse. Arrogance, aggressiveness, expansionism: these are three outstanding features of the attitude of Israel in the face of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to a State.\n105.\tTunisia, which supports unreservedly the just cause of the Palestinian people, reaffirms its conviction that there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East without a comprehensive settlement which would take account first of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment under the aegis of its sole legitimate representative, the PLO of an independent state, and of the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories, including AlQuds.\n106.\tIsrael, using the pretext of security, wishes both to ensure its own military supremacy in the area and to annex Arab territories. It is precisely this expansionist policy that is today the main cause of insecurity and that almost led to a new war in the Middle East following the affair of the Syrian missiles which were, incidentally, purely defensive devices.\n107.\tSecurity is an urgent need for all the peoples of the area. It is imperative for their stability and their development. Thus, it cannot be seen in terms of the military supremacy of one State over all the others, which would push the latter into intense rearmament and into various alliances in order to oppose the hegemony of that State, its adventurist policy and its irresponsibility the dangers of which we see in Lebanon, and of which the raid on the nuclear plant at Tamuz is the most illuminating example.\n108.\tThis premeditated act of war, unanimously condemned by the international community, constitutes a dangerous precedent which jeopardizes not only the IAEA system of guarantees, but also the rules of international conduct which govern the civilized world.\n109.\tPeace in the Middle East is a vital necessity for all the peoples of the region. Several Arab countries have made concrete and positive proposals for the establishment of a just and lasting peace, based on consensus but rejecting expansionism, exclusivity and domination. It is urgent to begin without delay the exploration of new avenues to break the deadlock in the situation and embark on a process of true peace in that very sensitive part of the world.\n110.\tThat process should first, if it is not to fail, involve the PLO in all stages of negotiations. The PLO, which has constantly given proof of its realism, its sense of responsibility and its capacity to honor its commitments, has today come to be the only negotiating partner capable of speaking on behalf of the Palestinian people. It is therefore time to admit that fact unreservedly.\n111.\tIt is also in the respect for international legality and the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Organization that we find the solution to the painful and explosive problem of Namibia. The present impasse jeopardizes the peace, security and development of the whole of southern Africa.\n112.\tAfter the failure of the Geneva Conference owing to the recalcitrance and provocative attitude of South Africa, the debate in the Security Council in April 1981 and that at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly last September have revealed the limits that we could reasonably impose on the legendary patience of Africa, and of the Namibian people and its authentic representative, SWAPO.\n113.\tThe keen sense of realism and responsibility displayed by SWAPO in its struggle for the recognition of its right to self-determination and independence is matched only by its determination to bring about the independence of its people by means of negotiation and dialog, or by any other means.\n114.\tIn accordance with the resolution adopted by the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly [resolution ES8/2], Tunisia is firmly in favor of the immediate, unconditional and unreserved application, without reservation or modification, of the plan advocated in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), and reaffirmed by the United Nations as a whole, to put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia and to bring that Territory to independence.\n115.\tIn so doing, we shall have made our deeds match our words and our principles match the facts.\n116.\tTunisia cannot conceal its surprise at the tolerant attitude which, in the name of a solidarity of principle, has been taken by the Western world towards South Africa and Israel about their violations of the principles of the Charter and their defiance of the United Nations. It is by its contribution to the fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of the oppressed peoples in Namibia and Palestine that the Western world will give convincing proof of the sincerity of its support for just causes and will demonstrate its genuine interest in Africa and the Arab world.\n117.\tHow much longer are we going to tolerate the people of South Africa being subjected to inhuman and barbarous laws, racist and segregationist laws which are enforced by the apartheid regime with impunity and with the toleration of others?\n118.\tHow much longer must we tolerate interference in the internal affairs of States and the presence in independent territories of foreign troops, the deployment of which prevents those peoples from freely choosing the form and system of their government? How long are we going to tolerate the massive and flagrant foreign military presence in Afghanistan and Kampuchea?\n119.\tWhen are the parties concerned, whether it be in Afghanistan, Kampuchea or even in Korea, going to decide in favor of dialog and negotiation and to spare their peoples the horrors of war and the torments of division?\n120.\tWill the repeated appeals, made particularly by the Islamic countries, calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan ever be heeded?\n121.\tWill the appeals endorsed by the International Conference on Kampuchea, held last July, make it possible to restore dialog so that the people of Kampuchea will be allowed to know peace and prosperity?\n122.\tWill the appeals of South Korea for dialog and work towards understanding with North Korea be heeded and will they enable us to see the people of Korea making an effective contribution to the work of the Organization, whether that be through a single representation or, if not, separate representations, on the basis of existing precedents?\n123.\tWhen will we see the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral, those of the Organization of the Islamic Conference or the nonaligned movement which this year is celebrating its twentieth anniversary and of which'Tunisia is honored to be one of the founder members succeed in putting an end to the war that still continues in the Middle East between two fraternal and neighboring countries, Iraq and Iran, which are surely meant to live in peace and cooperation? We have pointed but that one of the parties, Iraq, has made peace offers and appeals for negotiation. Will it be possible to take this opportunity to embark on a process that will permit a settlement of this distressing conflict? Will the parties involved resolve to give up a sterile struggle which can only prolong unnecessarily the suffering and devastation of the region and make even more remote the prospects of restoring peace and stability in the area?\n124.\tCourage and heroism certainly have their merits. So have diplomacy and wisdom, and their merits are far superior in most cases. As evidence of this I shall give an example very close to my own country, that of Western Sahara, which after a long period of tension and conflict has, thanks to the clear sightedness and courage of the Maghreb leaders, under the auspices of the OAU and within the framework of African wisdom, just taken a decisive step towards the establishment of peace and stability.\n125.\tIt is time for relations between States, whether they be large or small, to be based on mutual respect, and for differences in social or economic systems not to be allowed to be a source of conflict. It is time for every State to be able to organize its national structures in terms of its own realities and to define freely its policies, without having to fear encountering the interference of other States. This is what has come to be known as peaceful coexistence, which should have led to authentic detente; but, I am afraid, this is something which today we have come to see as belonging to the past. The hardening of situations to which we are now witness in international relations seems destined to bring about a reemergence in a new form of the cold war, which will once again give priority to problems of security, defense and armament, to the detriment of the objectives of peace and development. This atmosphere fraught with threats makes it difficult seriously to contemplate large-scale disarmament measures. On the contrary, we can see that the pace of the arms race particularly competition in the realm of nuclear weapons is becoming even fester; it constitutes not only a constant danger to mankind's survival but also a terrible waste of vital human and other resources. The need for maintaining dialog, for resuming constructive negotiations, for eliminating the causes of mistrust that underlie the arms race is today more necessary than ever. The second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, scheduled for next spring, will give us an excellent opportunity, one which we must not fail to seize, because without any doubt peace is mankind's most precious asset.\n126.\tMajor questions which have aroused the interest and hopes of the international community, which were on the point of being resolved and which have been the subject of long and arduous deliberations at regular sessions of the General Assembly, at special sessions and at ad hoc international conferences have come up against an obstructive attitude, which in its turn has given rise to questioning and concern.\n127.\tSuch questioning and concern have arisen with regard to the fulfillment of the international desire to define the law, such as the law of the sea and the laws determining NorthSouth cooperation, upon which depends to such a large extent the future of the whole international community.\n128.\tThe world economic situation continues to give the international community grounds for grave concern. Nothing, indeed, in the past year has happened to modify in any way the alarming trends which we have constantly deplored for many years. Some of those trends have even been aggravated. The developed countries continue to struggle with their own structural and economic problems. Inflationary tension in some of those countries, the economic slowdown in others, the ever more visible differences in the perception of the scope of these two phenomena and the solution which should be applied to them have brought those countries to an almost chaotic state, frequently as a result of contradictory economic policies. The problem of interest rates, the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, the rise of protectionism, the persistence and, in certain cases the exacerbation of high rates of unemployment, are all negative results of these policies.\n129.\tOf course, the developing countries suffer the cumulative consequences of these policies, which are reflected particularly in their balances of trade, which for the most part are becoming increasingly unbalanced, and in the level of their indebtedness, often verging on the intolerable. Payment difficulties created in this way are accentuated even more by the reduction of public bilateral aid from certain developed countries, and by no means the least important countries, as well as by the many restrictions facing multilateral financing and technical assistance institutions, including the World Bank and UNDP, in adequately replenishing their resources. This situation proves once again that the developed countries have no hesitation in transferring the costs of their own adaptation to the economic situation to the developing countries, which, because of the weakness of their economic structures, are forced to curb their expansion, if not halt it altogether, thus doing damage to the economic and social development of their peoples.\n130.\tThe third world countries in general recognize the increasingly tangible fact of the interdependence of countries and economic problems, but it is not at all realistic to ask them to wait patiently for a solution of the chronic problems of the industrialized countries before they can develop their own economies.\n131.\tWith a view to the establishment of international economic relations on solid and equitable foundations in the interests of the parties concerned, the third world has for many years now been proposing the fundamental restructuring of these relations by the establishment of a new international economic order. This objective, in spite of the difficulties it has encountered, remains more valid than ever, because it is the only one which could promote a balanced and harmonious development of the world economy by reducing the ever-widening economic gap between rich and poor countries.\n132.\tThe project of launching global negotiations obviously stems from the same line of thought. These negotiations should not, of course, reduce to nothing the achievements, however limited they may be, obtained through efforts undertaken for so many years now in various international forums, and most recently at the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, which has just been held at Nairobi and at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, just held at Paris. But we should also try to fill gaps and go forward, bearing in mind both the short-term and longterm interests of the international community as a whole and the developing countries in particular.\n133.\tIs there any need to stress that development depends to a large measure on science and technology? This aspect was dealt with at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, held at Vienna from 20 to 31 August 1979, at which a program of Action was drawn up.6 The results, however, remain very limited, hence the need for strengthening the scientific and technological capacity within the developing countries because without that the transfer of technology to those countries can constitute only a very uncertain contribution to the work of development. This approach calls for increasing internal effort on the part of the developing countries, greater horizontal cooperation among them and a more determined contribution from the rest of the international community.\n134.\tAware of this need, a number of countries, including Tunisia, have embarked on consultations in order to educate all the parties concerned as to their role in this matter. We believe that this initiative is a useful supplement to the action undertaken in the United Nations. Success in this can only have a positive effect on efforts which will be undertaken at this session of the General\nAssembly to produce an agreement on a system of financing for science and technology.\n135.\tThe third world, for its part, has already shown its firm determination to come to the next stage of the North South dialog in a constructive spirit, convinced of its rights and duties and the action made possible by its unity, which has just been strengthened by the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries held at Caracas last May. The third world countries are, above all, convinced that the developed world can no longer ignore the role which they play in the maintenance of its own prosperity. It is therefore in the interest of all for the developing countries to remain solvent and for them to develop unhindered, so that they can become genuine partners of the industrialized countries.\n136.\tThe deadlock in the process of launching global negotiations and the delay in concluding the work of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea are particularly worrying and disturbing.\n137.\tWe venture to hope that those responsible for this situation will soon be able to conclude the period of reflection which they have allowed themselVes and share once again the general will to conclude work on the draft convention on the law of the sea and to embark on global negotiations.\n138.\tIn this respect, we are glad to see this general consensus strengthened by the open and unreserved support which we have noted in the statement to the Assembly by the representative of France [9th meeting] and also by the particularly encouraging and positive change of attitude on the part of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n139.\tThe International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, which is to be held at Cancun in the next few days, will give us an opportunity to see whether our hopes are well founded and whether the wish of those who want to make progress will prevail, so as to provide genuine momentum for global negotiations, the natural forum for which obviously remains the United Nations. The concerted action of all States Members of the Organization in order to provide further momentum for the NorthSouth dialog is necessary not only for economic reasons but also and above all for preeminently political reasons.\n140.\tThe stakes are high and far transcend the immediate interests of any of the partners in this common enterprise. I .hope we can all realize this.\n141.\tThere is nothing about the international situation to encourage optimism. However, we must not allow ourselves to fall prey to doubt, resignation or despair.\n142.\tIt is indeed dangerous to allow the spiral of tension to go on increasing. The peoples of the third world are refusing ta remain pawns in the game of greatPower rivalry, in markets for raw materials and in outlets for manufactured products. They are determined to achieve their status as fully-fledged partners in the concert of nations.\n143.\tWith regard to their security and their development that is to say, their very destiny they have every intention of assuming this role fully, freely and democratically.\n"

        "file_text": "226.\t On behalf of the delegation of Bhutan, I should like to offer our warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the thirty- sixth session of the General Assembly. With your long and intimate personal association with the United Nations, both as representative of your country and as an official of the Secretariat, you are eminently suited to guide the deliberations of this august body. We wish you, and the other members of the General Committee, all success in your endeavors during the busy and difficult period that lies ahead.\n227.\tMy delegation has great pleasure in welcoming Vanuatu and Belize as the two newest Members of the United Nations. The admission of every new Member adds to the vitality and vigour of the Organization, and also takes us one step closer to attaining complete universality of membership, a goal we all earnestly desire.\n228.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the SecretaryGeneral for the able and dedicated manner in which he has consistently endeavored to promote the manifold objectives of the Organization. We are indeed fortunate to have such a distinguished personality at the helm of our affairs at a critical juncture in international relations.\n229.\tThe present global scene is not a happy one. The cardinal principles of noninterference and nonintervention in the affairs of sovereign States which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations continue to be violated in many cases. The use. of force has been glaringly resorted to in some cases as a justified means of attaining political objectives.\n230.\tAs we have stated repeatedly in the past in this and other forums, we are opposed to interference and intervention in the affairs of sovereign States and the threat or use of force in international relations. We are therefore, purely as a matter of principle, fully committed to the view that foreign troops in South Asia and SouthEast Asia must be withdrawn, and the independent, nonaligned status of the countries concerned restored.\n231.\tMy delegation had hoped to see seated amongst us at this session the representatives of a free and independent Namibia, occupying its rightful place in the comity of nations. However, in spite of resolute attempts made during the course of the year by the international community, Security Council resolution 435 (1978) could not be implemented. We hope that good sense will prevail with the South African Government and that, in their own longterm interests, as well as in the interests of the Namibian people and the international community, they will concede the inevitable with good grace. My delegation, which participated in the emergency special session of the General Assembly on Namibia, held early this month, reiterates its full support for the resolution that emerged from that session and calls for its immediate implementation.\n232.\tThe situation in the Middle East continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. The nations in the area continue to vie with each other to acquire sophisticated weapons, and, paradoxically, this has increased, rather than diminished, instability and insecurity in the region. It appears to us that the solution to the problem does not lie in sabre-rattling, but in acknowledging the fact that the question of the Palestinian people lies at the heart of the problem. In our view, there can be no durable peace in the Middle East unless the grave injustice done to the Palestinian people is rectified and they are permitted to return to their homeland and establish their own State. There should also be a complete restoration of all territories occupied through conquest. Simultaneously, there must be full recognition and appropriate international guarantees of the right of every State in the region to exist within secure and recognized boundaries. My delegation hopes that all the countries concerned, and especial!\\\"' the great Powers, will work to bring all the contending parties to the negotiating table and effect a solution on the basis of pragmatism and mutual accommodation. Recent experience has amply demonstrated that piecemeal attempts to resolve the differences among the parties concerned are likely to yield meaningful or long-lasting results, and in fact are likely to make the problem more intractable.\n233.\tThe recent deterioration in the relations between the power blocs have made efforts towards disarmament more difficult. With loss of faith in detente, the concept of negotiating from positions of strength has once again gained ascendancy. The inevitable result will be the production of ever more sophisticated weapons of mass destruction which, ironically, will not decrease but increase the chances of conflict, especially through proxies. At the same time, the diversion of tremendous resources to such unproductive purposes would diminish further the already inadequate resources available for combating widespread poverty in the developing countries, and poverty, in the ultimate analysis, represents the real threat to a stable world order.\n234.\tWe are at the threshold of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. At that session, we hope to see the emergence of concrete measures for implementing the Final Document of the tenth special session, contained in resolution S/102. Any meaningful progress towards disarmament can only be achieved if the bigger nations, and particularly the superPowers, demonstrate the necessary political will.\n235.\tAfter years of arduous negotiations, my delegation had expected consensus on the final draft text of the Convention on the Law of the Sea at the resumed tenth session held recently in Geneva. The enacting of such a law would minimize potential conflicts and prove equitable, at least to a degree, to all the members of the international community. We must realize that the law cannot take everyone's interests fully into account. There must be ah element of sacrifice, of give and take, for the sake of consensus and the larger interests of the international community. For instance, the landlocked countries which can least afford it have made major concessions during the course of the negotiations. We hope that all countries will now take expeditious steps to approve the final draft of the convention.\n236.\tThe international economic situation presents a grim picture. Today, more than 800 million people in developing countries, about two-thirds of them in South Asia, live in conditions of abject poverty. This situation can be attributed largely to the structural maladjustments of the existing international economic system. Unless the present system is restructured, there can be no durable solution to the fundamental economic problems facing the third world. The establishment of a new international economic order is in the interests of the entire international community, for unless remedial measures are taken in time, the seeds of tension and conflict inherent in poverty will one day engulf the world in a conflagration from which no country, developed or developing, can escape.\n237.\tMy delegation is concerned at the continuing deadlock in the talks for launching the global negotiations. Economic problems will continue to plague both the developed and developing countries unless these problems are tackled in a coordinated manner and on a global basis. Ad hoc and short-term palliatives provide no remedy for such problems. It is in the interest of all countries  make an urgent and serious attempt to tackle the causes of frequent disruptions in the world economy. A glaring example of what can occur was demonstrated by the sharp rise in petroleum prices during recent years, and the disastrous effect this had on the economies of many non-oil-producing developing countries. It is, therefore, imperative that global negotiations are launched without further delay. We hope that all the developed countries will demonstrate the necessary wisdom and political will in this regard.\n238.\tAlong with 30 other least developed countries, Bhutan placed considerable hope in the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris recently. Although concrete and time bound commitments were not made by the majority of the developed countries during the Conference, we appreciated their positive approach to the question , of promoting rapid economic development of the least developed countries during the 1980s. The Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries was adopted by consensus at the Conference. My delegation hopes that the international community will provide necessary assistance for the effective implementation of this program. It is only through such concerted action that the least developed countries can hope to overcome the serious obstacle to development inherent in their economies.\n239.\tTurning to our part of the world, an undertaking of great promise was launched last April in Colombo when the Foreign Secretaries of seven South Asian countries met to consider the feasibility of regional cooperation. The venture was the brainchild of the late President of Bangladesh, Mr. Ziaur Rahman, whose untimely death deprived our region of an outstanding leader. Owing to historical circumstances, the: countries of South Asia had so far been unable to initiate any move for regional cooperation. As a result of the Colombo meeting, and further follow-up steps, the outlook for regional cooperation is distinctly brighter now and we hope that the next meeting of foreign secretaries of South Asian countries, scheduled to be held in Katmandu later this year, will make the goal of South Asian cooperation a concrete reality rather than a distant dream. In the present circumstances, regional cooperation in South Asia has become an imperative necessity. My country will continue to support this venture as we are of the view that regional cooperation would contribute to the peace and wellbeing of the peoples of our region.\n240.\tIn Bhutan we have just launched our fifth FiveYear Plan for the social and economic development of our kingdom. The main elements of our new development policy are attainment of economic self-reliance, decentralization of administration, curbing of expenditure on establishment, increase of revenue, especially through mining and industry, and greater participation of the people in developmental projects. With the generous financial and technical assistance of our friendly neighbor, India, and of other bilateral sources, as well as from bodies of the United Nations system, such as UNDP, UNICEF, WFP, IFAD, UNFPA and UNCDF, we are confident that the main objectives of our fifth Plan will be achieved. UNDP not only has a highly effective program in Bhutan, but it has served as a useful channel for other United Nations agencies assisting Bhutan. Our fifth Plan differs from the preceding plans in that it is the personal handiwork of our wise and dynamic monarch, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuk, who has toured the length and breadth of our country consulting our people and finding out what they want, rather than letting the Government decide what the people should have. It is planning from the bottom upwards, and with the great enthusiasm that this plan has generated we are hopeful that it will be successfully implemented and will bring about a marked improvement in the living standards of our people.\n"

        "file_text": "98.\tI should like first to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important office of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to wish you every success in carrying out your tasks.\n99.\tI also congratulate Vanuatu and Belize on their admission to the Organization and wish the peoples of those countries success in their free and independent development.\n100.\tA survey of the events that have taken place since the previous session of the General Assembly shows that the situation in the world has become in general more complicated and explosive. The dangers that threaten peace and the sovereign peoples and countries that wish to enjoy and safeguard their legitimate rights and interests have become greater and more serious during the past year. In many regions of the world new elements have further endangered international peace and security. Many important and acute political problems which have rightly preoccupied progressive peoples and countries for a long time, far from having moved towards a solution, have become more difficult and complex day by day.\n101.\tOn the European continent, tension and political and military confrontation have mounted this year, and differences have become more acute. Hotbeds of tension and conflict have increased and spread in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. The whole region from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, right to the very center of Asia, has become an arena of aggressive war or preparations for war. The Zionist imperialist aggression against the Arab peoples and countries is continuing with increasing ferocity. Many hotbeds of tension also exist in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n102.\tThe growing aggressiveness of the imperialist superPowers, and in particular the intensification of the arms race and preparations for war, have during the current year aroused greater concern than ever everywhere in the world. The superPowers are increasing their war budgets at colossal rates. Arms sales and supplies have assumed new and greater proportions. The production of new systems of weapons of mass destruction, including the neutron bomb, has been given a new impetus. The United States of America and the Soviet Union and their aggressive military blocs, NATO and the Warsaw Treaty, have increased their military exercises both in number and in intensity. They have used them even more openly and directly than in the past as a means of applying pressure and blackmail, whether in Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East or the Indian Ocean.\n103.\tThese hazardous developments are occurring at a time when the general crisis of the capitalist revisionist world is constantly worsening and deepening. The serious economic and financial crisis which is shaking the foundations of the structure and the superstructure of the capitalist and revisionist countries has led to a further sharpening of all the inter-imperialist contradictions. In particular, the energy crisis has driven the imperialist Powers and monopolies to fierce competition and numerous disputes in their attempts to grab the reserves and markets of oil as well as of other raw materials, to supplant each other and to divide up spheres of influence. By resorting to violence and blackmail, demagogy and subversion, the superPowers and the imperialist Powers are trying to overcome the grave consequences of their economic and financial crisis growing inflation, unemployment and recession by intensifying their plunder and exploitation of other countries.\n104.\tNumerous facts and events show that the process of confrontation between democratic and progressive sovereign peoples and countries, on the one hand, and imperialism, social-imperialism and other forces of world reaction, on the other, is deepening more and more. This confrontation is reflected daily by the development of events in the world and by international relations in general. The true culprits responsible for the grave situation in the world today, for the hotbeds of aggression and war, for tension and insecurity and, indeed, for all present dangers and injustices are, first and foremost, the United States and the Soviet Union, who pursue an aggressive, neo-colonialist policy and try to dominate the world and subordinate the whole system of international relations to their own interests.\n105.\tThe American imperialists and the Soviet social imperialists have been and remain the greatest and most ferocious enemies of the peoples, the main source of war and aggression. In spite of the grave defeats they have suffered, they have become more unrestrained in their aggressive policies and activities; they have intensified their economic, political and military threats, blackmail and pressure, along with their plots and acts of subversion in different parts of the world, in order to establish their hegemony everywhere and divide the world into spheres of influence. As the leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, has stated:\n\\\"The great imperialist Powers are resorting to means of all kinds to preserve their markets and spheres of influence in the world today. When one loses a market in a certain region, it tries to win one in another region, to the detriment of its rival or rivals. That is the cause of imbalance, the source of deepening differences and disagreements, which reach the point of armed conflict; it gives rise to the arms race, to partial, localized wars which lead mankind into all-out, predatory, imperialist war.\\\"\n106.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union also raise a demagogic hue and cry about \\\"detente\\\" and their \\\"efforts\\\" to safeguard peace and security in the world, particularly in Europe. Inter-imperialist conflicts and the rivalry for hegemony in Europe have sharpened; the dangers that beset European peoples and countries have increased. Hence, the European peoples now see more clearly what lies behind the smokescreen of detente and the Helsinki, Belgrade and Madrid conferences on European security, or the farce of the Vienna talks. In this grave situation of tension and threat created in Europe by the United States and the Soviet Union, people cannot fail to see that, in spite of the fuss over the Final Act of Helsinki, adopted in 1975, the stockpiles of strategic nuclear weapons and the number of United States and Soviet tanks and aircraft on our continent have increased, as has the threat to genuine peace and security in Europe and in the world at large. In the light of the present dangerous developments in Europe, it clearly follows that the Final Act of Helsinki was formulated not to protect the sovereignty or the borders of the European States, but rather to preserve the spheres of influence of the two imperialist superPowers and to cause the European peoples to relax their vigilance. It was precisely for these reasons that the People's Socialist Republic of Albania opposed that demagogic Conference. The world has been well aware of this for some time, and experience has now proved our position correct.\n107.\tSimilarly, the situation in Europe keeps deteriorating, because of the fact that the two superPowers seek at all costs to strengthen their control and diktat over their allies, to patch up the cracks that appear in their political-military groupings and alliances and to compel the members of those alliances to increase their military expenditures and their financial contributions for the upkeep of foreign troops on their territories and, in general, to take upon themselves a heavier burden in all spheres of the preparations for war. The ever-growing proportions which the frenzied United States and Soviet conventional and nuclear arms races is assuming in Europe, apart from the great dangers that race poses for the sovereign peoples and countries of that continent, have also caused nervousness among the respective allies of the two superPowers. Last year a great deal was said and written about the stationing of the Soviet SS20 missiles and the United States cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in Europe. Each superPower tries to justify itself and blame the other for this escalation of the aims race, so fraught with grave consequences for Europe. But the truth is that both the United States and the Soviet Union pursue the same course and have the same aims. They want to turn Europe into an ammunition depot; they want to impose their diktat on the whole continent and, indeed, on their allies, through fear and blackmail.\n108.\tThroughout this complicated game for domination and hegemony played by the United States and the Soviet Union, alongside the agreement to preserve a certain beneficial status quo for themselves in Europe, they have never relaxed their efforts to challenge each other within their respective spheres of influence. The grave and chaotic situation created in Poland, as a result, of a process of general deterioration dating back to the revisionist twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is being utilized by the American imperialists and their allies to shake and weaken the dominant position of the soviet hegemonists in their sphere of influence. On their part, the Soviet social-imperialists spare neither threats nor flattery in dealing with the countries of Western Europe in order to turn them against Washington, especially concerning such problems as \\\"disarmament\\\", \\\"detente\\\", EastWest relations and so on. Similarly, Moscow tries to counterbalance the challenges of Washington in Poland with open demonstrations of strength; that is why it is keeping that country in a state of real military siege and is ceaselessly organizing large-scale military exercises in and around its territory.\n109.\tDespite the growing rivalry and sharpened tone of the mutual accusations between Washington and Moscow, it would be a mistake to forget that the two imperialist superPowers, even at such times, are able to find a common language in order to come to terms with each other, bypassing even their allies, and always to the detriment of sovereign peoples and States. Concern lest the growing AmericanSoviet rivalry should have grave consequences for international relations is well-founded; it has always been the case. But the dangers and tensions in the world would not be reduced even if the present stage of worsening relations between the two superPowers were to be replaced by a period of more tranquil relations, more frequent meetings and coordination of their activities. The policy, aims and actions of the United States and the Soviet Union continue to threaten and endanger the peoples of Europe and the entire world whether the leaders of those two superPowers embrace each other and sign treaties or harshly reproach each other.\n110.\tNor is the situation calm in the Balkan region, where there is a fresh intensification of political and military activity on the part of the United States and the Soviet Union, which exploit the grave socioeconomic situation and the turbulent elements dial have accumulated in one or the other Balkan country and vie with each other to entrench and strengthen their strategic positions in the region. This aim is also served by their growing presence in and their air and naval military buildup around the Balkans, by their efforts to secure military bases and port facilities there, and by the visits of their warships and the numerous military delegations that travel frequently from one country to another.\n111.\tThe Soviet social-imperialists are endeavoring to stir up chauvinist passions and sentiments, to encourage and deepen disagreements, to undermine the friendship among the Balkan peoples and to disturb peace and security in the region. We hold that acceptance of the interference of the imperialist superPowers in that region is fraught with dangerous consequences for the destinies of the Balkan peoples. Such an attitude runs counter to the lawful interests and aspirations of the Balkan peoples and the establishment of trust and sincere friendship among them.\n112.\tThe People's Socialist Republic of Albania, always acting on the basis of the policy of good-neighborliness and safeguarding the interests of the peoples, has fought and is fighting against every attempt and intrigue by the superPowers in the Balkans. It has always adhered to its public statement that no harm will ever come to its neighbors from Albania or through the territory of Albania. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania always adheres staunchly to the principles of noninterference in the internal affairs of other States and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country.\n113.\tThe Albanian Government has always displayed goodwill in the normal and fruitful development of relations of good-neighborliness with bordering States. It has made sincere specific efforts and has responded correctly to all useful initiatives for the development of relations in commercial, cultural and other fields. We have assessed the effects of our exchanges with neighboring States on the basis of official bilateral agreements and we are of the opinion that these have yielded positive results. In the future also, the Albanian Government will display the same goodwill in the development of such relations, and we hope that the Government of other countries will act similarly and with the same feeling of responsibility, to the advantage of all the peoples and of peace in the Balkan region.\n114.\tLast year we witnessed in the Mediterranean region a further increase in the military and naval buildup and activities of the two imperialist superPowers, which are trying t** extend further the network of their military bases in the Mediterranean countries and are intensifying their military exercises for offensive purposes quite close, in fact, to the territorial waters of other countries. The grave act of provocation by the naval aircraft of the United States against Libya, like other actions of the American and Soviet fleets in fee Mediterranean, reveals the danger posed by the presence of the fleets of the superPowers in this basin. Hence the Albanian delegation is> of the opinion that the Mediterranean countries must increase their efforts to compel tr? fleets of the superPowers to leave the Mediterranean\n115.\tThe Middle East continues to be one of the most dangerous hotbeds, where the political, economic and military-strategic predatory interests of the imperialist super Rowers clash, which could lead at any time to grave and generalized explosions. Both the United States and the Soviet Union are conducting feverish all-out political and military activities in the region, are provoking and threatening the peoples of those countries with armed attacks and are concentrating more intensively their aggressive fleets, military bases and forces around those countries. Furthermore, they have continued their activities to deepen further the division among the Arab countries es and to pit them against one another by stirring up local conflicts and tensions.\n116.\tMaking use, as always, of the direct support of the United States and of the turbulent situations created by the antiArab activities of the superPowers in the Middle East, the Israeli Zionists have undertaken other more aggressive acts, such as the criminal military attacks against Lebanon and the air raid against Iraq.\n117.\tLebanon is suffering a genuine tragedy. The sanguinary hand of the Israeli aggressor is daily dealing blows at the Lebanese people, and also at the Palestinian people, who have been left without a homeland by Zionism and imperialism. But the heroic Palestinian people have never laid down their weapons and have not ceased for a single moment the just struggle to win back their freedom and their homeland.\n118.\tThe Albanian people and Government, as in the past, stand firmly on the side of the Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples and firmly support their just cause.\n119.\tThe situation in the Gulf area, which is the largest oil bearing basin in the world, has become increasingly explosive as a result of the intensification of the aggressive activity and the policy of interference, provocation and blackmail pursued by the United States and the Soviet Union against the Iranian people and the other peoples of that region. Resorting to the use of counterrevolutionary forces and their espionage networks, they are trying to cause a wave of terror in Iran so as to prevent the Iranian Government from stabilizing the situation in the country and to bring the Iranian people to their knees. The United States imperialists still nurture the hope of regaining their lost privileges and position, while the Soviet social-imperialists seek to exploit the situation in their own favor. However, the revolutionary Iranian people, through their determined struggle, have overthrown the bloody Fascist regime of the Shah and are now dealing telling blows at the positions of imperialism in the Persian Gulf area. They will strengthen their vigilance and determination to safeguard their victories and cope with the hostile plots of the United States, the Soviet Union and other reactionary forces. The Albanian people have followed with regret the situation created as a result of the armed conflict between Iraq and Iran, which has inflicted great losses on the peoples of both countries. This conflict has been and is being exploited by imperialism, social-imperialism and Zionism, in order to interfere further in that region and to strike at and weaken the struggle of the peoples of the Middle East. In view of the development of events and the grave situations created for these peoples, today it has become more imperative than ever that this conflict be ended, that foreign troops withdraw from Iranian territory and that the problems between the two parties be solved through negotiations.\n120.\tThe Albanian people and Government once more express support for and solidarity with the valiant and freedom-loving people of Afghanistan in their struggle for the liberation of their country from the Soviet social-imperialist occupying forces. Without the withdrawal of the occupation troops from Afghanistan there can be no peace in that country or in the region.\n121.\tThe growing aggressiveness of social-imperialist China and its political-military alliance with United States imperialism, and the aggressive schemes and activities of the United States and the Soviet Union in IndoChina constitute the main factors in the continued worsening of the situation in SouthEast Asia. From their own experience the peoples of that region have realized the consequences for their freedom and independence of the \\\"friendship\\\" and \\\"aid\\\" offered by the United States, China or the Soviet Union; therefore they are forcefully opposing any kind of interference. These long-suffering peoples must be left free to settle for themselves their internal questions and their fate, without any foreign interference from any source and with strict respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country.\n122.\tAs always, the Albanian people and Government support the just struggle of the Korean people for the expulsion of the United States imperialists from South Korea and the independent unification of the homeland.\n123.\tThe rivalry of the superPowers and other imperialist Powers for spheres of influence and markets in Africa has further complicated the situation on that continent and has created hotbeds of conflict and tension in a number of countries and among various States. The United States and the Soviet Union are striving in different ways to bind a number of African countries to the system of imperialist and social-imperialist alliances. The United States and other imperialists are trying to justify their aggressive acts in Africa and the intensification of their political, economic and military support for the racists of South Africa on the ground of the need to counterbalance the interference of the Soviet Union in that continent. For their part, the Soviet social-imperialists like to present their interference as support for the African peoples against imperialism. In fact, whether in South Africa or in other parts of the African continent, the two imperialist superPowers pursue the same objectives and have become embroiled in a feverish race for spheres of influence and military bases, grossly violating the rights and interests of many African countries.\n124.\tThis activity on the part of the superPowers encourages South Africa's racist regime to persist in its policy of apartheid, to keep Namibia under its colonial rule and to carry out provocation and armed aggression against the African countries, as it did recently in Angola. In all their aggressive activity, the racists of South Africa enjoy the full support of the imperialist Powers and, first and foremost, that of the United States. In these conditions it is clear that the path of armed struggle is the only one that will lead the Namibian people to the attainment of its rights and aspirations. The Albanian people has supported and will always support the just liberation struggle being waged by the Namibian people for freedom and national independence.\n125.\tThe difficult situation in some Latin American countries shows that the peoples of that part of the world are being confronted more and more by the interference of imperialism and by superPower plots.\n126.\tFacts and events daily show that the just struggle of freedom-loving peoples throughout the world for freedom and national independence remains powerful. This is a clear reflection of their growing hatred and indignation against the occupiers, oppressors and exploiters, of their determination ever more powerfully to strike out at the imperialist Powers and their tools and to stay the hand of the aggressors who threaten peace and mankind with an imperialist world war.\n127.\tThe struggles of peoples and of all oppressed masses are the main force shaking the very foundations of the capitalist-revisionist world and opposing the aggressors and warmongering schemes and actions of world imperialism. The imperialist Powers have been and are being dealt successive and powerful blows by the struggle of peoples throughout the world who cherish peace and freedom. The \\\"grave defeat which the Iranian people inflicted on United States imperialism, the blows that the valiant Afghan people are dealing at the Soviet aggressors, the constant intensification of the struggle being waged by peoples against the aggressive and hegemonistic policy of the superPowers enhance the optimism and strengthen the confidence of peoples throughout the world in their invincibility.\n128.\tToday, this struggle is present and evident everywhere in the world. Its results can be clearly seen in the constant weakening of the positions of imperialism, social imperialism and other reactionary forces.\n129.\tThe Albanian people and its Government have supported and will always strongly support the just struggle of peoples for liberation, for the defense of their national independence and sovereignty and for self-determination. They have stood and will always stand on the side of peoples fighting for genuine freedom and equality against oppression, violence and terror; for the rooting out of colonialism, against neocolonialism and racial discrimination; against the intrigues, plots and brutal interferences of the imperialist Powers and, first and foremost, of the superPowers.\n130.\tThe People's Socialist Republic of Albania will, as ever, continue to back the struggle of the sovereign peoples and countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America against the political, economic and military aggression of the United States, the Soviet Union, China and other imperialist Powers. Today, the peoples of the world are becoming ever more conscious of the danger posed by the attempts of the imperialist Powers to maintain and intensify their exploitation of them, by implementing neo-colonialist theories and practices of \\\"interdependence\\\", \\\"aids\\\", \\\"credits\\\", \\\"multinational collaboration and cooperation\\\" and other forms of plunder and exploitation. We support all the efforts and the just struggle of different peoples and countries to attain and strengthen their economic independence and to place all their national assets under their full control, to defend them from neo-colonialist plundering and to utilize them for the benefit of their independent economic and social development.\n131.\tThe People's Socialist Republic of Albania, a fully independent country, is growing and developing with total reliance on its own forces, on the sweat and selfless work of its people, on the material and financial resources which our own country possesses and creates, without receiving credits or aid from abroad. It has developed and is extending its relations with an ever-growing number of States constantly and on a sound basis. In trade, cultural exchanges and other fields, Albania displays correctness, never implicating itself in political machinations, never damaging the interests of others, never falling into autarchy or retiring within itself.\n132.\tIn spite of the effects of the grave economic crisis in the world, our country is developing and progressing constantly and is achieving satisfactory rates of economic development and an improvement in the wellbeing of the working masses. The Albanian people does not know unemployment, price rises or inflation, economic crises, corruption and moral degeneration or other such ills, which are increasingly afflicting the working masses in the bourgeois revisionist world.\n133.\tThe successful completion of the sixth five-year plan, for the period 19761980, has led to the improvement and further strengthening of the economic structure of our country, thus further consolidating its economic independence and enabling it to aspire to greater development in the future. This five-year plan was marked by a further increase in the production of electric power, oil and coal. As regards food, we are self-sufficient. All bread is produced locally for the people, as is 85 per cent of its needs in industrial mass consumer goods.\n134.\tNow our people have set themselves to work to carry out the seventh five-year plan for the development of our economy and culture. This new five-year plan will be carried out totally on the basis of our own strength, without any aid or credits from abroad. The average annual production will be approximately 1.5 times higher than the annual production over the past decade. Basic investments will be approximately 1.4 times higher, and export revenues abeuPtwice as large. The diversification of our industry will be further strengthened, giving priority to the development of heavy industries. The energy base, in particular the oil industry, will be further strengthened. Investments in agriculture will increase and we will progress towards its further intensification. During the seventh five-year plan, great progress will be achieved in the fields of education, culture, science and the protection of the health of the people. The Albanian people, under the direct leadership of the Labor Party of Albania, which this year will mark its fortieth anniversary and which is so wisely led by its founder, Comrade Enver Hoxha, is advancing proudly towards its future, aware of the fact that, thanks to its unremitting toil, it will carry forward the cause of the construction and the defense of socialism in Albania.\n135.\tAt the present time, as we are witnessing a worsening of the international situation and increased dangers and threats to peace and to the peoples of the world, the People's Socialist Republic of Albania will not fail to make its modest contribution to the sincere efforts of the peoples and countries which love peace and freedom to stay the hand of the aggressors and ensure true security throughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\n73.\t Mr. President, the Republic of Iraq and the Democratic Republic of Madagascar enjoy very close relations, and therefore you will understand the special satisfaction we feel at seeing you preside over the work of the \nthirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In you, Sir, we greet a representative of the nonaligned third world who has already placed at the disposal of his county, of our movement and of this Organization the devotion and the faith with which you are naturally endowed, as well as the experience that you have acquired in many international bodies.\n74.\tWe should like to address our thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, for the perfect fashion in which he conducted the diverse and very complex work of our last session. We also wish to pay tribute to the SecretaryGeneral for the efforts he has undertaken in the interests of the Organization and of the international community.\n75.\tThe Malagasy delegation is among the many delegations that sponsored the resolutions recommending the admission of Vanuatu and Belize, not because we were necessarily honoring a tradition born of a common colonial past, but because we attach great significance to the triumph of right, to the struggle of peoples for liberation and to their desire to recover and reaffirm their identity in order to participate fully in international life. We congratulate the Republic of Vanuatu and Belize and we assure the two delegations of our fraternal cooperation.\n76.\tIn the course of the general debate at the \nthirty-fifth session [11th meeting], we tried to explain to the Assembly our concern regarding the maintenance and the strengthening of peace in our region, the need to formulate a new definition of collective security based essentially on mutual acceptance of interests, the equality of those interests and their integration in the search for the common good.\n77.\tSince then the feeling of insecurity has become generalized. The interdependence of the 1970s has been overtaken by a dependence considered more reassuring. The basic imbalance of political power has caused a renewal of the efforts aimed at bi-polarization, to the extent that we can again speak of a new realignment that has become a source of tension, confrontation and open or covert conflict.\n78.\tWe are therefore justified in saying that, far from being dissipated, the concern we expressed at that time has been confirmed and the development of a situation marked by the elaboration of antinomian strategies has stood in the way of the search for cooperative solutions of international problems in accordance with the avowed mission of our Organization. Are we then to conclude that there is a deliberate desire to challenge the purposes and principles of the Charter? We dare not think that, since many Powers would be forced, because of what they perceived to be the facts, to bend the principles to suit their purpose, thus frustrating the desire of the peoples for the world of peace and security promised by the Charter.\n79.\tSpecific alliances and the policy of force have prevailed at the expense of the collective security that was envisaged in 1945, to the extent that, instead of enjoying equal security in accordance with the Charter, we are living in equal insecurity under the threat of nuclear weapons capable of destroying the world many times over. Peace has ceased to be the major concern, putting the survival of mankind at risk, and the dangers of nuclear warfare have unfortunately become a reality. Worldwide and extended confrontation in the military, political, commercial and technological fields has taken the place of detente.\n80.\tThe new doctrine of a limited nuclear war, which is intended to make acceptable what is unthinkable, is accompanied by other decisions, such as those concerning the substantial and constant growth of military expenditures, the unilateral designation of so-called zones of vital interest, the extension of areas of intervention, not to mention such projects as the treaty of the southern Atlantic, in which the South African racist regime is the keystone.\n81.\tThe United Nations undoubtedly has a role to play in defusing this situation, a role that cannot be tainted with resignation or complacency. It is politically and morally unjustifiable to allow the security of the world to depend on relations among the nuclearweapon States.\n82.\tAt best, that system might function, and those Powers would settle world affairs in accordance with their own interests, completely ignoring the right of other States to equal security. At worst and this seems to be the present situation the nuclear club would fail to fulfill its responsibilities, bilateral, regional and multilateral negotiations would be broken off or blocked, and the rest of mankind would realize with anguish how precarious the situation was.\n83.\tIt is for these reasons that we cannot hide the dismay we feel at the lack of true progress since the adoption in 1978 of the program of Action for disarmament [see General Assembly resolution S10/2].\n84.\tWe hope that the second special session devoted to disarmament, planned for next spring, will allow us to draw some lessons from the negotiations which have taken place in the Committee on Disarmament during the last three years, while it will still be useful to pay greater attention to the definition of those measures that might give new impetus to the process of disarmament. At this stage we shall not take up the questions of the program, the priorities or the specific measures; we shall merely limit ourselves to recalling that the will of State\\\" for peace must precede disarmament, not follow it.\n85.\tThe success of that session, as of any disarmament undertaking,, must depend on the proof given by States that they are inspired by that will for peace and not by the search for domination, hegemony, military superiority or confrontation.\n86.\tIt is for this reason that we believe that the non aligned nations can contribute to the achievement of our common goal by defending the principles of peaceful coexistence which underlie the political philosophy of the movement, by refusing to be treated as pawns in an antinomian political game, by refusing to allow themselves to be dragged into, military alliances, by rejecting the efforts to rationalize the arms race, and. by denouncing the deceptive propaganda which establishes an inverted priority between disarmament and security and, with equivocal selectivity, ignores the alliance between the imperialists and the Zionist entity and\\\" the South African racist regime.\n87.\tThese last considerations inspired the initiative that led to the adoption of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)], of which this year we celebrate the tenth anniversary. This is more pertinent than ever, despite the inability of the Ad Hoe Committee on the Indian Ocean to decide upon the date of the Colombo conference, which had originally been scheduled for 1981. Need we recall the understandable disquiet that was shown by the littoral and hinterland countries which almost unanimously recognized, contrary to certain claims, that the existing conditions of insecurity militated in favor of the holding of that conference?\n88.\tAs far as we are concerned, we shall press for the Colombo conference, the agenda of which must truly reflect the principles of the Declaration, to take place before the end of 1982, and for the summit conference at Antananarivo to be held in 1983. May I at this point recall the proposal by the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar, which was presented and explained during the \nthirty-fifth session [11th meeting], and which demonstrates our desire to define the nature of the commitments that must govern the mutual relations of the States concerned with the security of the Indian Ocean region, on the basis of the principles established at United Nations level.\n89.\tThe difficulties that we encounter in the Indian Ocean area lead us to recall the crises that affect other . regions too, for which solutions must be found on the' basis of our principles and not seen through the deforming prisms of bloc interests.\n90.\tElimination of the apartheid regime has always come up against the mental block of certain circles who fear change and contend that the liberation of the Africans and their assumption of political power in South Africa would be a threat to specific interests. That attitude, which contributed to delaying the breakup of former colonial empires, explains the will of some to liken liberation movements to terrorist groups. It also justifies the maintenance of so-called normal relations, even a policy of rapprochement, with the racist regime, raised to the rank of a stable and strategic ally. Finally, it is shown by opposition to the policy of sanctions and by the subordination of the future of the African majority to the hazards of East West confrontation.\n91.\tWe consider that no specific interest is worthy of being opposed to the restoration of human dignity, justice, freedom and peace for the victims of apartheid. We strongly support the struggle of the African majority, under the leadership of their authentic liberation movement, and demand that the Security Council impose mandatory global sanctions on South Africa in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.\n92.\tIn Namibia, the same causes have produced the same effects. The complaisance I would even say the complicity of certain western Powers has encouraged the racist regime to defy the United Nations, which, through the United Nations Council for Namibia, is the legal Administering Authority of that Territory.\n93.\tThe adherence of the Western contact group to the idea of imposing constitutional principles, even before the future constituent assembly of Namibia has been elected, seems to us to be an inadmissible restriction on the sovereignty of that assembly. It is, to say the least, ironic that those who have insisted most on guaranteeing that that assembly shall be the true reflection of the will of the Namibian people should today be the first to usurp some of its powers. That is not our idea of independence and sovereignty, which must be vested in the Namibian people alone.\n94.\tWe reaffirm the position of the Government of Madagascar, as communicated to the SecretaryGeneral and made known at the eighth emergency special session [6th meeting]. Either the United Nations should decide to implement immediately and unconditionally Security\nCouncil resolution 435 (1978); or it should request the United Nations Council for Namibia, the legal Administering Authority, unilaterally to declare Namibia's independence, under the aegis of SWAPO, the authentic representative of the Namibian people recognized by the international community.\n95.\tThe recent aggressions of the racist regime against Angola have rightly been condemned by the whole international community. It is to be regretted that the veto of one Power prevented the Security Council from joining in that condemnation.\n96.\tWe also note that the ministers and heads of delegations of the nonaligned countries have taken note with satisfaction of the decisions adopted by the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity held at Nairobi from 24 to 27 June 1981, on the organization of a general and free referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara [see Al361534, annex If, AHG/Res.103 (XVIII)].\n97.\tIn a declaration made public on 31 August 1981, the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar said that he considered as positive the recommendations of the Implementation Committee on Western Sahara of the OAU [see A/36/512, annex] which met at Nairobi from 24 to 26 August 1981 to give effect to the Assembly's decisions. He believed that the acceptance by the Committee of the idea of setting up in Western Sahara an interim, international, nonaligned authority to ensure the carrying out of the referendum was a further positive step. However, no genuine free and democratic referendum can possibly be held while the Moroccan army and administration remain on Sahraoui territory.\n98.\tIn the Middle East, true to its policy of expansion and regional hegemony, Israel increases its aggressions and \\\"preventive reprisals\\\" against its neighbors. Its raid on Iraq's nuclear installations was rightly and unanimously condemned by the Security Council.\n99.\tAt the same time, using as a pretext troubles caused by one faction, the Tel Aviv authorities implacably continued their dismemberment of Lebanon, taking the opportunity at the same time to implement their campaign of genocide against the Palestinian refugees. We reaffirm our support for the sovereignty of Lebanon and respect for its territorial integrity, unity and political independence, and call for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\n100.\tThose acts of aggression only further complicate the search for a solution to the question of Palestine,, which more than ever lies at the heart of the Middle East problem. We shall continue during this session to give our support to the proposals of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. We welcome the increasingly widening consensus given to the recognition of those rights, including the right of return, the right to self-determination and the right to establish an independent and sovereign State in Palestine.\n101.\tIt is high time for the Security Council to take note of that consensus and to agree to amend and to complete in this sense the all-too-notorious Solution 242 (1967), which otherwise is in danger of becoming a monument to injustice.\n102.\tThe Asian continent is shaken by crises, which certain instruments of propaganda present to us through clever caricatures intended to cast doubt on the true aspirations of the peoples concerned and further to divide the Movement of NOnAligned Countries.\n103.\tApart from any ideological considerations, we believe that two principles are valid the clearly expressed will of the peoples and the need at all costs to find a politically negotiated solution to all disputes. That is why the question of Afghanistan could be solved on the basis of any constructive proposal, particularly that which was made public on 24 August 1981 by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan [see A/36/457, annex]. Likewise, in the case of Kampuchea, we believe that a meeting between the countries directly concerned, without external interference, could lead to a solution which would not threaten the credibility of our Organization.\n104.\tWe offer our support to the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to convene a conference of the democratic parties of the North and South, which should lead to the v nation of a great Korean confederation, the Confederal Democratic Republic of Koryo.\n105.\tThe recrudescence of tensions in Central America and the Caribbean causes us disquiet. As a nonaligned' country, we uphold the legitimacy of the struggles of peoples subjected for years to injustice and domination. Attempts at destabilization, economic pressures and other hostile acts against the States of the region can meet with nothing but general condemnation and provoke reactions that are not always to the taste of certain parties.\n106.\tOur solidarity with the peoples concerned is known, for, here as elsewhere, only they have the right, in full sovereignty and freedom, to decide their own political, economic and social affairs.\n107.\tIn the economic field the outlook is not much better, because the crisis of which we have seen the omens for over a decade is now upon us, and has been given added impetus by the inroads of contention and counterclaims, which are undermining existing structures and for which we can find no more than palliatives in the absence of a real development ethic. We are resentful of the basic injustice of growth by groups, which is now losing sight of the basic idea of bridging the gap and instead is far too close to parallel but separate, and therefore basically unequal, development.\n108.\tThis blinkered approach favors the notion of immediate or short-term benefits, as well as what might be called, for want of a better term, international profiteering, based on selfishness, impatience and shortsightedness. Is there still a true desire to find any answer to this crisis, or are we resigned to the fact that two humanities exist, looking at one another across the divide created by unrepentant imperialism?\n109.\tThis is well illustrated by our inability this year to undertake the global negotiations provided for in General Assembly resolution 34/138, the holdup in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law Of the Sea, so many events which demonstrate that in spite of Our protestations the commitments assumed under the Charter \\\"to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples\\\" are still limited. The procrastination of some and the ill will of others hide behind the pretext of a search for a consensus at all costs, thus leading to the undermining of international cooperation and the exacerbation of the world economic crisis.\n110.\t^\tAll our countries are affected by that crisis whose hallmark is a breakdown in economies, currency fluctuations, a chronic international payments deficit, the continuing trend towards higher interest rates, inflation and unemployment, the inadequacy of traditional adjustment measures and the uncertain prospects of growth, even for the medium term, all of which encourage a return to a more or less disguised protectionism.\n111.\tBut egotism is not solely to blame, for we see that the countries that are most seriously affected are the developing countries, above all the non-oil-producing countries, whose external debts and balance of payments deficits have become disastrous. We are also paying dearly for the rhetoric in which some of our partners try to wrap up global prospects for development, since we are being offered only a patching up of the present system, which is functionally unsuited to restoring stability and ensuring .he growth of our economies.\n112.\tOnce again we can fall back on skepticism and resignation. But we reaffirm that the only way of establishing equality of opportunity and eliminating the damaging effects of mistrust is the multilateral and global approach to the problems that underlie the present crisis. The International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held at Cancun may contribute to providing a fresh momentum to cooperation between two worlds that are condemned to interdependence, to the extent that the lines decided on in the context of the new international economic order are respected.\n113.\tThe principles agreed on from Arusha to Caracas concerning cooperation among developing countries were not conceived in a spirit of confrontation or competition, but in reaffirmation of our will to provide ourselves with institutions designed to solve the major problems posed by the requirements of an equal and integrated development.\n114.\tWe need not conceal this any longer: the 1980s will be difficult years and we will have to temper the optimism of the last two decades. Each State will have to bear its part. Each State will have to find the means to survive the crises that will occur and recover the security, equilibrium and prosperity to which it has a right. But what should our Organization do to reverse the new political alienation, to revive the vision of one world united economically and socially?\n115.\tMore than once we have undertaken a redefinition of the role of the United Nations. Studies have been undertaken, committees have been set up, and yet we find ourselves at the same impasse, which seems to confirm the Views of those who defend the status quo, because our efforts have been reduced to attempting to reconcile irreconcilable interests or, at best, to collate divergent national reactions. And thus we are forced to ask ourselves whether the collective will to restore international life to its universality can still exist.\n116.\tWe have been told that the Charter represented and still represents the best hope of inducing mankind to accept universality. We are aware that for some it is no longer considered as anything more than one reference among many others, and that from being the only means of reducing the dangers of tension, confrontation and conflict, it has sometimes become an instrument of justification for a partial review of relations among nations.\n117.\tFrom one session to another we reaffirm our faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter, and from one session to another also we see this increasing reluctance to resort to the existing machinery embracing practically every area of cooperation or to make it more effective, by taking account of change or even, I venture to say, of resolutions adopted since the machinery was first established.\n118.\tNational sovereignty and national interests are put forward to hamper the role and the activities of the United Nations. But how can the preponderance of the United Nations which we accepted in the Charter restrain a sovereignty that cannot be more absolute? What interest do we have, acting collectively and in unity, in preventing world problems from being dealt with by a multilateral approach and being given global solutions?\n119.\tIf the principles of the Charter remain valid for us at all times and in all circumstances, as experience shows, if we are ready to revitalize the objectives of the Charter so that they are more responsive to the aspirations of all peoples, if we have the courage to set aside our contradictions and accept the ineluctable evolution of mankind towards peace, progress and justice, then let us give our Organization the political means to fulfill its purposes, because that is the best way of reaffirming our confidence in ourselves and really promoting mutual confidence.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, let me begin this statement on behalf of the Argentine Republic by expressing our sincere congratulations to you on your assumption of the most important post in the General Assembly. Your election represents not only an acknowledgment of your personal distinction, but also shows the respect of the community of nations for your country. The Organization may be sure that it has entrusted this high mission to an experienced diplomat who is aware of the grave responsibilities that his task involves.\n2.\tIn your recent visit to Buenos Aires, in the company of the VicePresident of Iraq, our two countries restated the importance of their cordial, longstanding and fruitful relations.\n3.\tArgentina would also like to reiterate and reaffirm its high esteem for the ability and efficiency with which your predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, of the Federal Republic of Germany, carried out this particularly difficult task during the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and the emergency special session.\n4.\tWe express our satisfaction at the admission of the new independent State of Vanuatu as the one hundred and fifty-fifth Member of the Organization. We are sure that it will contribute to the fulfillment of the Organization's goals of peace and development.\n5.\tAt the same time, I should like to express the satisfaction of the Argentine people and Government at the independence of Belize which was actually proclaimed yesterday and which constitutes an example of how the outstanding problems of decolonization may be resolved with a sense of history and realism, with decisiveness and without premature discouragement in the negotiations.\n6.\tMay I therefore convey to each of those new States the Argentine Republic's desire to broaden relations of friendship and cooperation with them.\n7.\tThis new session of the General Assembly brings with it, as usual, a world round of analysis and thought, which indeed is one of its main purposes. As it is opening at the start of a decade that appears to be tense and full of conflict, it demands above all a balance-sheet of the essential elements inherited from the 36 years that have elapsed since hope emerged after devastation without precedent.\n8.\tToday, as in the beginning, a single idea has remained defined with a clarity that does not allow for nuances: it is the idea of peace. There is no alternative to opting for peace. The Organization came into being under that inspiration and with that as its objective. The technology for destruction that has been developed since then has excluded world war as a conceivable instrument in any political program. The essentially immoral instruments of destruction that mankind has created have ensured an option that cannot be challenged; one that, so far, neither the ethical approach nor justice has been able to secure. Unfortunately, this lack of alternative to peace has neither improved the conditions of world security nor made it possible to thieve progress along paths that seemed promising only a few years ago. The international society, for some time multi-polar in the political and economic fields, is still supported by a bipolar arc in the field of final military power. This situation at present gives rise to growing tension.\n9.\tThe disappointing developments in the recent negotiations on disarmament in the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the virtual paralysis as regards SALT have occurred at the same time as the emergence of new conflicts, which follow those that for years have been receiving the attention of the Organization.\n10.\tThe idea of disarmament has been replaced in practice, first, by the concept of a slowdown of the arms race and, secondly, by the parity of military power. This has tended to dispel many illusions; indeed, we all know that a vicious circle has been created. True parity can never be established in such times of technological buildup. Every effort to close any real or imaginary gap inevitably creates yet another gap, imaginary or real.\n\n11.\tThis process has a strong inherent logic. The increasing arms buildup comes from a sense of insecurity. This feeling persisted among all the protagonists despite all the unquestionable progress made during the cycle of so-called detente. Viewed in retrospect, it is clear that that necessary progress was far from sufficient and that today a further effort is needed, under much worse conditions. There is not the slightest doubt that the distrust between the main protagonists has increased. Nor is there any doubt that nothing deserves higher priority at this stage than efforts to recreate appropriate conditions for dialog.\u2003\n12.\tThe obvious crisis through which the world security system is passing is aggravated by the equally unacceptable crisis affecting the system of ideas underlying it. For example, there is the clear care of those ideologies that believed they had grasped the meaning of history and were capable of building a final model society free of contradictions. Any observer today can clearly see that some of the most ominous changes threatening peace derive expressly from the objective existence of the contradictions supposedly overcome in that model.\n13.\tInsecurity and the ideological crisis are at the root of the emergence and universal spread of terrorism. It is evident that this real scourge has not only new dimensions but also a new essence. Contemporary terrorism constitutes one of the most dangerous assaults on the human condition. It is, above all, an assault on reason, similar to many assaults that history has known before, and it lacks any ethical motivation. Present day terrorism is a highly professional manifestation of naked power, with a worldwide organization, which is increasingly refined and threatens even those who succumb to the temptation to support it, directly or indirectly.\n14.\tWe Argentinians cannot but recall in this dramatic context the attempt on the life of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, whose efforts to promote understanding among peoples are clearly exemplified by his welcome mediation* in the border dispute between Argentina and the Republic of Chile.\n15.\tA look at the world situation reveals a picture with many shadows, among which problems that have been included for many years now in the agenda of these sessions and those that have been added recently stand out. The common denominator is the element of national, regional or world insecurity.\n16.\tA single thread characterizes the most serious cases. The persistent delay in the solution of the Palestine problem, the nonrecognition of Israel by most of the Arab countries, the unacceptable risk of annexing the territories occupied after the 1967 war, the bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor, the attack on Lebanon and the attack on the Vienna synagogue represent stern appeals to the conscience and sense of responsibility of all countries represented here. Another such is the continued illegal interference in Afghanistan, where one superPower is expressing its idea of national security at the cost of the security of a neighbor which by no stretch of the imagination can be classified as dangerous. Exactly the same can be said of Viet Nam's interference in Kampuchea another instance of a threat to regional security. In this world in which colonialism is now in its twilight, its continuing existence in the flagrant example of Namibia and the unacceptable delay in the process to independence of that country demonstrate how a situation of this kind can directly threaten not only regional but also world peace and security.\n17.\tThese four situations, which constitute extreme cases in the present international scene, all have a common denominator, namely, the violation of fundamental principles of world order and of the Charter of the United Nations. They all involve the self-determination of peoples, a violation of the principle of nonintervention, a breach of territorial integrity and an attack on sovereignty. The invoking of their own security by the interested parties is a cover for conduct that clearly violates the security of others and thus threatens the security of everyone. It seems both clear and rational that the security that they supposedly desire to preserve would be better guaranteed by a precise definition of its own limits,\n18.\tIn so far as those problems fall within the specific competence of the United Nations, \\\"some comments on the methodology of their handling by the Organization are called for. The first concerns the need to adopt realistic political approaches that include activities and explore prospects, and lead to specific solutions. Those solutions must take into consideration both the objectives aimed at in each case and the purposes and principles of the Charter, in order if possible to obtain consensus among Members of the Organization. When the defense of a principle or worthy cause is at stake, it is much more effective to obtain the minimum common denominator acceptable to all than to put forward extreme proposals that inevitably give rise to reservations that neutralize them in practice. The second comment underlines the need to place more emphasis on negotiations and dialog between the countries directly involved in each problem, with the participation of the United Nations Secretariat where necessary, without prejudice to the concerted action agreed upon in the resolutions addressed to all Member States.\n19.\tFrom the point of view of Latin America, these considerations seem timely. It is evident that this continent, and Central America in particular, has entered an extremely critical phase. Possible actual violations of fundamental principles that have led to serious disputes in other areas are now a matter of real concern for the people of Central America, as shown clearly by the case of El Salvador.\n20.\tThe highly dangerous potential for an escalation of conflicts in Latin America does not seem to be clearly perceived in other areas, especially in some developed countries that appear to see those disputes as a problem of spheres of influence relating to the prevailing political trends in Europe.\n21.\tThis false perspective especially prevalent on the part of industrialized European countries, has also been, and is being, committed, although in a reverse sense, in the field of human rights. In the name of human rights there has been, and still is, an uncalled for and, by some sectors a distinctly superficial, interference in situations of internal security which in no way affect international peace and security. That interference is clearly a violation of the spirit and letter of the Charter. It constitutes, in fact, a very significant and decisive support of the subversive terrorist activities that really might create actual situations endangering international peace and security.\n22.\tObviously such peace and security must reflect all of the elements underlying the system of international relations. The Organization was founded at a time when there was hardly any discussion of economic development and underdevelopment. However, as far back as 1945, San Francisco was the meeting point of highly industrialized countries and others that had not even taken the first steps towards modernization. The great campaign to dislodge colonialism, in which many of the battles were fought in these halls, multiplied the number of developing countries. Their political weight increased, but that did not narrow the gap separating them from the big centers of finance, industry and technology.\n23.\tThe 1973 crisis, in which the new oil prices acted as a catalyst, did not change the essence of the problem, but introduced into the situation aggravating elements of decisive effect. In order to check these, on the initiative of the Group of 77, a more extensive dialog was begun based on the fact that the fates of developed and developing countries were clearly linked through their interdependence and they must therefore join in seeking a global agreement that would make it possible to find the basis for a sustained and balanced growth of the world economy. Our skepticism about developments thus far in no way detracts from the validity of that program or that approach.\n24.\tIt is now more urgent than ever to reverse the trends that are becoming more marked in a situation of acute recession, but it must be on the basis of a realistic analysis of the situation.\n25.\tThe increase in oil prices generated a regionalization of profits and a general spread of losses as a consequence of such a monumental redistribution of world earnings without the establishment in the meantime of \\\"structural measures designed to correct the inherent distortions. During the whole process, the developing countries oil producing or  non-oil-producing maintained their solidarity and unity, in spite of the fact that most of them were the worst affected.\n26.\tAfter some hesitation as to whether priority should be given to checking unemployment or inflation, this, new situation led all the industrialized countries to emphasize action against inflation, and adopt measures that reinforced the recessive trends in their own economies.\n27.\tBut as the recycling of financial surpluses was finally channeled to the industrialized States through private banks, those States availed themselves of a series of mechanisms which helped them to overcome their main basic problems. They introduced more streamlined protectionist policies, passed on the higher cost of money and oil to the prices of their products and services, and made aggressive inroads into the international market with new subsidized exports that compete unfairly with the traditional exports of the developing countries.\n28.\tObviously the non-oil producing developing countries are the ones that meet the cost of balancing the accounts. They have to pay more for energy, for capital goods, for industrial inputs, for finished products and, more specifically, for currency.\n29.\tThere being no other solution, the balance of payments on current account of three quarters of the international community has become structurally deficit ridden. Because of this development, members of the international community have responded to these negative trends with measures designed to remedy or alleviate them, although they do not yet form part of an effective concerted effort consonant with the problems identified. It is a proven fact that the developing world remain^ united in solidarity, in spite of the fact that some of those measures were also designed to divide it.\n30.\tThe most important factor after 1973 has undoubtedly been the recycling of financial surpluses in the petroleum-exporting countries to the economies of the industrialized countries. This is a fact that can only be remedied with large scale measures. Otherwise, in a few years time the present trends will lead the international community to completely unacceptable situations. The oil-exporting countries and the industrialized nations today have an inescapable responsibility for the global redistribution of resources and growth. If the need for a solvent world demand was very clear 20 years ago, it is out of the question to sit idly by today watching the extension of insolvency to the entire world.\n31.\tWhile international dialog is pursued in New York, Caraballeda, Ottawa, Nairobi, Paris and Cancun without our getting any closer to a global approach to substantive policies, our conscience is struck by the situation eloquently described by His Holiness John Paul II in his recent encyclical Laborem Exercens, a document which is a virtual program of action for the countries assembled here.\n32.\tOne could devote a great deal of time to the analysis of the situation, but the diagnosis would always be the same: there is no solution that does not involve reactivating the world economy, and this calls for a massive increase of cooperation with the developing countries. This is tantamount to saying that there will be no future prosperity for the great world economies of today if industrialization is not extended to all countries in the world.\n33.\tArgentina is the only developing country which is both self-sufficient in the energy sector and a substantial food exporter. It is therefore in a better position to judge the present trends. I would stress that the world food situation is as serious as ever and that the reduced interest which it evokes only reveals a shameful acceptance of backwardness, injustice and hopelessness. A world in which, pari passu, missiles and misery are built up threatens an explosion somewhere.\n34.\tI have taken the liberty of expressing some viewpoints of the Argentine Government, which are those of my people. The Argentine nation, as all representatives are aware, has inherited Western culture. It shares all the values that are inherent in that culture: a profound belief in freedom, in the alienable rights of the human person, in their defense through the mechanisms of a pluralist society, in the sovereignty of the people and in the republican form of government. Its national and international ideals were formed by men like Sarmiento, Calvo, Drago, SSenz Pena, Pueyrreddn, and Saavedra Lamas.\n35.\tIn this Organization, as in the one that preceded it, Argentina has always played an active role, which has been permanently documented, through the most diverse Governments and in the most difficult internal situations. My country passed through one such situation a few years ago, when it suffered one of the most violent acts of aggression ever perpetrated by international terrorism. Argentina overcame that aggression by its own means, not asking for anyone's help. No one can say that my country is a threat to the peace or security of anyone. For that reason, we have not been prepared to permit interference in our internal affairs by anyone, either in the events that are part of history or in the present process of democratic reconstruction in which we are engaged, although our doors are open for everyone to see what we are doing and we are ready for a dialog with anybody.\n36.\tIn that dialog Argentina will be, as it has always been, a zealous defender of international order, of the rights of the national State, of the principles of sovereignty; of nonintervention, of self-determination of peoples and, above all, of peace among nations. Argentina reaffirms those principles, which it has always adhered to and which it shares with the States members of the non aligned movement in which our country plays a part and whose principles we hope will be vigorously reaffirmed at the next summit conference in Baghdad in 1982 in the face of any attempt to weaken the Movement. Those principles, as well as the repudiation of all forms of racism or discrimination such as apartheid or any other kind of discrimination based on creed, culture, caste or class, are inherent in a nation that attained freedom at the dawn of the process that put an end to the colonial empires.\n37.\tIt is a strange paradox that our country, which was in the vanguard of the struggle for national independence, should still suffer from a breach of its territorial integrity, an anachronistic persistence of colonialism.\n38.\tThe Malvinas Islands have not been restored to Argentina despite the long interval that has elapsed since the General Assembly adopted resolution 2065 (XX) in 1965. The Malvinas are a colony to this day, with the formal status thereof, basically exploited by a company built on the pattern of those of the time of the mercantile States. Perhaps a unique case in these times of demographic explosion, the Malvinas at present have a population smaller than that which inhabited them at the time of the above mentioned resolution. Large food and energy resources are awaiting exploitation, which is not possible as long as the present illegal occupation continues.\n39.\tThat situation is still less understandable when the islanders have had every practical opportunity of realizing that their association with Argentina is a source of benefits that are otherwise unattainable. Obviously the Malvinas cannot remain a colony, nor can Argentina passively accept that part of its territory should be one of the last colonies. I should like to inform this Assembly that Argentina has addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland a proposal designed to give a decisive impetus to the. negotiations regarding sovereignty over the Malvinas, South Sandwich and South Georgias Islands. The Argentine Republic hopes in due course to be able to report to the General Assembly that the series of negotiations concerning the Malvinas, South Sandwich and South Georgias Islands which we hope will begin soon, has proved to be the last.\n40.\tThe clear awareness that we must have of the serious problems that we face does not hide the enormous capacity of the instruments available to mankind to solve them. The main one among them is the Organization. A single example would suffice to demonstrate the possibilities that open up when the international community works in an organized fashion towards common goals: the success of the intense efforts to ensure the establishment of a just and balanced system to govern the orderly and peaceful use of the oceans and the rational exploitation of their resources.\n41.\tIn that connection, Argentina hopes that the draft convention prepared at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea1 will be adopted in the course of next year and that it will be open for signature in Caracas.\n42.\tThere is no alternative to peace; nor is there any alternative to development. Peace and development require the effort of each and every State forming part of the world community. There is no substitute for our own work, but it is also necessary to have the contribution of everyone. Peace and development presuppose a demand for reason and a Call for moderation. Reason and moderation are the specific instruments of culture and the human condition. They can forestall any threats that hover on the horizon. They can ensure a proper synthesis of the demands of security and the sacred principle of the self determination of peoples. They can also foster the realization that the economic growth of the richest among us is not incompatible with, but rather requires, the development of the poorest among us.\n43.\tIn this world there is no place for lethargy in the struggle for peace or in the development effort. We have reason to hope, not only because there is no alternative but also because the cause is good and just. In the pursuit of those ideals, Argentina identifies with the brotherly peoples of Latin America, whose destiny it shares, whose more active presence in world politics is one of the best assurances of the attainment of the goals of those who gave birth to this Organization* and whose authentic leaders are all men of goodwill."

        "file_text": "I convey to you, Sir, the warm felicitations of my delegation on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. It was a memorable election, not without its drama. We have every confidence that under your dynamic and competent leadership the General Assembly will be able to deal effectively and comprehensively with the many tasks before it.\n2.\tI would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the resolute and efficient leadership provided to the Assembly during its thirty-fifth session by your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar.\n3.\tThe tolerance and patient diplomacy of the Secretary General are well known. I would like to place on record our sincere appreciation of the statesmanlike manner in which he has carried the awesome responsibility of his post.\n4.\tOn behalf of the people and Government of India, I have great pleasure in welcoming Vanuatu and Belize, which have recently achieved their independence and joined the United Nations.\n5.\tThe contours of the world landscape have indeed changed within the past year to such an extent that the shifts and turns make some of us wonder whether international peace and security can at all be preserved intact if the present slide continues. The tension around us is very palpable. Confrontation has become acceptable for bolstering up otherwise sagging egos. Meanwhile, those who are weak and small in terms of defense capability and economic muscle worry about their very survival as free nations. Additional weapons are being injected on a large scale into fragile regimes and areas where tensions are already high. There is a conscious and declared attempt to make relations with the developing countries function of the EastWest variable and to evaluate these relations in terms of the utility factor in the EastWest game. Considerations of the material wellbeing, peace or stability of a country are being subordinated to those of strategic superiority and containment.\n6.\tThe grim international situation is perhaps both the cause and the consequence of the vast inequities and disequilibrium of the world economy. Tfe present structure is so designed and managed as to preserve and perpetuate its oases of privilege and affluence amidst a desert of dearth and deprivation. There is a strange scenario consisting of the economic problems of the developed world caused by what has been called a \\\"system overload\\\" arising from the divergent pulls of economic surplus, deceleration of demand, inflationary spirals and exiguous unemployment on the one hand, and of the grim problem of diminishing economic opportunities faced by the developing countries on the other. It is this dramatic contrast which is in part responsible for the mood of frustration and desperation in the world today. But what is most surprising is that there is an increasing tendency to tackle economic problems through political means. Obviously this will not work in the new context of a world composed of States having sovereign equality but steeped in gaping economic inequalities. No, it is time to realize that there can no longer be political solutions to economic problems.\n7.\tThe pursuit of such a strategy for development can at best be described as misguided and unfortunate. We do not presume to prescribe panaceas to others, but we cannot possibly accept a denial of our own experience, namely, that an unbridled play of the forces of profit and acquisition can lead to concision and anarchy in economic relations. In structurally weaker economies it leads inevitably to an unbalanced allocation of priorities, distorting the social fabric by widening disparities, heightening tensions and leading ultimately to destabilization. Particularly in the developing countries, the State is the main instrument of change and almost the sole repository of power. It would be very unfortunate indeed if State power were employed to support those who are already powerful in the society, resulting in a disequilibrium which inevitably would generate centrifugal forces that would tend to destroy the society itself-. This is already threatening a number of recently emancipated societies. Such societies therefore need a structure wherein State power uncompromisingly stands by the powerless and maintains a balance between the underdog and those who have a long enough reach and strong enough hands to help themselves, no matter what. Within this overall structure there ought to be full scope for individual initiative, entrepreneurship and & civilized, as opposed to anarchic, interaction of market forces. I have no doubt that this logic holds good in international economic relations as well.\n283\nA/36/PV. 15\n8.\tThe Charter of the United Nations is based upon the yearning of mankind for peace and prosperity: peace \nwhich is not merely the absence of a shooting war and prosperity that is not the enrichment of one at the expense of others. We cannot remain indifferent witnesses to the crumbling of detente. The great Powers have long sought security through a balance of mutual vulnerability. Raising the level of deterrence is not going to add any further to their sense of security. Hence a search is on for new strategic partners and allies. I would like to be optimistic, but true optimism invariably has to be based on a realistic and, objective assessment. The determined quest for new political and strategic arrangements on a global scale, with an almost callous disregard for the longterm interests of mankind, does not really leave much room for optimism.\n9.\tWe in India have asked ourselves some basic questions and found some answers to them. The philosophy behind the answers is a simple one and was beautifully articulated by Jawaharlal Nehru in a broadcast he made to the United States of America on 3 April 1948 from New Delhi. It was entitled \\\"The Age of Crisis\\\". He said:\n\\\"Today, fear consumes us all fear of the future, fear of war, fear of the peoples of the nations we dislike and those who dislike us . . . But fear is an ignoble emotion and leads to blind strife. Let us try to get rid of this fear . . . and then gradually the crisis of the spirit will be resolved, the dark clouds that surround us may lift and the way to the evolution of the world based or. freedom will be clear.\\\"\n10.\tIt is against this background that we see the destiny of India, both within, and in the world, more especially in our own region. Within India the reaffirmation of the policies set out by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has been accompanied by a renewed dedication to national reconstruction and the consolidation of a secular and pluralistic political system. The stresses and strains of the international economy have impinged upon various aspects of our own economic growth but have not shaken the self- confidence of our people. Our dedication to our chosen objectives, especially to self-reliance, remains undiminished. If the successful inauguration of the APPLE geostationary satellite by our scientists represents one frontier of India's efforts and achievements, the harnessing of animal power through redesigning the bullock cart or the grinding wheel is symbolic of another equally relevant application of technology.\n11.\tOur self-reliance consists in trying to find solutions to our problems primarily according to our own genius. Our problems are basically simple food, clothing, shelter, health and education. It is their sheer magnitude that is baffling, not their complexity. There are no psychosomatic ailments, no paranoia of any kind afflicting us. We will therefore persevere, in our massive effort to lift ourselves up as a whole mass and not piecemeal, using methods and technology most relevant to our situation, ringing from the most sophisticated to the most simple, neglecting nothing useful because of its plainness, taking nothing irrelevant because of its dazzle. I am sure that many more developing countries now accept this pattern and that some of them have arrived at it by the circuitous and hard route of disillusionment arising from inappropriate models.\n12.\tIndia's relations with its neighbors are based on a recognition of the fact that the interests of the countries are so linked that there is no reason for us to be on any terms other than friendly. These relations are based on sovereign equality, a recognition of mutuality of interests and mutuality of perceptions to the extent possible. Where this mutuality does not obtain there is no undue keenness whatsoever to impose unwanted identities on one another. Whatever the depth of relationship at a given time, our sole interest is in promoting an environment of peace and stability that will enable all countries of the region to engage in fruitful development endeavors, avoiding outside influences.\n13.\tSome constructive steps in the direction of strengthening regional cooperation among the States of South Asia have been considered. We are confident that, given a sense of realism and the requisite political will, such cooperation would be feasible in advancing the development of the countries in this region. I would like to pay a special tribute to the wisdom and foresight of former President ZiaurRahman of Bangladesh for his dedicated efforts in this direction.\n14.\tAll countries in our region face similar economic problems, and we should devote our energies towards development and development alone. India wants to have strong and self-reliant neighbors, since we are convinced that this alone is in our interest. We are, however, gravely concerned by the deteriorating security environment in our region. While India does not find itself- helpless in any way, we view with deep concern the possibility of the strategic calculations of outside Powers engulfing countries in our region.\n15.\tWe are committed to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We are committed to the principles of nonalignment. Our twin commitments in the field of foreign policy are based on the objective necessity to contribute in a positive manner towards the creation of a peaceful and cooperative world. In India today, I am glad to say, there is complete unanimity regarding the content and relevance of the policy of nonalignment and the principles of Pancha Shila. Our commitment to nonalignment has made us unafraid to stand by ourselves, if need be, on our own conviction, whenever a point of principle is involved.\n16.\tMore than two decades ago Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru spoke of the threat of the cold war coming to our doorstep. After a slight letup, this threat seems once again to have come back today. IWenty years since its inception, the nonaligned movement once again faces a situation which calls for the utmost ingenuity and pure purposefulness. However, despite the changes in the environment tending to exert pressure on the movement itself-, the nonaligned countries can still bring a semblance of sanity in international relations. No one has claimed or should ever claim that the nonaligned movement is a monolith. Its resilience and effectiveness, which unfortunately seem to be lost on some, are being recognized by more and more countries. It is not for nothing that every new independent nation promptly joins the nonaligned; the delicate plant of nascent freedom needs a nonaligned climate in order to grow and find its identity. Alignment saps it; alliances spell blight for it. It is a happy augury, both for the movement and for humanity as a whole, that on an increasingly large number of issues, such as decolonization, rejection of apartheid, the Middle East question, more equitable international economic relations, global interdependence and, we hope, many others that will emerge in due course, there has come about an identity of views between the nonaligned and several non non-aligned countries. We fervently hope that both the trend and the tribe will increase to a point where alignment ceases to be either fashionable or profitable.\n17.\tI shall now briefly refer to some of the world's unresolved problems, whose number unfortunately tends only to increase with each succeeding session of the General Assembly. The most important of the problems is, of course, the very survival of mankind.\n18.\tNothing proves the unreality and mockery of international politics today so much as the failure of all attempts at disarmament. Despite this unreality, the world cannot afford to ignore the fateful implications of the arms race, particularly in its nuclear aspects, for the very future of life on this planet. Along with increasing levels of sophistication, new claims are being made regarding the possibility of waging \\\"winnable\\\" wars. On top of everything, we now have the neutron weapons. This development will set the stage for a qualitative jump in the nuclear arms race. While the Governments of the nuclear weapon States ostensibly practice deterrence, the choice which they are presenting their own people with seems to be one of death by their own bombs or by those of the enemy. Most certainly, it is not a choice between death and survival. I have no doubt that in spite of the intense psychosis created by these Governments in a variety of ways the people of the nuclear weapon States themselves feel disaster in their bones all the time. It is time that this feeling finds increasing articulation and leads to active opposition before it is too late. It goes without saying that for the rest of mankind this is a matter of the greatest concern. The world cannot afford to permit any State or States to endanger the survival of a)I mankind. peace-loving States should assume, in a more strident manner, the moral responsibility to urge nuclear disarmament on a high priority basis.\n19.\tThe nonaligned countries have clearly and consistently stressed the primacy of their concern about nuclear issues. We are aware that each time there is a move to modernize a weapons system on one side, a corresponding mirror image action is taken by the other, resulting in the escalation of fear, anxiety and suspicion in the whole world. Each upward spiral in the arms race becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is our sincere belief that this vicious cycle of action and response can be broken. We hope that the dialog between the United States and the USSR which has just started will result in genuine and practical measures to give a fresh start in this respect. Meanwhile the world waits with bated breath, teetering on the brink of disaster.\n20.\tThe Indian Ocean is another theater witnessing a great accumulation of sophisticated military hardware. This is in flagrant violation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace adopted in 1971 [resolution 2832(XXVI)], in which the General Assembly expressed opposition to the military presence of the great Powers in the context of their rivalry and calls for its elimination. There is an effort to divide the littoral and hinterland States. Arguments are being improvised to justify greatPower presences in the Indian Ocean area. There is a need for determined efforts to stop these moves, which ruin our security environment. Further, it needs to be reiterated that greatPower presences in the\nIndian Ocean are unacceptable not only in the context of their rivalry but under any circumstances whatsoever. Were they to agree among themselves to stay put in this Ocean they would still be equally unwelcome. Together or separately, we want them out.\n21.\tIndia has consistently expressed its disapproval of all kinds of outside intervention and interference in any country. We have unequivocally opposed the presence of foreign troops in any country and all countries. For us this includes Afghanistan, whereas, presumably, to some other countries this should apply only to Afghanistan, A running argument has ensued on this question, and those who started with condemnatory polemics have now come round to prefer a political solution on the lines of the New Delhi Declaration adopted by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of NonAligned Countries last February [see AI36I116 and Corr.l, annexJ, The Secretary-General is now considering the question and is currently engaged in removing the cobwebs to enable a dialog between the countries concerned. We wish him well in this quest. Meanwhile, the people of Afghanistan can only hope devoutly that the SecretaryGeneral's efforts may succeed; they have such a large stake in his success.\n22.\tThe people and Government of India are saddened by the continuation of the conflict between Iran and Iraq. This conflict has taken a heavy toll in life and property, leading inevitably to the retardation of developmental activities of both these nonaligned countries. On their part, the nonaligned have attempted to find an acceptable solution to the conflict and will continue their efforts in consonance with the mandate of the New Delhi Declaration.\n23.\tIndia's ties with the countries of SouthEast Asia are based upon the closest social, cultural and intellectual links developed over the centuries. Having supported them in their struggle for independence, we cannot but be deeply interested in the developments in this region, particularly those affecting international peace and security in our own neighborhood. We continue to be prepared to join in all constructive efforts aimed at seeking a peaceful solution to the problems of the region.\n24.\tThe people of Kampuchea have only just begun to emerge from the holocaust visited upon them by the Pol Pot regime in addition to the privations they had to endure earlier during the struggle of the peoples of IndoChina for national liberation, independence and sovereignty. They have just begun to look to the future with a semblance of hope and expectation. The prospects of famine and disease have receded. At this stage, the effort of the outside world should be to reassure the Kampuchean people that the process they have embarked upon will not be reversed and that their erstwhile persecutors will never be allowed to return and unleash once again a reign of terror upon them. It is, therefore, a great irony of the times that the same despotic regime should bring the stench of their genocidal acts into this august chamber in order to represent, as it were, their own victims in a bizarre inversion of the principles of the Charter. We still hope that before long wiser counsels will prevail. Indeed, at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs at New Delhi, it was clearly underlined that a comprehensive political solution should be found, providing for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and ensuring full respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all \nStates in the region, including Kampuchea. The interference and intervention of outside Powers in the region have exacerbated tensions and must be eliminated. We are convinced that this can be achieved only through a dialog between the countries of the region.\n2$. The political situation in West Asia continues to smolder as a result of Israel's adventurism and intransigence. If anything, it has been rendered more serious by IsraeKs arrogation to itself- of the right to launch \\\"preemptive\\\" attacks against its neighbors, as happened recently in southern Lebanon, on the spurious pretext of safeguarding its own security. Similarly, the 7 June attack on and destruction of the Osirak atomic reactor by Israel F16 aircraft a reactor known to have been intended entirely for peaceful purposes was an example of blatant aggression.\n26.\tA just and comprehensive solution of the West Asian problem can be achieved only by ensuring the total and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from Arab territories occupied since 1967, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable national right to self-determination, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, as well as the recognition of the right of all States in the area to live within recognized and secure boundaries. Such a peaceful solution cannot be attained without the full and equal participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people, in any settlement or negotiating process. We have already seen convincing evidence of the failure of a partial solution undertaken without the participation of the PLO.\n27.\tThe recent emergency special session on Namibia has served to focus the attention of the international community on the grave situation in southern Africa. The credibility of the United Nations will be seriously eroded if it is unable to secure freedom and justice for the people of Namibia. Only through an early implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) could the peaceful decolonization of Namibia be achieved. All attempts to dilute, modify or attenuate the details of the United Nations plan to which that resolution refers for any further purpose are unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of world opinion. The Government of India reiterates its full solidarity with the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] as the authentic representative of the Namibian people and will continue to extend moral and material support to it in its struggle for national liberation.\n28.\tWe had all hoped last year that the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea would successfully finalize a comprehensive, convention. However, the Conference has since met twice and our hope has not yet been fulfilled. The Government of India is deeply concerned that the efforts of the Conference have been frustrated, creating uncertainty about its future. Some 150 countries have labored hard for over eight years to arrive at an acceptable compromise package relating to the law of the sea which, in our opinion, serves the best interests of the community of nations as a whole. In this era of multilateral interdependence, national interests of one country cannot override the overwhelming interests of the entire international community. The resources of the international seabed area have been proclaimed the common heritage of mankind. An orderly and safe development and rational management of these resources for the benefit of mankind as a whole are imperative necessities. We do hope that the Conference will successfully complete its task at Caracas in September 1982, without reopening any of the issues already settled.\n29.\tAll of us, each in a different way, have found that peace is stable only when prosperity is equitably shared. Mutatis mutandis, the same is equally true in the context of our global village, this little earth of ours. What are the mechanisms to be evolved so that the worthwhile things in life are within everyone's reach? That is what all of us are striving for in building a new international economic order in which production expands, labor is shared, and the products of labor are available to all, without pockets of misery or wasteful pockets of surpluses.\n30.\tWhile there may be no simple solution to the global economic crisis, the erosion of a multilateral framework will certainly make the situation much worse. A withdrawal from the processes of international cooperation is bound to lead to increasing recourse to bilateralism. This was not the vision of the founding fathers of the Charter of the United Nations, to which every speaker before me has expressed an unqualified commitment. Total bilateralism at the expense of multilateral cooperation would run into alliances that may not be in the interest of harmonious relations and relaxation of tensions.\n31.\tThe attempts to erode the multilateral framework of economic cooperation appear even more indefensible in view of the rapid and continuing aggravation of the economic situation of most developing countries. Their terms of trade have further declined, and their exports have faced the rising walls of protectionism erected by several powerful industrialized countries. Food and energy have become more scarce. Balance of payments deficits are growing alarmingly, and external debt is assuming unmanageable proportions.\n32.\tDeveloping countries are unable to improve their terms of trade when the wall of protectionism keeps rising in one form or another in response to every innovation that they make. Access to capital markets is practically blocked through artificially inflated interest rates. The result of all these phenomena, which are manipulated by a few centers of economic power and over which the developing countries have no control, becomes manifest in sluggish economic activity at home and further aggravates balance of payments and debt burdens. \n33.\tClosely linked to this process is the role of the international financial institutions. Only a few months ago, at the second regular session for 1981 of the Economic and Social Council, we welcomed the many innovative mechanisms evolved by these institutions, making it possible for larger financial resources to become available to developing countries. I must note with some regret, however, that even while more rigorous conditionality has been maintained some of the progressive mechanisms of lending by these institutions have come into question in recent months. After the tremendous effort during the past decade to impart a greater and more effective developmental role to these institutions, this retrograde trend is most unfortunate. I would like to express my strong conviction that the achievements of the past decade and the progress made in making these institutions more responsive to the needs of the developing countries should not be reversed or eroded.\n34.\tI would also hope that the United Nations system will sincerely take serious measures to implement the policy measures defined in the International Development Strategy so that the goals and objectives of the Third United Nations Development Decade [resolution 35/56] are attained. The Strategy was adopted by consensus, and its goals and objectives are modest. If there is sincerity about interdependence, these modest goals should not be difficult to achieve.\n35.\tThe Caracas high level conference of the Group of 77 made progress in a pragmatic manner in the field of economic cooperation amongst the developing countries. The attitude of the developed countries towards technical cooperation amongst the developing countries has not been negative, though not exactly enthusiastic. In both the SouthSouth and the NorthSouth context a number of proposals designed to alleviate the burden of oil-importing developing countries have been under consideration. It is necessary to devise an early action oriented program to solve this important problem in its various aspects. This has perhaps been delayed because of the failure to launch the global negotiations. The energy resources of the developing countries can be developed on the basis of a definitive expansion of the multilateral flow of public finances, about which interesting ideas have been adumbrated, including that of an energy affiliate of the World Bank. Both the objective and the urgency of these steps need to be underscored.\n36.\tOne of the major obstacles to a meaningful North South dialog so far is the widespread impression that on issues of resources and technology transfer it is the South that needs the North, without having much to offer in return. This is not a correct reflection of the situation. The intimate dependence of the economies of the North on world markets makes it impossible for them, as the Brandt Commission notes in its report to put even their own house in order if they forget the rest of the world. This is the lesson of the 1980s, which the North could ignore only at its own peril.\n37.\tWe would like to reiterate, therefore, that the international community should face squarely the reality of interdependence among nations. The benefits of strengthened international economic cooperation and the dangers inherent in the growing tendency towards isolation and protectionism need to be realized more in practice. This should be reflected in the full participation by all developed countries in the process of solving international economic issues in the context of NorthSouth cooperation. There can be no exception or reservations to this process or any ground whatsoever historical, ideological or merely rhetorical. While the task of apportioning blame should now appropriately belong to academic endeavor, all developed countries should put their shoulders to the wheel.\n38.\tWhile saying this I am not underestimating the difficulties that willing Governments of the North would face in convincing their own people of the fact of interdependence in terms intelligible to the members of a self-solicitous affluent society. The realization that the purchase of the next automobile by one family in a developed country would be truly dependent on the availability of the next meal to another, starving family in a developing country is not easy to induce. Yet this is precisely the core of the concept of interdependence. The ancient Indian dictum which treats the whole world as one family seems to be on the verge of complete vindication in a very different context which none of the ancient sages had perhaps anticipated. Ancient intuition and modern scientific experience find a strange coincidence at this point.\n39.\tLet there be no mistake. The United Nations, being the largest multilateral system, must have the capacity to provide the umbrella under which the urgent and complex task of restructuring international economic relations could and should be undertaken. From an almost purely political institution, the system has gradually come to grapple with complex economic issues lying in the bowels of international relations today. A successful launching of the global negotiations on major economic issues and a coherent and integrated framework in the spirit of mutual benefit will constitute the real success of the United Nations system. We reiterate, therefore, that this process should be started without further delay.\n40.\tWe are today on the eve of the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held at Cancun, which will bring together leaders of some developed and developing countries to enable a better understanding of each other's perceptions, achieve a real meeting of minds and generate the requisite political impetus to make hopefully a determined assault on all questions concerning international economic relations. The growing frustration and cynicism generated over the years by frequent setbacks to every NorthSouth exercise represent a dangerous trend. We, for our part, will continue our serious commitment to work tirelessly and ceaselessly to reverse this trend. We wish god-speed to the Cancun conclave.\n41.\tIn the course of the general debate so far, we have heard several statements which rekindle one's faith in the desire of the North to engage in a mutually advantageous dialog with the South. I was particularly heartened by the question posed by the Minister for External Relations of France in his statement before the General Assembly on 23 September where he said: \\\"But how often do you hear it . acknowledged . . . that the progress of the North South dialog is a prerequisite for world progress and perhaps even for world peace?\\\" [9th meeting, para. 26.] He himself- provided the answer with characteristic finesse: \\\"The South has become part of the life of the North.\\\" [Ibid, para. 27.)\n42.\tI would like to join wholeheartedly in this statement, as well as in similar inspiring statements made by several colleagues from other developed countries. These pronouncements are indeed refreshing trend-setters, inasmuch as they seek to demolish the hitherto impregnable NorthSouth divide. North and South must, therefore, share the same objectives, as their destinies are intertwined. Together, we can make sure that while following our paths, we can contribute to each other's prosperity as well as security, provided we follow the logic of peaceful cooperation and steer clear of the twin mistakes of isolation and confrontation.\n\n"

        "file_text": "254.\t Mr. President, allow me at the outset to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. You bring to that office an uncommonly solid and variegated experience of work in and for the United Nations. I have every confidence that the Assembly will be most competently guided.\n255.\tI wish also to join in the tributes paid by other speakers to the outstanding and tireless work of the President of the thirty-fifth session, Mr. von Wechmar.\n256.\tOur thanks and appreciation go also to the Secretary-General for his tireless work in the service of the Organization and in the pursuit of solutions to many of the most intractable problems facing the international community.\n257.. Let me also welcome the most recent Member of the United Nations, Vanuatu. The admission of this new nation to the Organization brings us a step closer to the goal of complete decolonization and the United Nations ideal of universality.\n258. Since the previous session of the General Assembly the international climate has deteriorated even further. Detente has, to an increasing extent, been replaced by distrust. Some features of the situation certainly remind us of the days of the cold war. Once again we see the foreign policy of the Super-Powers being dominated by the fear that one adversary might gain, either directly or indirectly, an advantage over the other. Once again, they both seem inclined to view local conflicts and problems primarily in the light of the struggle for power between the two systems they represent. Once again they both seem to fear that the opponent is on the verge of acquiring military superiority. Both see the actions of the opposite side as threats to their own security. Neither sees its own actions as threats against the other side.\n259.\tThe struggle of the Super-Powers to rectify the perceived imbalances in some areas, or to compensate for them by attempts to achieve superiority in others, leads to increased insecurity for all of us. By reason of their nuclear arsenals, the two Super-Powers hold the fate of the entire world in their hands. Therefore, every State has the right to demand that the Super-Powers maintain a stable pattern of contacts in order to avoid misunderstandings and overreactions. We therefore welcome the fact that the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States are using the occasion of this session of the General Assembly to hold bilateral meetings.\n260.\tHowever, we cannot rest content with the resumption of the necessary dialog between the two Super-Powers. We must call upon them to review and reconsider the course their global actions have taken, the most dangerous dimension of which is the nuclear arms race. The negotiations on theater nuclear forces in Europe, which are now scheduled to begin later this year, should have been commenced long ago.\n261.\tFour years have passed since the Soviet Union started deploying a new medium-range ballistic missile, the SS20, and two years since NATO decided to install new medium-range nuclear missiles on West European soil. It is reported that more than 300 SS20s have already been deployed and that at least two thirds of them may be targeted on Western Europe.\n262.\tThe recent decision of the United States to produce the neutron weapon constitutes a further dangerous escalation of the nuclear arms race between the Super-Powers. It is therefore high time for the Super-Powers to sit down at the negotiating table and agree on measures to restrain the arms race and reduce the risk of war. No category of weapons should be excluded from negotiations, but we urge the Super-Powers in particular to resume in the near future their talks on limitations and reductions of strategic arms.\n263.\tThat demand is supported by a wave of popular protests in Western Europe against nuclear armaments. All slogans are not as unbiased as they may seem and some ideas put forward may be less realistic than others, but in general the protests against nuclear weapons must be seen as an expression of a genuine and legitimate concern about what people feel is the lunacy of the nuclear arms race and the incapacity of political leaders to do anything about it.\n264.\tAll human beings yearn for peace, no matter in what country they live. The fact that there is no freedom of expression in some countries should not diminish the importance of popular protests in countries where such freedom can be enjoyed. Nor should the fact that some devote more and more attention to planning for the eventuality of war prevent others from dedicating themselves to planning for peace. Every region and every country, no matter how small, has the right and the duty to interfere in international affairs for the sake of peace.\n265.\tIn the northern region of Europe the desire to uphold the vision of a more peaceful world has been reflected in the idea of establishing a Nordic nuclear weapon-free zone. The active discussion on this idea can be seen as an expression of strong concern over the intensified nuclear arms race in Europe and as a demonstration of the strong desire of the Nordic peoples to maintain the low level of tension in our part of the world\\\".\n266.\tMy Government is in favor of exploring the possibilities of establishing a Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone and the conditions under which such a zone could improve the already existing stable pattern of Nordic security. As the Nordic countries do not have nuclear weapons, such an improvement would, in the view of my Government, have to include concessions from the Soviet Union and the United States as regards nuclear weapons relevant to the Nordic region.\n267.\tSo far the United States has not been willing to consider a Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone.\n268.\tThe Soviet Union has suggested that it subscribes to the idea. It has also hinted that it could consider concessions relating to its own territory. However, what has been said so far has been more than vague. If we are to have a meaningful debate, further clarifications from the Soviet Union are necessary as to what concessions it has in mind.\n269.\tWorld peace is not something to be discussed exclusively in closed sessions between the major Powers. All States should be given the possibility of making their voices heard on matters which relate to their security and to world peace. This is. the idea behind the proposal to convene a conference on confidence and security-building measures and disarmament in Europe with the participation of the Soviet Union and the United States.\n270.\tMany States not least, neutral and nonaligned countries in Europe are working hard towards this goal at the current follow-up meeting in Madrid of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n271.\tA conference on confidence-building and security building measures and disarmament in Europe, held in successive stages, could result in the adoption of new confidence-building and security-building measures as well as progress towards limitation of nuclear and conventional weapons. Concrete, practical results of a first stage of the conference would certainly be conducive to a situation where meaningful negotiations on disarmament proper in Europe could be initiated. The conference could thus also promote progress towards a military balance between the two alliances at substantially lower armament levels.\n272.\tThe Super-Powers may have differing views on many of these and other issues discussed at the Madrid meeting, but they must not forget that the preservation of the process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is in their common interest. They must therefore mobilize the political will for the adjustments and compromises necessary for reaching a substantial and balanced result in Madrid covering all fields of the Final Act of Helsinki.\n273.\tIt is important that we develop the contents of the Final Act of Helsinki with new initiatives. It is just as important that we uphold respect for the principles already enshrined in that very Act. The Helsinki Act reaffirms the right of every State to territorial integrity, freedom and independence. Any interference in the internal affairs of another State, as well as any use or threat of force, is a breach of the principles that direct cooperation between the States of Europe.\n274.\tThese solemnly worded principles also apply to Poland. During the last year we have witnessed a promising development towards the implementation of certain fundamental democratic rights in Poland. However, at the same time and with increasing concern, we have noted the open and brutal demands of the Soviet Union that the trends in Poland be turned back. We see no reason why an internal political process in Poland should cause its greatPower neighbor to make menacing statements. On the contrary, we see strong reasons why the Poles should be allowed to determine their own future without any foreign interference.\n275.\tThe Charter of the United Nations bestows no mandate on the great Powers to impose their will on smaller nations. On the contrary, the Charter confers greater responsibilities on the great Powers as guardians of international peace.\n276.\tRegional conflicts throughout the world can easily escalate to a confrontation between the Super-Powers and become a threat to world peace.\n277.\tIn southern Africa, the. Pretoria regime, emboldened by the regional strategic concepts recently put forward by the United States, has escalated its attacks against its neighbors, Angola in particular, in flagrant violation of international law.\n278.\tThe internal developments in South Africa are also ominous. The vague talk of reforming the apartheid system has served only, as I see it, as an attempt to mislead the critics of apartheid. In reality, the system has remained as rigid as ever. The human degradation in which the majority of the country's population still has to live is surpassed only by the human, and indeed moral, degradation of the regime itself. But despite the efforts of the regime to silence trade unions, writers, students, churches and other civic groups, opposition is obviously stiffening. Events now taking place in the country could eventually lead to a violent showdown.\n279.\tEvery nation deVoted to democratic ideals and human rights should strive for the abolition of the apartheid system. No democracy should support a system which violates the very idea of democracy itself. It is now high time that massive world opinion be reflected in firm demands that South Africa finally cooperate in implementing the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978). None of the five Western Powers with special responsibility for implementing this plan must through its own actions give Pretoria the impression that the demands that the South African regime end its illegal occupation of Namibia are not seriously meant.\n280.\tIn this process the Security Council must, as Sweden has repeatedly stated, be prepared to impose sanctions against South Africa. This may be the only language South Africa understands.\n281.\tSouthWest Asia is another area where tension is reaching a dangerous level. The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, the war between Iran and Iraq,, the terror and bloodshed in Iran, the conflict between Israel and the\nArabs, the increased American and Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean, the arms flow to that region, the social and political unrest, the economic and strategic importance of the Middle East and Gulf region all these factors combine to make this part of the world a powder keg. What is needed in that region is not more violence, not more terror, not more bombing, not more violations of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, but more efforts for peace.\n282.\tThe Soviet armed intervention in Afghanistan continues, however, in open contempt both of massive world opinion and of the Charter. The only results the Soviet troops have achieved are increased international tension and instability. Popular resistance to the invaders is as vigorous as ever and shows that a lasting solution of the Afghanistan problem can be found only when foreign interference has ceased.\n283.\tIn the Middle East two adversaries, Israel and the PLO, stand face to face. We urge them to recognize each other and start negotiating for peace. This is to say that the PLO must recognize Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries. This is also to say that Israel must recognize the legitimate national rights of the Palestinians, including their right to establish, should they so wish, a State of their own, living in peace side by side with Israel. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), supplemented by an endorsement of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinians, remain the basis for a peaceful solution to the Middle East problem.\n284.\tWhen Israel recently attacked Lebanon, causing many casualties among Palestinians as well as Lebanese, the United States took prompt and decisive diplomatic action and was able to contribute to a ceasefire. However precarious that ceasefire may be, it represents a welcome attempt to set in motion the difficult process of peace with the involvement of all the parties concerned.\n285.\tWe also welcome the fact that further steps have been taken in preparation for the final withdrawal in April 1982 of Israeli forces from the occupied areas of Sinai. A dismantling of the Israeli settlements on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip would be a constructive next step. Human rights in the occupied territories must be observed in a way that is compatible with Israel's tradition of democracy and the rule of law.\n286.\tIn the Middle bast me price of inaction might be very high. The mere lack of initiatives for peace constitutes in itself a danger. If no progress is seen towards solving the crucial Palestinian question, bitterness and hostility will deepen and tension rise. In few other regions of the world is it therefore as important to maintain the momentum for peace through initiatives to implement the resolutions of the Security Council.\n287.\tThe war between Iran and Iraq has now lasted a whole year. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and destruction is widespread. The economic development of both Iran and Iraq is being hindered by the continuation of the conflict. The efforts of the United Nations in sending the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Olof Palme, to help lead the parties onto a course of peaceful settlement have the wholehearted support of the Swedish Government. The parties should explore every possibility for a negotiated settlement, based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, via an impartial third party.\n288.\tIn IndoChina, shattered by decades of war, peace is being sacrificed to the attempts of some States to gain regional power and to the strategic ambitions of the great Powers. The Swedish Government has given its support to United Nations efforts to find a political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We regret that Viet Nam did not choose to take part in the International Conference on Kampuchea, since a dialog between the parties to the conflict could create a favorable political climate necessary for a solution. Every avenue should be explored for the bringing about of such a dialog with the participation of all the parties concerned.\n289.\tBoth the Heng Samrin regime installed by Viet Nam and the earlier Pol Pot regime claim the right to rule over the people of Kampuchea. Sweden regards neither of these regimes as the legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people. An acceptable settlement of the conflict must include the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the restoration to the Kampuchean people of its right to self determination. In our view, it is open to question whether the continued recognition of the Pol Pot regime by the United Nations is not an obstacle to a solution of the Kampucheain problem within the framework of the United Nations.\n2 1 Few people have fought so hard and so long for self-determination as have the Vietnamese. It is a tragic irony that Viet Nam now seems unable to recognize that same fundamental right when it comes to the sorely afflicted people of Kampuchea.\n29 i. Another nation urgently in need of peace is El Salvador, More than 20,000 people have been killed in the civil war raging in that unfortunate country. The opposition in El Salvador has declared that it is willing to negotiate in order to arrive at a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Sweden has long advocated the idea of a negotiated settlement, and we note with satisfaction that this idea is gaining in international support. A negotiated settlement which establishes a ceasefire and a coalition Government in control of the army and the guerrilla forces would make peace and democracy possible.\n\n292.\tThe struggle in El Salvador is a struggle between a prevailing oligarchy and the demands of the people for greater justice. In the final analysis it is in this conflict that the democracies of the world have to choose sides.\n293.\tEl Salvador is not only a country with a high level of political violence. It is also one of the many poor nations of the world. Just as violent upheavals in many countries have their origins in deep economic and social injustices, so the widening gap between the rich and the poor countries may ultimately lead to international conflicts.\n294.\tOne fifth of mankind is living on the margin of existence, in hunger, unemployment and illness and without adequate shelter. This is intolerable from the point of view of human solidarity and, in the long run, incompatible with world peace and stability.\n295.\tThe crying needs exist, not only because resources are limited or not fully used, but also because the resources available are expended in an unwise and unjust way. The sums that the world spends for military purposes exceed the total income of that half of mankind which lives in low-income countries. The per capita consumption of energy in the industrialized countries, one of the most vital world resources, is 120 times as high as in the least -developed countries.\n296.\tIn a month's time a summit meeting on North South questions will be held in Mexico. It is not intended to take the place of global negotiations within the framework of the United Nations, but Sweden hopes that the meeting will give the necessary political impetus to break the present deadlock and set the NorthSouth dialog in motion. We trust that it will identify so many areas of common interest that a global round of negotiations will be unanimously agreed upon and launched at this session of the General Assembly.\n297.\tThere are a few areas where mutual interests dictate joint discussions.\n298.\tThe first concerns food security. No question can be more vital than how to work out policies and measures that ensure sufficient food for all mankind. Such discussions must deal with short-term disaster measures as well as longer-term policies to stimulate food production on a sustainable basis.\n299.\tSecondly, action concerning commodities, trade and industrialization is necessary. Growth in international trade is of mutual interest to developing and industrialized countries. Resistance to protectionism is therefore a necessity.\n300.\tThirdly, we know that a serious international disequilibrium exists, with pressing balance of payments problems for many countries. Concerted efforts are therefore needed which aim at curbing inflation and unemployment and at increasing the transfer of resources. The establishment of an energy affiliate attached to the World Bank would be an important and constructive measure.\n301.\tFourthly, and finally, the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy has recently stressed the necessity of expediting the transition from oil to alternative sources of energy. It also pointed to the risks of a too intensive exploitation of firewood and charcoal in developing countries. Continued stimulation of conservation and efficient use of all forms of energy are needed. Stable and predictable market developments are in the interest of all countries.\n302.\tThe idea of having a global round of negotiations is based on the knowledge that all countries, whether rich or poor, would benefit from international economic cooperation.\n303.\tThe demand is there. The developing countries have an enormous need for imported goods for the development of their resources and infrastructures. The human resources are there. Millions of people are unemployed in the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The capital is also there. Oil production has created a vast surplus of capital in search of a productive use.\n304.\tWhat is lacking is the imagination and the political will to utilize the potentials available and to turn the problems into possibilities. This will can be mobilized only if we increase the awareness among political leaders and among the public that development cooperation is a matter of survival, not of charity, and that the North in the wider perspective is just as dependent on the South as the South is on the North. Solidarity between the two will mean better chances of survival for both.\n305.\tIn the present tense world climate it is more important than ever that we vigorously defend the principles of self-determination, territorial integrity, the non-use of force or the threat of force and respect for human rights. These principles are equally applicable to conditions in East and West, North and South. The rights of peoples or individuals must be protected whether they live in Afghanistan, El Salvador, Kampuchea, Namibia, Poland or any other country. We cannot accept the suppression of fundamental human rights or the erosion of the principle of self-determination in the name of any ideology or for the protection of any strategic interests.\n306.\tIn the nuclear age the risks involved in any great Power conflict are immeasurable. That is why we must not let tension grow to a point where the process of escalation can no longer be controlled. That is why we demand a halt to the arms race between the Super-Powers. That is why we urge the Super-Powers to start spending for development instead of spending for destruction. That is why we urge the Super-Powers to reconsider the course their actions have taken in Asia, the Middle East, southern Africa and Latin America. In many of these areas the present policies of the Super-Powers combine to heighten the risks of war. In all those areas the principles of the Charter of the United Nations provide the guidelines for peace.\n"

        "file_name": "JOR_36_1981.txt",
        "file_text": "Sir, I should like first to express my sincere congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. That election is a sign of the high regard in which your personal accomplishments are held and of your country's important role in strengthening international understanding and in cementing genuine cooperation among nations. I am confident that your contribution to the achievement of a positive outcome to the deliberations of this session will be enhanced by your personal qualities and wide experience.\n93.\tI wish also to express my thanks and appreciation for the efforts of your predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, of the Federal Republic of Germany, which is bound to my own country, Jordan, by strong bonds of friendship, mutual respect and cooperation. His valuable contribution as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session helped significantly to foster the atmosphere of positive dialog which characterized the work of the session.\n94.\tIt also gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the considerable efforts of the SecretaryGeneral aimed at lessening global tensions and increasing the chances for peace in all parts of the world.\n95.\tIt is also my pleasure on this occasion to express our warm congratulations to Belize and Vanuatu on their accession to independence and to membership in the international family of nations, which associates them with the creation of a better international community in which peace and prosperity prevail.\n96.\tA close examination of the current world situation clearly reveals a divergence between the commonly shared hopes for a world ruled by peace and justice and the existing reality, where power rules and the politics of fait accompli dominate.\n97.\tThere are countries which feel justified in adopting a policy based on the creation of spheres of influence and the use of power politics for solving problems-. That is due partly to the lack of moral content in their decision-making process. Absence of moral' commitment to seek security through peaceful means increases the dependence of those Powers on the enlargement of their arsenals of destructive weapons. The search for an unattainable absolute security makes those countries forget that absolute security for some means lack of security for others.\n98.\tThe arms race, which involves vast world expenditures averaging $450 billion annually, very seriously increases tension. It forces many developing countries to allocate huge segments of their limited incomes for defense purposes at the expense of their economic and social development.\n99.\tDisarmament is basic and vital to world security and peace. We appreciate all the efforts and resolutions adopted and implemented in that field by the United Nations in past years. We all hope that at the second special session devoted to disarmament, to be held next year, the General Assembly will achieve substantial progress in that area. It would protect humanity from a grave danger and would safeguard developing countries against being drawn into conflicts and struggles for influence which threaten their very existence and survival.\n100.\tHere I am referring in particular to the dangers that threaten our Middle East region as a result of Israel's accumulation of a major arsenal of both conventional and nuclear weapons. Items 46 and 56 of the agenda of this session are concerned, respectively, with the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and the dangers stemming from Israeli nuclear armament.\n101.\tConsideration of those items in the Assembly is an indication that we have realized the dimensions of the danger threatening the Middle East because of nuclear armament by Israel aimed at imposing hegemony through aggression in the region. Israel has refused to sign the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has further refused to allow the specialized international organizations concerned to inspect its nuclear installations. We in the Middle East regard the United Nations and the Charter as the proper framework within which should fall any arrangement for making the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Such a step should lead to the halting of the Israeli nuclear program, with its sinister objectives, saving the region from the horrors of the use of these destructive weapons.\n102.\tThe second important issue for the present and the future of the contemporary world is the creation of a new and more just international economic order which would conform to the aspirations of a majority of the peoples of the world and which would contribute to raising their standard of living. It is clear that the problems facing international economic relations have reached such a critical stage, as Jordan pointed out to the Assembly in the previous session [25th meeting], that the very survival and continuation of the human race depend on their speedy solution.\n103.\tAn objective view clearly reveals that poverty, ignorance and disease are rife in many communities, as well as drought that regularly threatens life in many nations in Asia and Africa. The dangers caused by this situation and its tragic human dimension have failed to move the political will of the rich nations adequately to confront these challenges.. They have also fallen far short of creating the basis for a new moral order based on justice, fair treatment and cooperation among nations.\n,104. My country is conscious of the essential role the United Nations should play in evolving a major change in present international economic relations. We need to develop criteria to regulate international relations on an equitable basis for an acceptable pattern of world trade. It is unfair that developing countries have to import industrialized goods at ever rising prices, while they sell their raw materials at comparatively lower prices.\n105.\tThe situation also calls for an immediate solution to the energy problem and the spiraling costs involved. The United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held last August at Nairobi, constituted the first concrete step towards dealing with this very important issue. It highlighted the need to provide sources of energy for projects in developing countries, thus reducing the financial burden on their economies.\n106.\tFurthermore, we need to use modern technology in order to provide for a comprehensive international food security program. This will help to eradicate hunger and overcome the problems involving low agricultural production and creeping desertification and will help land reclamation and water resource development.\n107.\tWithin this framework any practical formula designed to set up cooperation between developed and developing countries has to take into consideration the importance of establishing a \\\"technology bank\\\" in order to transfer to the developing countries all aspects of technology from the industrialized world. Such a bank would also facilitate technical cooperation between the developing countries themselves.\n108.\tWe also hope that a well-thought-out program within a structured framework to which all nations can subscribe will arise out of the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held next month at Cancun, within the framework of the NorthSouth dialog.\n109.\tThe third issue I should like to discuss, among the many important subjects submitted for discussion during this session, is the aspiration of many peoples for self- determination and for independence from foreign domination which impedes their legitimate hopes for a better future. In line with our Arab and Islamic heritage and our belief in the absolute right of peoples to liberty and independence, Jordan supports the struggle of the people of South Africa. We call upon the international community to exert further pressure upon those who aid and abet the racist South African regime. The apartheid policy of South Africa must end, as should its aggression against neighboring countries. South Africa must end its occupAtion of Namibia and abide by United Nations resolutions, specifically, Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The international community should put an end to the aggressive South AfricanIsraeli cooperation in the political, economic, military and cultural fields. As a result of nuclear cooperation, these ties pose a direct threat to the peoples of Africa and the Arab world, as well as to international peace and security.\n110.\tIt is in the context of self-determination that Jordan views the situation in Afghanistan, Eritrea and Namibia and calls for the implementation of Security Council resolutions which demand noninterference in the internal affairs of nations and affirm the right of all peoples to self- determination in full freedom. Jordan also calls for a peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem, particularly through the efforts of the United Nations to ensure its unity, independence and nonalignment.\n111.\tI mentioned earlier some of the general issues which face the world of today and which will threaten the future of mankind unless they are addressed adequately and with genuine concern by the international community. Another important and grave, issue, in addition to those J have mentioned, is .the Middle East problem, at the base of which is the tragedy of the Palestinian people and their land.\n112.\tI do not wish to go into the details of that issue, which is 33 years old. His Majesty King Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, in his two speeches to the General Assembly in 1967,3 immediately after Israel treacherously occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Sinai and the Golan Heights, and again in 1979 adequately dealt with the various aspects of this problem, its evolution and its implications. Therefore I will not bore delegations with repetition. In his 1967 speech, His Majesty was the first to underline that real peace can be built only on justice, if it is to lead to the achievement of the desired objective. He concluded his second speech as follows:\n\\\"If I have spoken at length about the problems of our region, it is because they are fateful problems affecting the life and future of my nation and touch in a very direct manner on the peace of the world.\\\"\nThe Palestinian problem has become the concern of the world at large and has commanded the attention and efforts of the United Nations as has no other problem.\n113.\tIsrael occupied the greater part of the land of Palestine in 1948, dispersed its people and suppressed its character and political identity. After its aggression of 5 June 1967, Israel occupied, as it still does, all the land of Palestine as well as a part of other Arab lands. A quick glance at the map of the area shows the difference between what the United Nations accepted in 1947 as the territory of Israel in General Assembly resolution 181 (II) and what that territory is today. It goes without saying that Israel has violated the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the Organization, which accepted Israel as a member on condition that it implement resolutions 181 (II) of 1947 and 194 (III) of 1948. Israel did not consider it enough to drive the Palestinians out of their own land as refugees and displaced persons or to persecute them under its occupation, but has sought deliberately to change the identity of the Arab and Palestinian land which it occupied as a result of the aggression of 1967. Israel is intensifying its settlement efforts and has filled its new settlements with settlers from elsewhere; it has confiscated Arab public and private property as well as water and other natural resources and placed them at the disposal of those new settlers. Israel has challenged international law by its unswerving political decision to Judaize and annex Arab Jerusalem. It continues, through the actions and public statements of its leaders, to pursue total annexation of occupied Palestinian lands on the basis of unjustifiable ancient mythical claims.\n114.\tThe Arab people living under occupation, who resist the Zionist plans for annexation with great heroism, are subjected to severe punishment comparable to the worst used throughout human history. Under Israeli military occupation the Palestinians have suffered mass punishment, the demolition of their houses and the exile or physical liquidation of their leaders. Israel has even forbidden the municipalities and village councils to receive aid and support in order to develop their localities and offer basic services to the population. As a result of this measure, which has halted the activities of public services and administration, the population has been left without the necessary resources by either the occupation authorities or their fellow Arabs. The occupation authorities are linking the economy of the occupied Arab territories to that of Israel, thus forcing the Palestinians to leave their land so that Israel may accommodate new settlers on it and consequently annex the occupied Arab territories to the Zionist entity.\n115.\tIsrael would not be able to continue in its aggressive and expansionist policy or to challenge international law without the total political, economic and military support it receives from certain countries, in particular the United States of America. United States support for Israel has enabled it to continue to occupy Arab lands, challenge the will of the international community, violate the resolutions of the United Nations and cause instability and insecurity in the region.\n116.\tUnited States support for Israel is based on the claim that the United States is committed to ensuring the security of Israel, a claim about which the United States has so far failed to be totally precise. Is the United States committed to the Israel of the 1947 Partition Plan, or the Israel of the armistice of 1948 or the Israel of 1967? The United States support for Israel on such an ambiguous basis and Israel's alteration of the basic features of Arab lands are understood by the Arabs to mean that the United States is committed to an expansionist Israel at Arab expense.\n117.\tThe continuous supply of advanced weaponry to Israel on the false Western assumption that it will provide security for Israel is proving to be largely counterproductive. It is the Israeli arsenal, including nuclear capability, that constitutes a direct threat to stability and peace in the region and in the world at large. The recent agreement between Israel and the United States involving strategic cooperation and complementary arrangements has increased the dangers of polarization. It also adds to the doubts and fears of the Arab nation and increases the existing dangers. This continuing and total support for Israel has encouraged it to expand its sphere of aggression in the area. To it can be attributed what Israel has achieved in a short span of time.\n118.\tFirst, the Zionist entity has annexed Arab Jerusalem despite international objections and condemnation and despite the reverence in which all peoples and religions, whether Christian, Moslem or Jewish, hold the Holy City.\n119.\tSecondly, it has initiated the MediterraneanDead Sea canal project. This signifies continued Israeli expansion without any consideration for the sovereignty, of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan or the harm it will cause the latter's economic and social programs. It also prejudices Palestinian rights in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This project, which Israel intends to execute, is a direct threat to the security and peace of the area, the more so since it not only invites new settlers but envisages the construction of nuclear plants along the new canal, thus augmenting Israel's existing nuclear capacity. The resolution adopted by the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy held at Nairobi last August firmly condemns Israel's action and opposes its aggressive plans. It is our hope that that first step will be followed by further action by the General Assembly in order to consolidate efforts in opposition to that aggressive project.\n120.\tThirdly, Israel continues to interfere in Lebanon, thus intensifying the suffering of our sister country. The continuous Israeli efforts are aimed at dismembering Lebanon and at occupying the south of the country, with its water resources. We all vividly remember the victims of the savage Israeli air strikes against residential areas and Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut and southern Lebanon last July.\n121.\tFourthly, Israel committed an unprecedented violation of international law by attacking Iraq's nuclear installation last June, after Iraq had announced the peaceful purpose and use of its nuclear installation, which was regularly open for inspection by IAEA. The peaceful purpose of the installation was reemphasized by the Director General of IAEA in his report to the Security Council last June.6 Furthermore, while Iraq is a signatory to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Israel refuses either to sign that Treaty or to allow inspection of its own nuclear facilities.\n122.\tIn contrast to Israel's belligerence in attempting to control the Middle East, there is a sincere Jordanian and Arab desire for peace built on justice that will lead to stability for the Middle East region as a whole.\n123.\tJordan, which has experienced the full dimensions of the tragedy of the Palestinians and their land and has suffered its consequences owing to unjust international practices, firmly supports, together with all other Arab countries, the international initiatives on the Palestinian and Middle East problems. Our cooperation with Mr. Gunnar Jarring was total and genuine, as was our participation in the Geneva Conference of 1973. Jordan also welcomed the joint Soviet-United States communique of 1 October 1977 and the Venice Declaration of June 1980 as positive steps in the right direction. In the same spirit we welcomed the Soviet call for an international conference to discuss these problems, with the participation on a basis of equality of all the parties concerned, including thePLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n124.\tJordan's position springs from the consensus on national principles adopted by the Arab summit conferences in Baghdad, llinis and Amman, which emphasized the Arabs' demand for justice and peace in the framework of their commitment to the attainment of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East and for the implementation of the basic principles of the United Nations and the Security Council as enunciated in resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the Arab lands occupied in 1967, including Arab Jerusalem, and a guarantee of respect for the national rights of the Arab Palestinian people. Those rights include the right to self-determination and an independent State on Palestinian national soil and a guarantee of the security and Stability of all the States of the region.\n125.\tIt is with this clear and positive outlook that we are ready to cooperate in any sincere initiative aimed at finding a just and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian and Middle East problem. We have rejected any attempts at achieving a unilateral peace through partial solutions that benefit only one side. Accordingly, we have clearly and consistently rejected the Camp David agreements, which ignore the core of the problem and the most elementary inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and which take no account of the minimum basic requirements for a comprehensive and just solution. Furthermore, those agreements have strengthened Israel's intransigence and encouraged it to defy the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council, which should be binding upon all States.\n126.\tAnother issue related to the security and stability of the region in which we live is the continuing war between Iran and Iraq. This armed conflict has caused great sadness in Jordan, as it involves a confrontation between two brother Islamic States. Jordan's position is based on the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and its resolutions and on international law. Furthermore, it emanates from a national Arab commitment whereby Jordan stands by Iraq in its defense of its legitimate national rights over its lands and waterways and stands by Arab interests in the Gulf region. However, Jordan still hopes that the Islamic Republic of Iran will respond positively to Iraq's offer of peace, as well as to the efforts of other Islamic and international mediators and, in particular, that it will accept the role of the special envoy of the SecretaryGeneral and the nonaligned nations. These efforts, we hope, will resolve the conflict and bring peace while safeguarding the rights of each party. The principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries must be respected within a policy of good-neighborly relations based on international law.\n127.\tWe appreciate fully the positive resolutions adopted by the various international organizations, such as the group of Islamic States, the nonaligned movement and the OAU, as well as by peace-loving Member States either through their regional conferences or in the General Assembly. We consider the stands taken by these organizations and States as a principal source of the legitimacy of our rights, and the justice they invoke is a clear condemnation of Israel's policies, mentioned earlier, which,, place hurdles in the wayof peace.\n128.\tThere is no doubt that the peace and security of the world depend largely on achieving peace and security in the Middle East. Should its present instability be allowed to continue, it will threaten the entire human race with destruction, in view of superPower polarization in seeking to control our vital region.\n129.\tIf the human race is to maintain its claim of being civilized, then it is imperative that humanitarian principles be the cornerstone of this claim. An internationally recognized framework of comprehensive humanitarian principles should govern relations among peoples and nations in times of war and of peace. It should have a built in monitoring system and should become the basis for the solution of problems of refugees and displaced persons, poverty, illiteracy, terrorism and other issues that are detrimental to the progress of mankind.\n130.\tI should like to propose to the Assembly the promotion of a new international humanitarian order parallel to the efforts being made in the economic and other fields. Before dealing with economic and political problems, let man learn to be more human. I believe that just as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights has become the springboard for a number of international covenants and legal principles, this comprehensive international humanitarian order may offer a new impetus for a code of conduct in human and international relations of which we are so desperately in need. In this connection I quote from the Holy Koran:\n\\\"Oh thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards\nthy Lord painfully toiling but thou shalt meet\nHim.\\\"\n131.\tJordan is willing to cooperate with you, Mr. President, and with the General Assembly in crystallizing this idea and translating it into reality.\n132\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of Barbados wishes to add its congratulations to those which have already been expressed on your election, Mr. President, to preside over the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n67.\tThe decade of the 1980s is probably the most dangerous, certainly the most critical, since the Second World War. The world economy is in crisis. Inflation in all countries, rich and poor, has got out of control. The recession in the developed market economies has generated a concomitant downturn in the economy of the developing countries. There was a sharp slowdown of world economic growth in 1980. The year 1981 has so far not provided much hope for economic comfort, and politically the prevailing atmosphere and forecasts for the future are equally dismal. The level of violence across the globe is awakening the consciousness of world leaders to the need to look for solutions to the social, economic and political problems confronting us. Under your guidance, Mr. President, we hope to resolve some of the problems which paralyse the world community and to arrest some of the numerous disturbing trends in the international situation.\t\\\"\n68.\tMy delegation wishes to place on record its appreciation of the efforts of the outgoing President, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar. He dedicated himself effectively to the variety of issues that confronted the Organization and that also threatened the maintenance of international peace and security.\n69.\tAs we bid farewell to a President from the North and say welcome to you, Sir, a President from the South, my delegation continues to observe the overwhelming economic and social disparities between North and South. We note that repeated attempts to thrash out the manifold problems of NorthSouth cooperation have so far produced little. It is indicative of the cynicism and lack of political will of the developed countries that the Brandt report a useful blueprint for economic cooperation between the developed and developing countries, is gathering dust in the chancelleries of the North.\n70.\tUnless there is significant progress in NorthSouth cooperation in the immediate future, the lives of the peoples of the South will continue to be ravaged by poverty, starvation and disease. My delegation, therefore, regrets that the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom are cutting back further on aid to the developing world.\n71.\tIt may be timely to warn that continuing mass unemployment, mass poverty and mass starvation will destroy the world community as we know it today. The third world will not collapse and die in splendid isolation. Either we eat together, work together and prosper together or we die together. It is time for those developed countries to reorder their priorities and spend more on foreign aid to alleviate the suffering of peoples in the developing countries.\n72.\tBarbados has given unstinting support to General Assembly resolution 34/138, calling for comprehensive negotiations on international relations in the fields of raw materials, development, energy, trade and the monetary system. Barbados itself has, as far as its resources would permit, laid great stress on policies such as the proper management of the economy, improved trade relationships, the development of new sources of energy and the more equitable distribution of its resources. We are firmly convinced that economic development has a better chance of being achieved if there is a commitment to social justice, for then the entire population of each one of our countries will believe that they have a stake in their country's prosperity.\n73.\tTo illustrate the general slowdown in the rate of economic growth, it may be noted that world output has fallen steadily from the modest growth rate of 4.7 per cent in 197678 to 3.8 per cent in 1979 and to a mere trickle of 2.2 per cent in 1980.\n74.\tThe economic indicators point to an even gloomier outlook for 198182. The World Development Report 1981, recently published by the World Bank, warns that if the world economy does not reduce poverty and expand international trade, 220 million more people will become absolutely poor by the year 2000. Unfortunately, there is every indication that rather than am expansion of international trade there is an ever increasing tendency towards protectionism. And we shall suffer as a result. The interdependence of the economies of our nations is too well known to need repetition here.\t; ,\n75.\tAs we have repeatedly affirmed, in concert .with other developing countries* any attempts to contravene the principle of universality as far as the third programming cycle, 198286, is concerned are doomed to failure as far as correcting the causes of the world's economic malaise is concerned, In this regard, we view with grave misgivings any attempt to differentiate unilaterally, and arbitrarily among and classify developing countries,\n76.\tBut this is exactly what the World Development Report 1981 does. Continued use of per <capita !gross< national product and population size as basic criteria for allocation of resources works seriously against^ small developing countries like Barbados. The Report states that, unfortunately, aid flows to the third world are unlikely to grow, that they are already too heavily biased towards the middle-income countries and that reallocating concessional aid from the middle-income to low-income countries is almost as important as increasing its overall amount.\n77.\tThis ominous admission suggests that it will become increasingly difficult for developing countries to receive the assistance necessary for their economies to take off. But there is a solution. The Brandt report referred to it when it stated:\t'\n\\\"One half of one per cent of one year's world military expenditure would pay for all the farm equipment\nneeded to increase food production and approach self\nsufficiency in food deficit low-income countries by\n1990\n78.\tFor all these countries there is no substitute for increased development assistance. In 1979 the combined current account deficits of the non-oil-producing countries amounted to $43 billion, while their accumulated debt burden totaled $330 billion. At the same time, net official development assistance to them from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] fell from a level of 0.4 per cent of the latest gross national products in the late 1960s to 0.3 per cent in 1978. Those developed countries which have attained' the agreed objective of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product are to be commended for their efforts.\n79.\tThe Report states that for the developing countries the 1980s will be a difficult decade of adjustment to external conditions and recommends that third-world countries should adopt an outward orientation that includes export promotion and import substitution in line with international prices.\n80.\tIs it not a fact that after the Second World War some developing countries attempted to develop industry to achieve import substitution but failed because of inherent infrastructural weaknesses? Their base was weak because the local market was small. They were faced with such drawbacks as limited technological infrastructure. Products were of inferior quality, and their prices were far higher than those of similar products in the international markets.\n81.\tNot only did this import substitution policy have disappointing results, but it coincided with a period of neglect of agricultural development which has had dire consequences, for the world's peoples, especially those of the developing world. It is acknowledged that the policy did not achieve its objective of improving the balance of payments. The external debt of Latin American countries 40 years ago was $6 billion. It is now $70 billion.\n82.\tThe lesson that the world has become an interdependent unit and that it is impossible for countries really to develop and achieve autarky in isolation has obviously not sunk in, in spite of all the evidence so far. During the Second United Nations Development Decade a number of possible solutions to the deep seated structural imbalances in the international economy were identified. Although some of the quantitative targets have been achieved, the social aims in particular have not been realized.\n83.\tBarbados was among those countries which welcomed the opportunity to start afresh with the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, which was adopted at the thirty fifth session of the General Assembly. It set a clear {framework of realistic objectives and targets. The obligations and commitments placed on both developed and developing countries should form a major plank in our efforts towards a transformation of the world economic order.\n84.\tWe also believe that collective self-reliance and economic cooperation at all levels among developing countries should be encouraged. Particular emphasis should be placed on regional cooperation. In this respect, Barbados will continue to exert every possible effort to achieve effective economic integration with its neighbors in the Caribbean area and to develop further economic and other links among the peoples of the wider region.\n85.\tMy delegation represents a tiny but proud and industrious Caribbean nationState. We are peace-loving, forward-looking and rigorously democratic. We support the principle of the equality of States and the principle of the universality of the United Nations. My Prime Minister said from this podium at the thirty-first session that \\\"we island people from the Caribbean stand at the crossroads where history meets and where alien civilizations converge.\\\" [26th meeting, para. 5.]\n86.\tAt this time, as we look across the Caribbean Sea and to our brothers and sisters to the south of us, we are painfully aware that history, politics, economics and alien civilizations have merged seemingly to negate the peaceful development of the islands of the archipelago and our continental neighbors.\n87.\tIt is with grave concern that we view the open competition in this region between the two major superPowers. It is unfortunate and frightening that Moscow and Washington should choose the internal conflicts of Latin America and the Caribbean to extend their theater of war. We reiterate our firm commitment to ensuring that the Caribbean will remain a zone of peace. Barbados believes that the problems of Latin America and the Caribbean must be solved by the people of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n88.\tLatin America and the Caribbean suddenly erupted on to the world agenda as a major trouble spot. As we view conflict in Nicaragua and El Salvador devastating the peoples and economies of those sad countries, my delegation once again appeals to the superPowers to respect the tenets of the Charter, which they were instrumental in framing.\n89.\tOnly ethnocentrism and neo-colonial ambitions could inform the superPowers that the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean cannot settle their problems themselves. Implicit in the fact of political independence and national sovereignty in the Caribbean and Latin America is the rejection of imposed solutions.\n90.\tMy delegation does not claim to have any unique insight into how the numerous and seemingly intractable problems of the world can be solved. Indeed, we have no particular optimism that they can be easily solved. We are aware, however, of the primary motivating factors born of realpolitik priorities in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n91.\tIn recent times plans have been designed to revitalize the economies of the Caribbean and Central American States and provide what is categorized as \\\"sustained economic development\\\". While my delegation welcomes capital and other development assistance in the region, I would caution that the essential objective of such activity should be the genuine and unfettered economic development of the area, rather than the promotion of the security interests of exogenous Powers.\n92.\tThe development of any plan for the Caribbean and Central America should involve at all stages the people of the region and the indigenous regional financial institutions. This would help us to avoid the adverse sociocultural appendages and the political and social consequences that could result from imposed solutions to the area's problems.\n93.\tThe decade of the 1980s is a period of challenge, contradiction and rampant cynicism. On the one hand, the march of science and technology has pushed back the frontier of ignorance that inhibited our understanding of our environment and of ourselves. The potential for the improvement of the quality of the human condition is vain. On the other hand, mankind seems unwilling fully to come to terms with and effectively to harness the vast potential of science and technology which could significantly improve the human condition.\n94.\tIt is a cruel cynicism that the human race seems to have identified as its imperative mission and ultimate destiny the annihilation of itself. An endless torrent of meetings, speeches and mechanisms has failed to promote real progress in halting the arms race or lowering the tensions among nations. The goal of general and complete disarmament remains elusive. Mankind continues to live in the lengthening shadow of burgeoning nuclear arsenals.\n95.\tThe economic and social problems which form the basis of the NorthSouth dialog cannot be viewed in isolation from the arms race and the ever increasing military expenditure. Nations cannot fulfill the just aspirations of their peoples in an atmosphere of tension. Peace and security cannot coexist with immense stockpiles of armaments.\n96.\tThe world has embarked on a dangerous new round in the arms race. As more nations think it necessary to acquire more sophisticated weapons, the arms race becomes more competitive, more complex and more dangerously compelling. It is a sad paradox of twentieth century life that third-world economies, buffeted by recession in the developed market economies, are spending better than 12 per cent of their gross national product on the procurement of weapons of war. It is a dramatic commentary on the alleged intelligence of mankind and his choice of priorities.\n97.\tThe continuing absence of the required political will to adopt national policies and implement appropriate strategies to engender confidence among States has resulted in the persistent squandering of scarce resources on military budgets. Today's announcement on the new round of talks on the reduction of nuclear arms gives the world a small ray of hope. The extent of the misuse of the world's resources and the contradiction between urgent human needs and tardy and reluctant responses call for no recapitulation here. It is necessary only to remind ourselves that more is spent on the means of self-extinction than is available to the poor of this world to spend on the means of survival.\n98.\tIt is a fact of life that in 1980 the two superPowers accounted for 58 per cent of world military expenditure. In collaboration with their respective allies they accounted for 80 per cent of all military budgets. Military expenditure tends to contribute to the aggravation of inflation and to adverse balance of payments problems. It should be remembered that more money spent on the military increases inflation and consequently generates a reduction in foreign aid to the developing world. We ignore at our peril the nexus between the menace of the arms race and the encroaching economic, social and security crisis.\n99.\tThe five nuclear Powers, which bear special responsibility for safeguarding peace and international security, and in particular the two superPowers, should assist the United Nations to make general and complete disarmament a triumph of experience over seemingly spurious hope.\n100.\tIt saddens me to have to say that the studied avoidance of the serious and pressing problems facing the continent of Africa is nothing short of scandalous. Too many words have been spoken on the problems of apartheid and Namibia, and far too little realistic action has been taken or even attempted. Apartheid and Namibia are matters that have been the subject of debate in one form or another since the first regular session of the Assembly. They have also been subjects of consultations and discussions in the Security Council and at special conferences and meetings.\n101.\tThe General Assembly and Security Council have passed resolutions, and special conferences have formulated declarations. There is not a single delegation here that is prepared to stand up in public and defend South Africa for its adherence to the inhumane system of apartheid, or for its occupation of Namibia. Indeed, 15 years ago the United Nations declared that occupation illegal {General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI)].\n102.\tYet now some Member States are urging, in the second year of the decade, a gradual solution of the\nNamibia problem, Some of these same nations are reluctant to interrupt their lucrative economic ties with South Africa and balk at imposing sanction? for fear,, they would have us believe, of hurting the African, States that have the misfortune to border on or .to. be encompassed' by South Africa. In other words, the same countries are so concerned about the welfare of the front-line States that they continue to prop up the economy of South Africa. They are so mindful of the need for democracy in Angola that they will ignore their own resolutions while continuing, to support the illegal occupation of Namibia\n103.\tThe Government and people of Barbados were distressed when we realized that the Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand was to proceed as planned. Our\nwas, however, somewhat relieved by the large number of countries that not only spoke abut against the tour, out took action which was aimed at stopping it, or at least making it more difficult for it to proceed. We were particularly gratified by some of the positions adopted and the , actions taken by some of the older members of the Commonwealth and by a large number of New Zealanders themselves.\n104.\tI will not attempt to dictate to those who have for centuries been dictating to others and have been determining the course of history is less powerful countries over the globe. I will not attempt to tell them how to end the misery of millions of black people who are held hostage and captive in the lands of their birth in Namibia and Azania. They know what should and must be done as well as anyone else and better than many.\n105.\tThe illegal and racist regime in Pretoria should not be allowed to defy further the collective decisions of the international community. I call upon this body today to end the charade, to close ranks and to move with dispatch to bring the South African Government to its senses, or to its knees, before we meet here again for the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n106.\tAnother important matter about which my Government feels very strongly is the question of mercenaries. The General Assembly has already touched on this matter at two sessions without making any notable progress,\n107.\tFrom the point of view of a small developing country, for which self-defense is difficult at the best of times, the need for ensuring combined and concerted action against mercenaries is of vital importance. I heed do no more than to cite the designs on the Commonwealth of Dominica by a group of racist adventurers, including some members of the Ku Klux Klan.\n108.\tBarbados will continue to do all in its power to work towards the early preparation of a convention against the recruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries and urges all concerned countries not only to join in this attempt, but to apply the spirit of the future convention even before its letter has taken shape.\n109.\tWe are extremely concerned by the recent turn of events in the Middle East, which would seem to put any hope of a reasonable solution further out of reach. It is our hope that the actors in the area, as well as the reactors from other areas, will find the magnanimity to look beyond purely narrow self-interest and work towards guaranteeing peace and security in the region.\n110.\tAt its thirty-fifth session, the Assembly adopted resolution 35/20, in which it declared that Belize should become art independent State before the conclusion of the thirty-sixth session and in which it called upon the administering Power to do whatever was necessary to ensure the effective and continued existence of an independent Belize.\n111.\tWe note with satisfaction that, after a series of negotiations between Belize, the United Kingdom and Guatemala, the terms of the resolution are being implemented and that three days ago Belize became independent and will tomorrow, we hope, become a Member of the Organization. Barbados rejoices with the people of Belize. However, there is a tinge of sadness in all this, because Belize's neighbor has not acknowledged its independence.\n112.\tWe call on all countries in the area to give general support to Belize, whose territorial integrity and sovereignty must be upheld. We hope that there will be no necessity to take any action other than the steps which have already been given full publicity.\n113.\tLast week we had the pleasure of welcoming Vanuatu to the family. Later in this session, we may have the pleasure of welcoming another State, the Caribbean island of Antigua.\n114.\tThese developments underline the continuing success of the United Nations in achieving solutions to seemingly intractable problems. The Government of Barbados believes the Organization has the capacity to influence world opinion for the good of all mankind. Let us together keep that faith alive.\n"

        "file_text": "58.\t  Sir, we take pride in your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, particularly since you belong to our Arab homeland and Arab nation, a nation that has contributed to the development of human civilization and is still fighting fascism and Zionism because of its awareness of the dangers those political movements pose to humanity and progress.\n59.\tI take this opportunity also to commend the efforts of your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, during whose presidency the General Assembly engaged in such intensive activities and carried out such difficult work.\nr\n60.\tI also have the pleasure of commending the efforts being made by the SecretaryGeneral to strengthen the role of the Organization in promoting peace and security in our turbulent world. My delegation wishes also to extend congratulations to Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu on their accession to independence and to welcome them to the United Nations.\n61.\tMy country is aware of the threats to international peace and security, and the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya shares with the countries of the third world and the nonaligned movement their concern over the deterioration of the situation in the world. At the same time, however, my country realizes that the causes of that deterioration lie in the policies pursued by the big Powers.\n62.\tThe United States under President Reagan's Administration plays the major role in destabilizing peace and security in the world and has reverted to the cold war and the scramble for spheres of influence. Clear evidence of this is the letter sent recently by the American President to the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, in which he underlined the legitimate interests of the superPowers and his readiness for mutual respect of those interests.\n63.\tThis course of American policy clearly illustrates the nature of the American Administration, which is seeking to partition the world into spheres of influence. The refusal of the United States to ratify the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and its production of the neutron bomb, which has for its target the human race, are only two of the many' pieces of evidence of the United States premeditated aggressive intentions, which are fully in keeping with its ambitious designs for hegemony over the resources of peoples and which constitute a flagrant threat to international peace and security.\n64.\tThe goal of the United States today is to militarize the world and to divide it into two factions, drawing one of them into its imperialist reactionary camp and compelling the other, which includes basically the neutral countries, to join either its camp or the communist camp. In its campaign to force the nonaligned countries to relinquish their nonalignment, the United States pursues various policies, the most prominent of which is that of economic blockade, as is the case with Nicaragua and Cuba, or that of direct aggression. Probably everyone has followed the news of its aggression in the Gulf of Sidra in Libyan territory, where American planes operating from an aircraft carrier violated Libyan airspace and committed the well-known act of aggression of 19 August 1981.\n65.\tAmerican statements have revealed that the aggression was premeditated and had been approved at a meeting of the United States National Security Council. This reveals also that theAmerican forces sent to the Gulf of Sidra were not on routine maneuvers, as American officials have claimed, for routine maneuvers have never been given this aura in the United States.\n66.\tThe Reagan Administration's allegation concerning the extension by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya of its territorial waters to 200 miles is a blatant lie, because we are committed to the internationally recognized 12-mile limit. As for the Gulf of Sidra, it is an integral part of Libyan territory. My country will support any international agreement that can be reached at the third United Nations Conference on the Law of Hie Sea. That Conference has not come to a conclusion yet because of the position taken by the United States itself. Whatever the differences on the demarcation of territorial waters, we call upon the international Organization and peace-loving peoples to stand up against the American acts of aggression and not allow the United States to bestow upon itself the role of a policeman who imposes his will upon others.\n67.\tThe United States aims at pressuring the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya into abandoning its nonalignment and joining the other camp. The delegation of my country calls upon the international community, in particular the nonaligned movement, to confront those pressures with all means available so that my country may not be compelled to ally itself with the friend that aids it in resisting this premeditated American aggression.\n68.\tAmerican aggression against the nonaligned countries has reached a point that reveals the terrorist nature of the American Administration, and there are other recent examples of this. The physical liquidation of the African leader Patrice Lumumba by American intelligence services is evidence of the hatred harbored by the United States towards everyone who is nationalist and progressive in Africa. The United States plot against the progressive Government of Chile and the assassination of its leader, Salvador Allende, confirm the hypocrisy of the American Administration in its claim to democracy. Allende had come to power through democratic elections, in which he was supported by the people of Chile and all sincere people in Latin America and in the world.\n69.\tThe latest act of terrorism on the part of the new American Administration, which has been revealed by the American press and confirmed by some officials, is the existence of a plot to assassinate the leader of the First of September Revolution, Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi.\n70.\tThat plot confirms that physical liquidation and terrorism have become one of the pillars of United States policy in resolving its disputes with everyone who does not follow in its footsteps or obey its will.\n71.\tMy country resists and condemns the terrorist policy of the United States, and we therefore condemn the bacteriological war it is waging against the friendly people of the Republic of Cuba. We also condemn the terrorism practiced by the United States against Nicaragua and Grenada through using grain supplies, loans and economic pressure as weapons to subjugate the struggling peoples of those countries. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya also condemns the support by the United States for the Fascist regimes in Latin America against the will of their peoples \u201e as is the case with El Salvador. We declare our solidarity with the people of El Salvador in their struggle against imperialism and fascism.\n\n72.\tFor all those reasons we believe the United States is no longer fit to serve as host to the United Nations. The least we can ask of the international community is that it should transfer the Organization's Headquarters to a country that respects the Organization and pursues its goals.\n73.\tThe struggle of the Namibian people and their right to independence bring the United Nations face to face with its responsibilities. On the one hand, we find that the international community has acknowledged the right of that friendly African people to freedom and independence, and on the other hand we witness the racist regime, backed by the United States and some Western nations, impeding the will and the resolutions of the international Organization under the pretext of ensuring the rights of the racist minority.\n74.\tThat adamant position on the part of the racist regime in South Africa and of the United States makes Us wonder what steps could be taken by the nonaligned movement and its friends to ensure that the people of Namibia, under the leadership of SWAPO, gain their freedom and independence.\n75.\tThe independence of the people of Namibia can be achieved only through adherence to the following principles.\n76.\tFirst, there is the support for the armed struggle of the people of Namibia, bearing in mind the fact that the liberty of a people is not granted but has to be won, especially within the framework of the Organization where the right to use the veto plays a major part in protecting the interests of imperialist, Fascist and racist countries.\n77.\tSecond is the reaffirmation of the inalienable rights of the people of Namibia to self-determination, freedom and national independence in a unified Namibia, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).\n78.\tThe third principle is emphasis on the fact that SWAPO, as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Namibia struggling for the independence of that Territory, is a main party to the dispute.\n79.\tFourthly, there must be decisive and speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. The implementation of that plan should ensure the full independence of Namibia and the sovereignty of its people under the leadership of SWAPO over all their lands, including Walvis Bay and all the islands off the Namibian coast.\n80.\tFifth is the imposition on the racist regime of South Africa of the sanctions provided for in the resolution adopted at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly [see resolution ES8/2], in order to compel that racist regime to pull its administration out of Namibia and thus speed up Namibia's independence.\n81.\tThe practices of the racist regime of South Africa are sustained by the backing which it receives from the American Administration and some Western countries. That continuous support has enabled the racist minority to monopolize the power, wealth and weapons in the country and to control the destiny of the indigenous population of South Africa. That situation constitutes a flagrant disregard for human rights and a challenge to the conscience of humanity. The international community should therefore assume responsibility for putting an end to these crimes.\n82.\tMy country will continue to support the struggle of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa for freedom and self-determination. The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya also stands by Angola and the other front-line States in their resistance to the barbaric aggression perpetrated against them by the racist regime of Pretoria.\n83.\tThe situation and racist practices in southern Africa are the same as those achieved by the Zionist entity in the Arab land. The international community is now aware of that similarity and of the close ties which exist between the Zionist entity and the South African regime.\n84.\tThe Palestinian cause has become one of the permanent problems that the United Nations has to deal with, as it represents a new form of colonialism. The occupation of Arab Palestine by the Zionist entity constitutes a new form of racist and expansionist colonialism, which has expelled the people of Palestine from their homeland and extended that entity's occupation to the territories of some Arab countries adjacent to Palestine. Thus, under the pretext of safeguarding so-called Israeli security, the new colonialism is posing a threat to the security and peace of the entire Arab world.\n85.\tThe General Assembly has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to the rights of the Palestinian people and has recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians. Moreover, the majority of the members of the Security Council have acknowledged the rights of the Palestinian people and condemned the continual acts of aggression perpetrated by the racist Zionist entity against the Palestinians. However, in spite of that international endorsement of the Palestinian cause, we still find countries which support aggression and oppose the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and refuse to look upon the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n86.\tThus, on the one hand we see the United States providing the Zionist entity with weapons of mass destruction, enabling that entity to strike at the Palestinians everywhere, not sparing them even in their refugee camps, which are themselves a hateful result of the Zionist occupation declared illegal by the international community. On the other hand, we see the United States using its right of veto whenever there is a draft resolution before the Security Council in favor of the Palestinian cause or condemning the repeated acts of aggression perpetrated by the racist regime against Arab lands.\n87.\tFurthermore, the extent of United States disregard for the international community is most clearly shown by its complicity with the Egyptian regime and the Zionist entity in order to impose solutions of the Middle East problem through the Camp David agreements.\n88.\tThe Camp David agreements have ignored the efforts exerted by the United Nations and have pushed the Middle East problem out of the framework of the United Nations. Besides, the parties to those agreements have deliberately sought to eliminate the role of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Moreover, those agreements have freed the Zionists to strike at the Arab nations. That is best evidenced in its repeated acts of aggression against Lebanese cities and villages and the Palestinian camps, as well as it? destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor, under the watchful eyes of the AWACS planes stationed in a part of the Arab world.\n89.\tThe latest example of the American Administration's flouting of the international community is the strategic alliance which it has formed with the Zionist entity. Such an alliance can only be interpreted as an advanced stage in a longterm plan of aggression and terrorism carried out by a superPower which, as a permanent member of the Security Council, is supposed, by virtue of its position, to assume the major responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, instead of conniving with a terrorist racist entity which aspires to carry out the theory propounding Zionist occupation of the entire area.\n90.\tThe American Administration's submission to Zionist pressures happens even at the highest-level policymaking bodies, at the expense of the vital interests of the American people. This submissiveness has the inevitable result of placing not only the Arab homeland but all the countries in the region in a state of direct confrontation with the United States, which persists in defying the will of these peoples.\n91.\tThis pernicious alliance destroys completely the chances of success of any international initiative to reestablish peace in the region. Therefore, it is incumbent on the international community to discharge its responsibilities by denouncing and opposing this alliance and to put an end to imperialist Zionist adventurism.\n92.\tThose who believe in the role of the Organization cannot help asking themselves: Of what use are its resolutions? Why should the United States and the Zionist entity ignore them? In order to remedy this regrettable situation, the United Nations must not content itself with issuing resolutions condemning the Zionist entity, for such condemnation is no longer adequate. The United\nNations has to move forward and impose those sanctions provided for in the Charter, including the expulsion of the Zionist entity, since the presence of a Member which regularly violates its principles and its Charter renders the Organization less effective.\n93.\tThe United Nations has an essential responsibility and a principal role in the field of disarmament, and we expect it to shoulder its responsibility in this regard. In spite of the efforts which it has hitherto exerted and which have resulted in a number of treaties banning nuclear tests and nuclear arms proliferation, and in the convening in 1978 of the tenth special session of the Assembly, on disarmament, the final objective, that of general and complete disarmament, still eludes it and will continue to do so as long as international relations are not based on equity but on persecution, oppression and the threat to use force.\n94.\tThe responsibility for maintaining security and peace is shared by all nations, but we believe that the greatest responsibility should fall on the major nuclear Powers and other countries which are engaged in the arms race. Disarmament should be achieved in accordance with the priorities stated in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the Assembly [resolution S10/2].\n95.\tIn this respect, the delegation of my country condemns the decision by the United States to produce the neutron bomb and to deploy nuclear missiles in Europe, which will result in an accelerated escalation of the arms race and jeopardize international security and peace.\n96.\tThe human race is today faced with many areas of tension which threaten international peace and security. In regard to northern Africa, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has been following the issue of Western Sahara since the Sahraoui people started fighting colonialism. My country has already welcomed the initiative of Morocco, which has agreed to the holding of a referendum on the question and has supported the decision adopted at the latest session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Nairobi in August, on organizing this referendum [see A/361534, annex II, resolution AHG/Res. 103 (XVIII)]. We hope that the referendum will take place in favorable circumstances so as to enable the Sahraoui people to express its desire and decide its own destiny.\n97.\tWe see that on the Asian continent the situation in Afghanistan is a source of worry. It has become obvious that the imperialist camp, under the leadership of the United States, is trying to exploit this situation in its struggle against the Soviet Union. This emphasizes the fact that the United States has no intention of accepting a peaceful solution of this issue. We in the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya reiterate our insistence that Afghanistan remain neutral, and we express our opinion that the international repercussions of the Afghan issue should be remedied and that the acts of aggression against Afghanistan should cease, so as to enable the friendly Government of Afghanistan, acting on it own, to reestablish peace and security in the country.\n98.\tAs for theKorean issue, my delegation reaffirms its support for the unity of the Korean people and praises the peaceful efforts carried out thus far, especially if these efforts result in a nonaligned unified Korea uninvolved in any international conflict.\n99.\tBearing in mind militant imperialism and in conformity with the principles of the nonaligned movement, and in an effort to promote cooperation among the countries of that movement, my country signed, in Aden on 19 August 1981, a treaty of cooperation and friendship with both Ethiopia and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. This treaty aims at promoting the economic potential of its signatories and consolidating the political cooperation among them so that they can maintain their neutrality and nonalignment.\n100.\tThe deterioration of the world economy and the symptoms of this deterioration that we witness in inflation, unemployment and economic stagnation can be attributed to the economic order that has prevailed since the Second World War.\n101.\tIt is clear that the major shortcoming of the current economic order is that it was established without the participation of the developing nations whose economy constitutes a major portion of the components of the world economy. Furthermore, the current economic order favors the interests of the developed industrial nations, which has prompted these nations, headed by the United States, to obstruct any serious step toward the establishment of a new international economic order: Though the General Assembly has defined the features of the new international economic order in its sixth and eleventh special sessions, and though more than a year has elapsed since the convening of the eleventh special session, a small group of capitalist countries still wrangles over a starting date for the global negotiations on development and international cooperation, in order to serve their own interest and in accordance with their conditions.\n102.\tEconomic cooperation among developing nations is a primary and necessary component for achieving a new international economic order, as well as one of its main objectives. Economic cooperation among developing nations cannot replace the NorthSouth dialog; it is complementary to it. Economic cooperation among developing nations has achieved tremendous progress during the past few years, particularly since the conferences at Arusha and Mexico and the High-level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held last May at Caracas, which adopted a comprehensive, ambitious program for economic cooperation among developing nations [A/36/333 and Corr.l, annex]. This program will be a significant factor in achieving collective self-reliance and economic development of developing nations. The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, as a developing nation, wholeheartedly supports economic cooperation among developing nations and seeks the achievement of its objectives through the aid it provides to other developing nations, either bilaterally by establishing joint companies and banks, or in the form of the assistance provided by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or through trade and the exchange of experts or information in the scientific and technological fields.\n103.\tPursuant to its concern for social and humanitarian causes and inspired by the lofty ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya proposed during the thirty-first session of the General Assembly that the year 1981 be designated the International Year of Disabled Persons, with the theme \\\"Rill Participation and Equality\\\".\n104.\tAs we celebrate this International Year of Disabled Persons, and as we endeavor to implement its theme, we are delighted to commend the sincere response to all the plans national, regional and international to help accomplish the objectives of the International Year. It is a true indication of the importance bestowal by the international community upon more than 500 million disabled persons. We appeal to the international community to consider this Year as a starting point in meeting the concerns of disabled persons in the long term.\n105.\tThe Advisory Committee for the International Year of Disabled Persons, over which my country is honored to preside, played a positive part in the activities relevant to the objectives of the International Year. Moreover, the longterm world plan of action, which the Advisory Committee will complete next year, will be of special importance in implementing the future policy of the international community in caring for disabled persons and promoting their participation in the economic, social, political and cultural life of their society equally with their fellow citizens.\n106.\tWe take this opportunity also to emphasize the importance of the World Symposium of Experts on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries and Technical Assistance in Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation, which is scheduled to be held at Vienna from 12 to 23 October 1981. We hope that this Symposium will have positive results leading to laying the foundations for technical collaboration in this humanitarian cause, thus contributing towards the realization of the objectives set out for the International Year of Disabled Persons.\n107.\tAmong the activities undertaken by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya at the national level was the convening last May of the National Conference on Disabled Persons living in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to consider the programs that would best assist them. Subsequently, Bill No. 3 for the year 1981 was promulgated, which is considered a progressive law in the field of preventing disability and of rehabilitation. At the international level, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya organized ah international symposium recently, from 27 September to 4 October, the theme of which was \\\"Rill Participation and Integration\\\". A great number of countries and international organizations, governmental and nongovernmental, participated.\n108.\tAlthough it is now more than 35 years since the Second World War ended, its economic and social effects are still felt in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and other countries. In addition to the total and direct destruction inflicted on the cities and villages of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya during the war itself, my country still suffers from the remnants of this destructive war because of the minefields planted by the belligerent forces, which cover vast areas of our territory. Thousands of innocent victims among the Libyan people have been killed or mutilated as a result of the mines, which have sown death and destruction across Libyan territory. Barely a day passes without a mine explosion causing the death or mutilation of an innocent citizen whose contribution to the process of economic and social transformation is so desperately needed. The belligerent countries which were immediately responsible for the minefields know very well what is happening. Those countries, moreover, have not yet carried out their international obligations, foremost of which is to provide the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya with the maps, information and other necessary data which would help in solving this problem.\n109.\tAlthough this problem has been before the international community for some time, and despite the adoption of numerous resolutions, the latest being General Assembly resolution 35/71, which provides for compensating the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for the material and human losses arising from this problem, no noticeable progress has been made, because the countries involved have not honored their obligations.\n110.\tWe demand that these countries and the whole international community take the necessary measures to solve this problem and stop the bloodshed among innocent victims.\n111.\tWith regard to the Charter of the United Nations and strengthening the role of the Organization, the great majority of nations have noticed in the past few years that the decline in the role of the United Nations in general, and the Security Council in particular, is primarily the result of the existence of the privilege entailed in the right of veto. The misuse of this privilege by some of the great Powers hampers the attempts of the United Nations to find peaceful and just solutions to world problems. The United States used this privilege during the voting on the draft resolution before the Security Council condemning South Africa's racist regime for its aggression last month against the People's Republic of Angola. It is clear that the right of veto has been used on issues of concern to the national security of some States that are permanent members of the Security Council without regard for the objective with which they justified their enjoyment of this right the protection of world peace and the maintenance of the balance of power.\n112.\tThe time has come to look thoroughly into the role of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization [General Assembly resolution 3499 (XXX)}. During the seven years since it was established as the Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 3349 (XXIX)], it has failed to accomplish the task entrusted to it. We are now faced with the option of either seeking an alternative to this Committee or reorienting its work in the right direction so that it will have specific objectives, including a reexamination of the rule which requires consensus of the permanent members of the Security Council, taking into consideration the following: the principle of equality among nations, maintenance of international peace and security as a responsibility shared by all Member States, the strengthening of the role of the Security Council in preserving international peace and security and an increase in the number of members of the Security Council to reflect the new forces that have emerged in the international arena.\n113.\tThe right of veto in its present form is one of the spoils of war, as it was exclusively appropriated by the victorious nations in the Second World War. The establishment of the United Nations as an international organization embracing the entire international community should have been geopolitical reason enough to make the right of veto a balancing element among groups and continents. However, the continuing monopoly of the right of veto in the prevailing manner will prompt us to question the effectiveness of the United Nations and its resolutions.\n114.\tIn conclusion, on behalf of the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, I wish to express our sincere hope that the Organization will be successful in promoting good relations among peoples and achieving prosperity, as well as international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, as the first speaker in the general debate, it is my privilege to extend the first words of congratulation to you upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session.\n3.\tRelations between Iraq and Brazil, based on the solidarity between our two nations and strengthened by our converging action towards common objectives, fit into the broader context of co-operation between developing countries on an equal basis.\n4.\tYour election is certainly a tribute to your country, but just as certainly a tribute to your personal and professional qualifications. I am confident that under your leadership the work of the present session of the General Assembly will be conducted with the greatest skill and efficiency.\n5.\tI should also like to express our appreciation for the able and confident manner in which Mr. von Wechmar presided over the thirty-fifth session. His performance fully justified the international community's decision to entrust him with this important role in such particularly difficult times.\n6.\tOn the occasion of Vanuatu's admission to membership in the United Nations, I should like to express a cordial welcome to this new Member of our Organization.\n7.\tIn the Latin American tradition of support for decolonization, I congratulate Belize upon its accession to independence. Brazil wishes for that country a future of peace and prosperity.\n8.\tConflicts and tensions of both a political and an economic nature exist in various parts of the world, adversely affecting the Organization and the functioning of the international system. Beyond those tensions and conflicts, which are almost inevitable given the present state of relations among nations, what causes us even greater concern is the perception that the international order's ability to contain and resolve those conflicts is diminishing. The ideal of a community of nations is being gradually replaced by an attitude of conformity and the acceptance of perpetual conflict. The strategy of mutual challenge tends to limit the efficacy of the means for peaceful solutions of international disputes. Purportedly for the purpose of strengthening peace and security, the arms race has resumed, particularly in the nuclear field, to the detriment of essential priorities for the building of the future.\n9.\tFor some years now we have been living in the age of overkill. What was once to have been the final absurd chapter in a spiraling race has now proved to be only the groundwork for building new nuclear arsenals. Nevertheless, no country is more secure now that it was then. Despite the fact that the stockpiled capacity for nuclear destruction has now reached the equivalent of two tons of dynamite for every living human being, the diversification and sophistication of strategic weapons continue. But the risk of war is as great as ever. Hundreds of billions are spent on activities which are, at best, unproductive. International co-operation to improve living conditions and to create a more equitable international society receives a lesser priority, as if the problems of development should, or even could, wait for a better opportunity.\n10.\tThat irrational allocation of resources and the very international order that endorses it neglect the real problems that beset most of mankind. This state of affairs only favors the perpetuation of inequality among nations.\n11.\tWe do not face a purely moral or ethical issue. What is at stake is the future of the international system itself. A new sense of direction is urgently needed in order to reverse this trend. The second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament scheduled for next year therefore takes on a very special significance.\n12.\tEven though the nuclear-weapon States bear the responsibility of reversing the arms race, the search for satisfactory and lasting solutions must take into account the aspirations of the international community as a whole. Full use should therefore be made of the negotiating machinery provided by the United Nations, which plays a vital role with regard to disarmament.\n13.\tThe present world economic crisis has been with us now for a decade. Yet no clear signs of recovery are m sight. This lack of progress is in itself the strongest evidence of the international community's incapacity so far to adapt to changing circumstances and to react in a creative way to new realities.\n14.\tBesides the very complexity of the economics involved, perhaps the worst crisis we face is one of management. What is still lacking is due recognition of a basic fact: that however traumatic its immediate consequences may be, the meaning of the rapid and unique process of change in the world economy is essentially positive.\n15.\tThe new, more dynamic, and increasingly diversified role played by developing countries in all areas of international trade is a healthy event. Its overall effect has been to expand opportunities for growth in the world economy as a whole. The maintenance of relatively high rates of growth by several developing countries in the 1970s was an important factor in sustaining basic rates of expansion in certain highly industrialized countries, which otherwise would have been in even greater difficulties than the ones they currently face.\n16.\tWhat is missing now, particularly on the part of the developed countries, is the recognition of the need properly to manage the process of change so as to maximize the numerous opportunities for creative partnership between developed and developing countries. That process of change, I might add, cannot be halted and should not be hampered, because it is healthy and desirable for us all.\n17.\tThe unprecedented expansion in trade and capital flows over the past decades, together with the increasing trend towards the internationalization of the factors of production, far outstripped the resources and managerial capacity of the structure devised at Bretton Woods to carry out an orderly evolution of international trade.\n18.\tAs regards the third world, there was a widening of the gap between its needs for external support and the resources available for development co-operation. Insufficient progress in the improvement of the rules and mechanisms of multilateral agencies has made even more acute the inadequacy of the institutional framework to meet the new, larger, and often more complex needs of developing economies.\n19.\tThe international agenda has thus been broadened to include new issues. In many cases, linkages have become apparent between problems that formerly seemed amenable to topical, isolated treatment. In a complex and increasingly diversified world economy, it is not enough to proclaim the fact of interdependence. A serious attempt must be made to resolve the problem of underdevelopment, which affects nearly two thirds of mankind.\n20.\tFor too long the third world countries have been told that development in the South must come about as a by-product of prosperity in the North, as if high levels of demand in the industrial world for products from the developing countries would by themselves ensure the solution of problems that are qualitative in nature and are directly related to the unequal patterns of trade with the highly developed countries.\n21.\tAlmost three decades of accelerated growth and hard, though mostly fruitless, work on the North-South issues have demonstrated that prosperity in the central economies does not necessarily lead them to a higher pie- disposition towards progress in redefining obsolete and unfair patterns of trade with the third world. Recent events have shown that difficulties in those countries tend immediately to harden their position vis-\u00e0-vis the developing world, while the remedies resorted to often have a strong negative impact on the situation of the latter.\n22.\tWe think it would be a mistake, besides being a waste of precious time, to hold the North-South issue in abeyance until the major economies succeed in recovering. On the contrary, we hold that what the international community needs in the present circumstances is a concerted effort to draw up, for the first time in history, an integrated, comprehensive set of principles and measures capable of sustaining world trade, finance and technology flows on a sound course, while paying due attention to the needs of the developing countries.\n23.\tThe North-South issue has passed the stage of confrontation which, incidentally, was never inherent in the exercise but it has yet to move on to the stage of true dialog. This will come about only when the developed world shows itself ready to engage in a negotiating process with the third world. Moderation is, after all, required on both sides, and its expression by the North will have to take the form of a constructive position on development issues as a whole.\n24.\tThe basic premise underlying the whole North- South issue is that it affects all nations, rich and poor alike, In this context, differences of perception need not stand in the way of negotiations about what ultimately are common interests, provided that issues are tackled in a broader, longer-range perspective. The North-South exercise is not a win-or-lose game; it is not a matter of redistributing existing wealth, but, rather, an attempt to define a framework of relations that will provide all countries, developed as well developing, with greater opportunities for growth.\n25.\tAn inescapable conclusion should be drawn: the time is over when benefits in the economic sphere would be best assured by continued additions to a country's power. When the world economy becomes highly diversified and problems assume global dimensions, the challenge is no longer how to gain unilateral advantages, but rather how jointly to define viable ways, of managing an increasingly unstable system. It is our hope that the major developed countries, precisely because of their global responsibilities, will not fail to acknowledge the need for multilateral action on global issues.\n26.\tThe international community has at its disposal a vast heritage of concepts and ideas to use as a basis for a serious commitment to settle the North-South issues. It is high time to take a decision to that effect. The meeting of 22 Heads of State or Government of North and South* to be held in Cancun, Mexico, next October, will provide a unique opportunity for t'\\\" major Western Powers to regain the trust of the third world by showing that there will\nbe no relapse into unilateral attitudes and negative judgments on the relevance of North-South problems. It is essential that this exercise be conclusive. We expect it to result in a clear-cut commitment to contribute to the early launching of the global negotiations, to be conducted in the universal forum of the United Nations. We also hope that a basic consensus will be reached on principles and premises to inspire thereafter what will only then become worthy of the term \\\"North-South dialog\\\". I am instructed to assure this Assembly that President Figueiredo has a deep personal commitment to the success of the Cancun meeting, and that he will spare no effort to help bring about the results we all look forward to.\n27.\tThe prospects for concluding this year the long work of codification of the new law of the sea were frustrated by the sudden decision of one country to revise its entire position on the draft convention. This setback, with its serious implications, gives rise to real concern among all those devoted to the success of the multilateral cooperation effort. However, it served to demonstrate that the vast majority of the countries represented at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea firmly adhere to the principles subscribed to in the Declaration incorporated in resolution 2749 (XXV) and show no disposition to reopen the fundamental points in the draft convention.\n\n28.\tThus the Conference succeeded in advancing its mandate and formalizing the draft convention. A sign of the firm determination of the international community to adopt the convention and to open it for signature next year was the selection of the headquarters of the International Sea-Bed Authority and of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea. I take this opportunity to congratulate' once again Jamaica and the Federal Republic of Germany which were chosen, respectively, to host those two international bodies.\n29.\tAt this time, when there is so much international instability, the movements being made by developing countries towards regional affirmation must not be wasted, since they may well be one of the most efficient means of containing international differences. Regional affirmations supply a basis that cannot be dispensed with if we are to safeguard the complexity and variety of the international scene and to relaunch the drive towards peace, justice and development, in all their aspects.\n30.\tThe efforts of Latin American countries to act on the international scene on the basis of their own national profiles fit perfectly into this larger movement effectively to reduce the levels of international tension.\n31.\tThe Latin American inclination for international co-operation stems from no artificially created option. Attitudes that favor the peaceful settlement of disputes are deep-rooted in Latin America. These attitudes define the mechanisms of international co-operation and demand from Slates mutual respect, equilibrium and equity in bilateral relations.\n32.\tJust as deeply implanted in Latin America is the disposition towards multilateral efforts, towards working together to mould the international system, on the basis of the principles of justice and progress. In fact, the Latin American contribution is its understanding that acceptance of change is the minimum prerequisite for the construction of peace. The processes of change must be democratic, open to participation and based on freedom. The objectives of change must be generous, shaped by ideals of justice and the contours of tolerance.\n33.\tI do not wish to paint an idealized portrait of Latin America. The countries of Latin America have differences of opinion since areas of controversy still remain. There are still disputes over boundaries. The political processes are subject to difficulties. There are structures of dependency that have not been eliminated. Painful problems of development cry out for urgent solution and our countries lack the immediate means to deal with them.\n34.\tNevertheless, through all this diversity there is a clear perception that we must work together. We are proud of the values we have forged from our rich historical experience, in which the defense of the principle of non-intervention is outstanding. Our efforts are inspired by our own ideals and do not attempt to repeat what may have been successful elsewhere. Our major contribution to the international system, a disposition towards negotiation and peace, has never been denied, even in the most difficult and controversial situations.\n35.\tBrazilian diplomacy has always been faithful to these ideals. One of the cornerstones of our foreign policy has been the stimulation of dialog with our neighbors at every opportunity and at every level. President Figueiredo has had meetings with his Latin American colleagues, accepting as his own the responsibility for promoting the ideals of regional co-operation.\n36.\tBrazil views the situation in EI Salvador, as well as in any other part of Latin America, in the same spirit of full respect for the principle of non-intervention. It is the hope of the Brazilian Government that all States will respect the sovereignty of that country and the right of the people of El Salvador to solve their own problems without foreign interference. Brazil believes in the importance of intensifying consultations among the countries of the region so as to avoid the weakening of the fabric of Latin American unity and solidarity by specific issues to the detriment of our common interests.\n37.\tBrazil is proud of its African roots and, faithful to them, is open to co-operation with the developing countries on the opposite shore of the South Atlantic. I should have preferred to confine my remarks to the accomplishments in the process of bringing Brazil closer to Africa. However, one cannot speak of Africa without dealing with two crucial questions which remain unresolved those of apartheid and of the independence of Namibia.\n38.\tBrazil emphatically condemns the institutionalized practice of racism which characterizes the regime of the Republic of South Africa. The universal conscience of mankind, and more specifically the Brazilian national conscience, totally rejects such a way of life, which is incompatible with any idea of justice and equality. Brazil associates itself with the community of nations in the renewal of efforts to ensure South Africa's total compliance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, to which we are all committed.\n39.\tThe question of the independence of Namibia has been dealt with by the international community on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and of the\nplan drawn up by our Organization which the Council has embraced by that resolution and which has been internationally accepted. Brazil fully supports the independence and territorial integrity of Namibia founded on the efforts of the United Nations. The problem, however, has not yet been solved, owing to the intransigence of South Africa, which persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia and deliberately undermines international attempts to achieve a negotiated solution, in sharp contrast to the flexibility and willingness for negotiation shown by the other parties involved. And that is not all. Using illegally occupied Namibia as a base for operations, South Africa carries out systematic acts of aggression against Angola which culminated recently in the invasion and prolonged occupation of areas in the south of that country. These violations of the United Nations Charter, international law and elementary rules of international behavior have been compounded by acts of aggression against other countries that border on South ^Africa.\n40.\tThe attitude of the South African regime constitutes a flagrant disservice to the cause and interests of the West which it absurdly claims to defend. It is a permanent source of tension and polarization in southern Africa, contributing towards turning it into one or more areas for East-West confrontation, to the detriment of the freedom of the peoples of the area. These South African acts of aggression must stop immediately. The illegal occupation of Namibia must cease at once so that it can achieve its independence forthwith and so that all countries of the region, freed at last from the tensions of war, its burdens and commitments, may devote themselves, in Favorable circumstances, to the just cause of their own development and to the authentic expression of their national existence in independence and sovereignty.\n41.\tIn the Middle East a succession of crises bears witness to the deterioration of the general situation. The issues relating to the future of the Palestinian people, that is to say, to the creation of the State of Palestine, and to the conditions that exist in the occupied Arab territories, seem to perpetuate themselves. Furthermore, we have had to witness the aggression against the nuclear reactor of Tamuz and the renewed aggression against the territory of Lebanon.\n42.\tIn the face of such a worsening of the situation, it becomes more and more urgent to implement the resolutions of the United Nations that reflect the international consensus regarding the search for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace. My Government firmly holds to the proposition that the condition? indispensable for peace are the complete withdrawal of occupation forces from all Arab territories; the exercise of the right of the Palestinian people to return to Palestine and recognition of their right to self-determination, independence and sovereignty; the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] in the peace negotiations; the recognition of the right of all States in the region to live in peace within recognized borders.\n43.\tThe absence H)f a comprehensive solution helps to increase tension and provokes localized crises. By the same token, it lessens the possibility of resorting to means for a peaceful solution provided for in the Charter and leads to further violation of its principles. The attack on the nuclear plant in Iraq comes within this context. Despite the attempt made to classify this act as \\\"preemptive\\\", the attack on Tamuz was a flagrant example of the use of force incompatible with the Charter of our Organization.\n44.\tAlthough the position and reactions of my Government in this case have already been expressed, I should like to reaffirm our solidarity with the Government and people of Iraq in the face of the act of aggression they have suffered, in violation of their sovereignty. Moreover, I cannot fail to convey the anxiety we feel about the turmoil and violence in Lebanon, which has so often been the victim of aggression. I reiterate our support for the preservation of the independence, sovereignty and integrity of Lebanon, which has made such a great contribution to the progress of Brazil through the efforts of its emigrant sons.\n45.\tI could not conclude my remarks on the Middle East without expressing my concern about the status of Jerusalem, particularly the steps most recently taken by the Israeli Administration regarding the Holy City.\n46.\tOur position concerning events in Afghanistan is clear, and coincides in essence with that of the broad majority of the developing countries. We are opposed to the violation of the principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples. We are equally in opposition to the manipulation of domestic political conditions in a country in order to create a facade of legitimacy for acts which amount to foreign intervention. Legitimacy cannot be imposed from the outside, and any attempts in that direction only aggravate the situation they purport to resolve. Our support for these 'principles is universal in scope. Any attempt to interfere in internal political processes in Asia, in Africa or in Latin America, as well as in Europe, will forever be the object of unconcealed, open condemnation by the international community.\n47.\t-\tLooking back on the year just past, we see once again that events give us no reason to be optimistic. Serious problems continue to plague international relations, due less to an inability to balance them properly than to an absence of the political will to make use of the mechanisms designed to resolve them. In these circumstances, we should lose neither our confidence nor our analytical spirit, neither our creativity nor our realism. We reaffirm that the international system, to be both just and efficient, must allow for broad, effective and representative participation by the entire community of nations in the decision-making process on world issues. We reiterate our respect for the United Nations Charter, for its purposes and principles, to be equally observed by all. We renew our pledge of confidence in the Organization under the Charter, for which there is no substitute as the legally competent instrument for the achievement of our highest aims.\n48.\tMr. President, I wish every success for the work of this thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly under your able guidance in dealing with the issues on our agenda. The Brazilian delegation will always stand ready to give you its best and most attentive co-operation to help make that success possible.\n"

        "file_text": "2.\t  It is my privilege to convey\nthe warmest congratulations of the Government r d delegation of the Dominican Republic, and my own personal congratulations, to Mr. Ismat T. Kittani on his fitting election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, which election augers well for our discussions.\n3.\tI should like at the same time to express my admiration for Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar's outstanding, correct and vigorous direction of the session just ended.\n4.\tThe delegation of the Dominican Republic, on behalf of its Government and people, extends its condolences to the family of President Anwar El Sadat and to the people and Government of the Republic of Egypt on the tragic death of their head of State, who was one of the pillars upholding peace in the Middle East and in the world today. His death moves us to the most profound thoughts, both in the very heart of the United Nations and in the States that constitute the international community.\n611\nA/36/PV.30\n5.\tIt is a great pleasure to extend a very cordial and friendly welcome to the new Member States that have joined the Organization. We are sure that Vanuatu and Belize will, by their spirit of collaboration and their identification with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, contribute to the achievement of the objectives that fortunately led to its birth in San Francisco in 1945, permitting the world to enter a new era of peace after the devastation of the last world war.\n6.\tAllow me, as Secretary of State for External Relations of the Dominican Republic, to endorse before the General Assembly these words which justify the existence of the United Nations: \\\"Peace is the foundation of international order and the most effective instrument of human progress.\\\"\n7.\tThe situations of conflict we are facing in this period of history illustrate, from every point of view, the sentence I have just quoted. We are living in the nuclear age; we are living through a crisis of law and the proliferation of the most destructive weapons ever conceived. Only with a spirit of good will, cooperation and solidarity will the States Members of the Organization succeed in finding the formulas that are urgently needed for achieving peace.\n8.\tThe task is undoubtedly a difficult and why not say it? ominous one, as the panorama of international politics becomes increasingly complex. Nevertheless, we believe that peace is not impossible when human beings are confronted with a dilemma that has become a challenge to their very survival.\n9.\tThe Dominican Republic, a small country, has struggled vigorously for the rule of freedom and peace in the world, and it is striving increasingly to conduct its international relations in accordance with the standards established in the founding instrument of the world Organization and in the light of the principles of international law.\n10.\tMany years passed before the reality of what the Caribbean represents for this part of the world was taken into account and assessed in the context of the hemisphere. Colonial history reveals that the surrounding ocean was a closed and mysterious place that served as a setting for pirates, buccaneers and freebooters. The history of the island of Tortuga is a murky drama, as described by one of the most respected historians and jurists of the Dominican Republic. This island, located in the path of the hurricanes, is still a reminder of an age of intrigue and death.\n11.\tNo analysis is needed to state that the insularity of the Caribbean area is a fragmented one. It produces characteristic sociological phenomena that have not been advantageous to our harmonious and lasting union. The Dominican Republic enjoys the privilege of being probably the first country to point out that, because of its very nature and geographical situation, insularity should lead to thinking on a regional scale because of mutual interests and the new perspectives now opening up in the world.\n12.\tThus, this idea, which had become rooted in the nation's political thinking, began to take concrete shape during the official visit made to my country by the Minister for External Relations of Costa Rica in 1979. A novel and realistic conception of the greater Caribbean area came into being, based on linking all the independent countries whose territories are washed by those waters.\n13.\tThe work being done to make the Caribbean Basin initiative an immediate reality is most encouraging. This initiative originated with the group sponsored by the United States, and its participants now include the United States, Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. Thus the countries of the region now facing the direct impact of the crisis affecting the international economy could rely on financial resources to meet the challenge of their development.\n14.\tThe Caribbean Basin initiative began to take practical shape after the Nassau meeting of the foreign ministers of those four nations in July of this year. The countries of the area are actively working to make its program of action an immediate reality, for the dismal future looming ahead of us does not permit delay.\n15.\tWe are aware that private investment will play a large role in this program. It must be recognized, however, that several factors will prevent these investments from producing good results in the short term. The hesitancy to commit capital, the lack of energy sources and, in some cases, of the indispensable infrastructure and the high interest rates prevailing in financial markets can constitute discouraging factors for potential private investors. We therefore feel that, in view of the pressing economic situation facing our countries, the program must give priority to official assistance* both financial and through the adoption of measures to eliminate the barriers that affect our countries' exports.\n'6. For the Dominican Republic, whose main export product is sugar, it is a matter for grave concern that various countries that import this staple food are taking measures that have very negative repercussions on selling prices. Reconsideration of those measures, which have such a serious effect not only on the Dominican Republic but on other countries as well, would be an effective and helpful measure of cooperation to be taken by the countries that have adopted them.\n17.\tI would like to say how pleased the Government of the Dominican Republic was to allow the city of Santo Domingo to host the important meetings on the Caribbean Basin initiative. These meetings, which are being held this very week, will assemble representatives from the Caribbean countries, Central America and the group sponsored by the United States.\n18.\tWe should like to make special mention in this world forum of the valuable economic cooperation we are receiving from the countries of the region in the context of the Energy Cooperation Program for Central American and Caribbean Countries, concluded at San Jose on 3 August 1980 by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela, the main suppliers of the oil we consume, under which Mexico and Venezuela are financing part of our oil bill. These funds will be used for development projects.\n19.\tWe have become convinced that human rights and terrorism are separate subjects and that each must be considered individually. We cannot avoid recognizing the fact that under many circumstances there is an obvious connection between them.\n20.\tIn the battle against violation of human rights, the authorities whose task it is to maintain public order have often exceeded the limits established by law. I am referring to a situation in which, in the context of its activity to contain the spreading tide of terrorism, legitimate authority exceeds its jurisdiction and expands its activity to a point where it can be termed a violation of the law. This gives rise to the idea that the concept of State terrorism must be added to that of terrorism pure and simple. Abuse of power, which is also a criminal offense, cannot be allowed to reinforce legitimate prosecution. To exceed those limits constitutes a violation of human rights by the authority acting to prevent this type of violation.\n21.\tIn this context, we should like to mention the proposal made by the Federal Republic of Germany to contribute to a decision aimed at embodying respect for human rights in more concrete form. It is paradoxical that on the one hand physical integrity is considered an inalienable right within the general structure of human rights while on the other hand there is no provision barring the death penalty.\n22.\tIn this period typified by a demand for human rights there is one unacceptable note of discord: namely, the fact that in some countries a punishment reminiscent of the lex talionis is still in effect. The right to punish implies the obligation to regenerate and rehabilitate the individual who committed the offense. Changes in criminological thinking are considerable, and the abandonment of outmoded and barbaric ideas is being advocated. The continued entrusting to the State of the destruction of human beings by human beings, therefore, seems unjustifiable.\n23.\tAt the thirty-fifth session my delegation spoke about this situation [24th meeting, paras. 76 78], which in our opinion is an anomaly. At that time we noted that the American Convention on Human Rights' prohibits capital punishment on the one hand while on the other hand tolerating it in those States where it existed prior to the signing of the Convention. The substantive law of the Dominican Republic prohibits capital punishment, and when we signed the Convention we expressed the hope that in the future this anomaly would be eliminated from that interAmerican instrument governing human rights.\n24.\tSince the first outbreaks of terrorism in the second half of this century the Dominican Republic has supported the principle that terrorism is a violation of common law and accordingly that classifying it as such may be the key to limiting the incidence of international crime. Classification of it as a political crime hinders punishment under the legal system for many acts which then cease to be the subject of the public rejection that justifies the existence of public order. It also elevates the most loathsome transgressions to the status of heroic deeds.\n25.\tIn those cases classification as political crimes encourages protection through asylum and thwarts extradition. In this situation, we recommend that the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism review these arguments thoroughly and include in its study a specific analysis to determine the applicability of triple classification of political crimes according to their nature, their motives and the association of the political crime with a common law crime. This has enjoyed a certain acceptance among those who propound the tripartite idea of the political crime and suggests that classifying terrorism as a crime against the law of nations, with all its consequences, might ultimately prove to be the radical formula that could at last reduce the uncontrolled spread of terrorism.\n26.\tWe believe that the States Members of the United Nations are persuaded that terrorism could lead to a state of anarchy, since it shows every sign of increasing rather than diminishing. The victims of this grave social and political outrage are generally innocent persons while the perpetrators suffer nO risks, as in the case of the taking of hostages, the seizing of aircraft with their passengers and many other forms of terrorism, which must be condemned by joint action.\n27.\tAmong the acts of terrorism which have shocked the world this year and which point to a kind of return to barbarism are the assassination attempts made on President Ronald Reagan and on the Holy Father, Pope John Paul n. They occurred before the echoes or the condemnation by all civilized nations of the taking of postages at the American Embassy at Teheran and at the Dominican Republic's Embassy at Bogota had died down. It could be said that the sacrilegious hand of evil was raised as proof of the unwillingness to search for legal methods and effective formulas to halt the wave of international terrorism.\n28.\tLet us think also of the dramatic death of President Anwar El Sadat. Terrorism is indeed the most odious form of crime.\n29.\tMy delegation wishes to mention at this point the appeal now being made by the Organization for the fostering of good-neighborly relations in the interest of maintaining international peace and security. It is certainly the aim of this proposal to lead to better understanding and harmony among nations, with the consequent reduction of international tensions, and to provide support in preventing disputes and conflicts.\n30.\tWithin the context of this idea of good-neighborliness, the Dominican delegation has submitted a plan [ibid., paras. 5662] based on the relations between the Governments of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share sovereignty over the second largest island in the Antilles archipelago. The results flow not only from that premise but also from one that we consider more specific, that of permanent good will between peoples and Governments. That statement transcends the principle of the interAmerican legal system. To make it doctrinally more attractive and more viable, the idea of a method of action has been embodied in the promising and dynamic phrase \\\"a better will\\\", which implies the idea of continual and progressive transformations toward the goal of brotherhood among States.\n31.\tWith this conviction, we support the proposal on the agenda which gives us the opportunity to make an evaluation that we feel is more ambitious and at the same time more direct and practical: the extension of a, kind of \\\"good will\\\" doctrine to all States alike. It would be a collective appeal, born of the Organization, and its aim in these times of conflict that disturbs the peace of the world would be the defeat or at least the diminishing of the warlike spirit that blocks the peaceful solution of the international conflicts threatening mankind.\n32.\tThe foregoing remarks make this an appropriate time to refer to the countries that share the Korean peninsula.\n33.\tThe Dominican Government has often advocated dialog as the master key that opens the door to good understanding and helps in finding peaceful formulas for settling the conflicts that affect various areas of the earth. Accordingly we favor the resumption of discussions between South Korea and North Korea so that the Koreans themselves may find favorable conditions that can lead to the most suitable independent and peaceful solutions, the reestablishment of mutual trust and the achievement of a lasting peace between the two communities in accordance with the principles of the Charter, in particular the principle concerning the free self-determination of peoples on a footing of equality and mutual respect.'\n34.\tOne supremely important event that serves as yet another example of the dangers lying in wait for the international legal community and thus for the maintenance of peace is the unjustified invasion of Afghanistan, which is contrary to the basic principles of the Charter.\n35.\tWe cannot ignore the fact that it is the responsibility and within the jurisdiction of the Organization to restore the rights trampled underfoot by some States to the detriment of others, when generally speaking the actions are not in response to an act of aggression. Even in such an exceptional case such actions are lawful only when the Security Council has before it an armed conflict, which is not the case with the invading country.\n36.\tIn those circumstances, in order to eliminate the precedent tendentiously created and the consequences of a fait accompli, the least we can hope is that the peace loving countries will support the resolution approved by the Council of the European Community calling for an international conference to find a satisfactory solution that will permit Afghanistan to recover its independence and return to its previous status as a nonaligned country.2\n37.\tWithin those peaceful outlines proposed by the European Council to the Soviet Union to permit the convening of the conference as quickly as possible, it is absolutely necessary that a consensus in favor of such an initiative be reached at this session. Its implementation would diminish the existing tension that is disturbing the peace.\n38.\tWe have devoted particular attention to agenda item 58, on the review of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security for we consider the maintenance of the principle of nonintervention to be vital to the maintenance of peace.\n39.\tWe believe that observers of the international political scene cannot fail to be aware of the violations and the progressive weakening in recent years of the principle of nonintervention, which is the backbone of the maintenance of peace under the aegis of the United Nations. That has been happening despite the General Assembly's reaffirmation last year [resolution 35/158], on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, of the universal and unconditional validity of the basic principles of the Charter, which apply equally to all countries without distinctions of any kind.\n40.\tAt that time, States were urged to comply strictly with their obligations under the Charter, and it was urged that the provisions of the Declaration be applied as a means of making peaceful coexistence possible.\n41.\tWe cannot fail to note the urgent need to practice and support noninterference in the internal affairs of States and to have recourse to peaceful methods for the solution of disputes. That proposal for strengthening peace and security is one for which we should all fight, in circumstances in which it would open wider the doors to international cooperation and render understanding among nations more effective.\n42.\tConflicts undeniably persist in areas of Africa. The situation in Angola and the matter of Namibia are cases in point. Another worrisome problem is that notwithstanding the provisions forbidding the practice of apartheid, it continues to be a cause of friction and could lead to an explosion of violence, which is the principal enemy of peace.\n43.\tWe deplore the fact that in certain areas of conflict the atmosphere is not conducive to the discovery of correct formulas for peaceful solution through discussion. We can rejoice, however, in the fact that Egypt and Israel have been holding meetings concerning the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai Peninsula. That will be a very promising beginning for resolute steps forward in accordance with the Camp David accords. It proves that the climate is becoming more conducive to having peace gradually lead to a new era for the Middle East, an area that for more than 14 years has been overwhelmed by unpredictable negative risks.\n44.\tAt its thirty-fifth session the General Assembly considered a proposal by the Federal Republic of Germany for the creation of an appropriate mechanism for finding ways to control the alarming flood of refugees, which, in the words of the proposing nation, has become a growing threat to good-neighborly relations among States. Consequently, it is a difficult problem, particularly for countries that have a common border.\n45.\tThe Dominican delegation fully shares those concerns and would support the establishment of an ad hoc committee to assume the responsibilities deriving from the program for \\\"International cooperation to avert new flows of refugees\\\".\n\\\n46.\tThe conflict between Iran and Iraq continues without the parties having found suitable formulas to end it by means of a system for peacefully resolving disputes and conflicts. We feel that mediation by the States Members of this Organization is in order, so that the parties involved may arrive at an honorable solution to end the military confrontation that has been devastating the peoples of both nations and which could degenerate into a major disruption in the area.\n47.\tRespecting the principles of nonintervention and self-determination of peoples, the Dominican Government shares the concern of the countries that support peace and human solidarity regarding the present situation in the sister Republic of El Salvador. We express our most fervent hope that the matter will be resolved quickly and in accordance with the sovereign will of the people of El Salvador.\n48.\tA review of the figures, in the light of what has been called the population explosion, causes concern when estimates and evaluations point to the existence on our planet of 9 billion human beings by the year 2100. That trend is occurring despite indications of concern by many countries regarding the prospects of excessive population growth, a problem that urgently calls for particular attention to family planning.\n49.\tAs regards the Dominican Republic, the Organization is aware that the official plans cautiously being put into practice in our country are proving very satisfactory. We could say that in the Dominican Republic we are shaping a national awareness propitious to the practice of family planning and responsible parenthood and antithetical to the practice of abortion.\n50.\tThe Dominican Republic is honored to have been selected as the site of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the future headquarters of that Institute are now in the final stages of constriction and will be inaugurated in the near future. We encourage all States Members of the Organization to contribute to the trust fund for the Institute.\n51.\tThe problem of food supply is developing at the same pace as that of population growth. For that reason, the entire world should recognize the importance of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It is therefore regrettable that after almost 11 years of devotion to the work of establishing scientific principles to govern that inexhaustible source of wealth, it has not yet been possible to complete the final instrument that would be a source of salvation for the human race, threatened as it is with shortage in the near future of the resources that are indispensable for its survival and progress. Therefore, regardless of the reasons for the failure to complete the final debates and to move next year to the signature of the longed for convention on the law of the sea,, it would seem desirable to sign the proposed convention at Caracas next year, as soon as possible after next year's sessions in New York.\n52.\tPopulation growth in the world undeniably constitutes a problem that makes imperative the vigorous and decisive mobilization of all production resources. Based on those convictions, the Government of the Dominican Republic has been encouraging agrarian reform and is devoting particular attention to agro-industry.\n53.\tMany years ago a famous Dominican writer and politician, Ulises Francisco Espaillat, father of independence and President of my country, had the foresight to point out the importance of agriculture for our nation. He declared with inspiring authority that work must be glorified and that of all industries agriculture was the easiest, the most useful, the most generous and the most fruitful. This exemplary Dominican added with patriotic ardor that it was the most noble industry, the industry that most effectively provided that independence of position most suitable for citizens who wish to remain free and independent.\n54.\tThe economy of the Dominican Republic has not escaped the widespread effects of convulsions in other economies, which result from the irrepressible forces of this historic period of emerging decisions, a period that is irresistibly striving towards a new economic order as we approach the year 2000. Nevertheless, the efforts made by our Government during the last three years though troubled in part, especially by the forces of nature thanks to the pragmatic actions of Antonio Guzman, head of the Dominican State, show a normal situation in the national economy, in the context of free enterprise and the full force and effect of public freedoms.\n55.\tA cautious monetary and fiscal policy is being carried out. The fiscal policy provides for adjustment of public expenditures to the income from taxes; under the monetary policy, unduly rapid expansion of the money supply has been brought under control and the money has been channeled chiefly towards the productive sectors, particularly agriculture and industry.\n56.\tAn aggressive policy to promote nontraditional exports is being followed and is producing positive results;. It should be mentioned that under a recent law, generous incentives are given to the exporters of nontraditional products. One such incentive permits them to retain a portion of the foreign currencies earned by these exports, paying to the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic only an officially predetermined percentage.\n57.\tToday more than ever we must keep in mind the mandate of the Creator of the Universe that man must earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow. Thus, the divine work extends to the urgent mandate to win peace with the energy of our mortal, human blood. We venture to say that this is the primary challenge of our age, starting with our presence here at this time to fulfill a transcendent promise. The General Assembly must go in search of solutions required by conflicts that we cannot allow to continue and become chronic. A final explosion could jeopardize the very existence of the Organization, which is the only constructive institution created by the last world war. A repetition of that conflict must be prevented at all costs.\n58.\tTo conclude these reflections, we should like to call to mind the third encyclical of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, entitled Laborem Exercens, dedicated to those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, to workers of all kinds, manual, intellectual, industrial or agricultural, who labor in the midst of the most intense, sudden and ominous tensions.\n59.\tIn the midst of their debates, delegations at this thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly should meditate on the exhortation contained in the vary word \\\"work\\\" which has come down through the ages as a perpetual and resolute echo of the voice of God.\n"

        "file_text": "94.\tM: Nearly 36 years ago, the United Nations was founded on the ashes of fascism with the lofty objective of saving \\\"succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". Unhappily, the same evil forces which this world body was set up. to suppress, and to which my country was the first to fail victim, are today seen rearing their frightful heads again.\n95.\tEven as we gather here in solemn conclave, sabre-rattling warmongers are, either directly or through their paid agents, engaged in a savage massacre of men, women and children around the world, and all in the name of justice and democracy. Hypocrisy echoes in these hallowed halls. Are we, under these circumstances, to regard ourselves as helpless victims of these messengers of doom and destruction? Are we to succumb to them? We say no.\n96.\tIn the light of the gravity of the problems confronting the world today, we should resist the temptation to view the current session of the General Assembly as an annual ritual to be marked by the usual pious expressions of commitment to United Nations principles, utterances which in practical terms mean precious little.\n97.\tIt is against that background that the special meaning and significance of our deliberations here must be viewed. We must address ourselves resolutely and courageously to the challenging problems of our time. Our destiny is in our own hands to make or mar; the choice is ours.\n98.\tMr. President, you are burdened with a heavy and onerous responsibility. I should, therefore, like to congratulate you on your accession to the presidency of this important session. We are more than confident that our proceedings are in safe hands under your able guidance.\n99.\tI should like also to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Ethiopian delegation to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar for his outstanding performance in guiding the thirty-fifth session and the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly to fruitful conclusions.\n\n100.\tI should further like to express the appreciation of my delegation to the Secretary-General for his untiring dedication to the promotion of the cause of the Organization.\n101.\tMy delegation also wishes to congratulate the newly independent States of Vanuatu and Belize on their joining the Organization. The family of independent nations is growing, and this gives us added comfort and solace.\n102.\tThe world today finds itself in a most precarious state. We are passing through a tense and traumatic period. Not only does the international situation leave much to be desired, but it also gives rise to serious misgivings about the very survival of mankind. Ours is a period that is increasingly plagued by a host of pressing problems. The spectre of a holocaust of hitherto unknown proportions haunts us daily.\n103.\tWe are witnessing the perpetration of the vilest forms of crime by those who have arrogated to themselves the role of champions of human rights and justice abroad, while many of their own people at home suffer from poverty in a society that otherwise wallows in affluence as far as the privileged masters are concerned. Nor should we overlook the fact that this sad state of affairs stems from deliberate racist policies.\n104.\tInternational imperialism and the forces of reaction are at work today much more diligently than ever before. They are bending over backwards to translate into deeds their bizarre vision of the world, a world they want to fashion in their own image so as to make it amenable to their grand design of total domination. Millions of people are today deprived of their inalienable rights to freedom and independence. Nowhere is this made more manifest than in southern Africa, where racists, in close collaboration with their patrons in the West, are keeping Africans in bondage. Take the case of Namibia.\n105.\tTime has long been running out as regards Namibian independence. It has become more than evident that the racist and terrorist regime in Pretoria cannot reconcile itself to the course that history inexorably takes. It does not heed common sense either. Armed struggle is the ultima ratio, the only language the bigots are able to understand.\n106.\tInternational imperialism, spearheaded by the United States, has today more than ever before intensified its futile efforts to halt and reverse the process of national liberation and social emancipation in southern Africa. As a result, the independence of Namibia has long been overdue. The succor and comfort provided by imperialism are keeping racist Pretoria strong and alive.\n107.\tThe people of Namibia today find themselves in a tragic state of affairs. Solemn statements of support for them have been reverberating in these halls for years, but they have meant little in practical terms. What was needed was to bring the racists to their senses. That having failed, the bigots must now be brought to their knees.\n108.\tIt is imperative, therefore, that Namibia regain its independence by early 1982 at the latest. That is a must. Otherwise there will be no more talks. The so-called contact group of five Western countries has so far been skilfully employing delaying tactics to make Namibia in particular and southern Africa in general safe for apartheid. We deplore and condemn these evil machinations. An end has to be put to them.\n109.\tRecent events indicate that the alliance between racism in southern Africa and imperialism is being further strengthened. Internationally recognized national liberation movements that are struggling for freedom and independence are being unabashedly dubbed terrorists, ironically by the same forces as have all along aided and abetted terrorism and raised it to the level of State policy in southern Africa. The prevailing trend has undoubtedly emboldened the terrorist regime of Pretoria to go to the extent of openly invading the sister People's Republic of Angola, thereby threatening the other countries in the front line of the African struggle. The United Nations has been purposely rendered inactive in the face of such lawlessness by the veto power of the United States, which has come out openly and shamelessly in support of racism and the heinous policy of apartheid. The United States has unmasked its true character and exposed its violent opposition to the freedom of Africans by vetoing in the Security Council on 31 August 19814 a draft resolution condemning South Africa's invasion of the People's Republic of Angola. That was a demonstration of arrogance and refusal to abide by the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n110.\tSouth Africa's invasion and occupation of Angola was, by any standard, savage and barbaric. The support given by the United States to that criminal act is no less shameful and deplorable. The marriage of interests between the United States and apartheid South Africa has become glaringly clear in that it is aimed at strengthening terrorist mercenaries in Angola and creating a buffer zone for the destabilization of that independent African State.\n111.\tIt has been stated ad nauseam that apartheid is an affront to humanity and as such is contrary to the principles of the Charter. It has also been said time and again that that wretched system should be brought to an end. How? Those who claim a monopoly over wisdom repeatedly tell us that what is needed is time. Time until when? The answer is, naturally, until the extermination of Africans is effectively completed. The candor of the advocates of such a strategy is disarming.\n112.\tThe United States is a country that prides itself on having overthrown colonial rule through armed struggle. However, this same country today labels freedom fighters in southern Africa, who happen to be black, as terrorists. The founding fathers of this land must today be turning in their graves in agony and anguish. It is quite evident that the present Administration in the United States has struck a deal with the enemies of humanity.\n113.\tWe should all strengthen and augment our support for and solidarity with all those struggling for their inalienable rights to freedom in South Africa and Namibia. The terrorist regime of Pretoria should be evicted from Namibia by every means possible. The international community owes it to itself to support in every possible way the struggle for racial equality and majority rule within South Africa. The international community cannot escape the responsibility of assisting morally and materially Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and all the other front-line States in their struggle to ensure respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity, It is therefore imperative that the Assembly not only strongly condemn the apartheid regime of Pretoria for its wanton act of aggression but also demand immediate, effective and adequate payment of reparations to Angola for the damage inflicted on that country. An aggressor should not be allowed to get away with it. Ethiopia, for its part, will not fail to meet its obligation in that struggle.\n114.\tSocialist Ethiopia will continue to extend support and assistance to SWAPO, the sole legitimate' representative of the Namibian people, and to the ANC until the final elimination of colonialism and racism from both Namibia and South Africa.\n115.\tIn the region to which my own country belongs, United States imperialism is feverishly engaged in stifling progressive movements and undermining sovereign States and their leaders. Each and every spot on the map of the region is supposed to be within the sphere of influence of the United States. We are being daily threatened by United States imperialism. There are some 10 United States military bases in and around our region alone. These keep a constant watch on countries in the region which are not amenable to Washington's diktat. The now all-too-familiar bogy being employed is, of course, the Soviet threat. None, except those who worship the demigod in Washington, will be fooled by such a smokescreen.\n116.\tWe are in constant danger. It is no mere threat; it is a fact of daily life. Those wishing to regain lost spheres of influence are endangering our very survival. We have to put up with such arrogance of power in order to survive.\n117.\tMy country has just celebrated the seventh anniversary of the eruption of its epoch-making popular revolution. As my head of State, Comrade Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam, noted in his nationwide address on the occasion: ^\n\\\"Ours is a revolution that has ushered in an era of prosperity, equality and justice by dismantling the age old oppressive monarchical system by means of the finest heritage of valor, heroism and revolutionary struggle in the fight for freedom.\\\"\n118.\tWith respect to the conflict in the Horn of Africa, it is gratifying to note that the OAU has given its final verdict. It is, therefore, up to the parties concerned to abide by that decision and faithfully implement its provisions.\n119.\tOurs is a region which has been tormented for far too long. In contemporary history, just as in previous centuries, Ethiopia has been the chosen victim of repeated waves of aggression. The OAU, at the eighteenth session of its Assembly of Heads of State and Government, held at Nairobi, emphatically pronounced itself on the persisting conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia. In his report to this Assembly on the activities of the OAU, the current Chairman of the OAU Assembly, Mr. Daniel T. Arap Moi, President of the Republic of Kenya, said:\n\\\"The report of the Good Offices Committee which had been established by the OAU was received and endorsed at the Nairobi summit meeting, and all of us are now fervently hoping for an era of peace. This would not be hard to introduce and to sustain if both sides would formally recognize and apply the fundamental OAU principle in regard to the sovereignty of independent States, respect for boundaries as existing at the time of independence, and noninterference in the internal affairs of other States.\\\" [11th meeting, para, 34.]\n120.\tIt is my distinct honor to declare to the General Assembly here and now, as the delegation of Ethiopia unequivocally did at the OAU Assembly meeting at Nairobi, that Ethiopia fully accepts the decision and is ready to implement its provisions. But the new era of peace and stability in the region can become a reality only when there is an equal commitment on the part of Somalia to respect accepted principles and norms of international behavior. This calls, first and foremost, for the abandonment of the policy of war as an instrument for the advancement of parochial self-seeking objectives. Furthermore, a new era of peace and stability cannot be ushered in by the rearming of a belligerent State and the establishment of military bases, or by the deployment of a rapid intervention force in that country.\n121.\tOur efforts at lifting ourselves up from abysmal poverty are being bedeviled at every stage by obstacles placed in our way by imperialist forces which are constantly fomenting instability and insecurity in our part of the world. We have therefore had little or no time to address ourselves in earnest to the crucial task of economic development and social transformation. Indeed, our detractors have been showering us with lectures on the wisdom of self-help. Despite their prophecies to the contrary, I am glad to state here that we face a bright future,\n122.\tNor has Ethiopia's constructive role been confined to the national domain. My country has actively contributed to the strengthening of peace by ceaselessly fighting against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, expansionism, oppression and exploitation in all its forms. To this end, apart from the amicable understanding it has forged with almost all its neighbors, my country has signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation with the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Various sinister interpretations have been placed on this amicable accord of cooperation among the three peace-loving fraternal countries. The treaty aims at promoting cooperation, peace and stability in our region. It is not directed against anyone. What the three countries have resolved to do is to work in close collaboration on the basis of an anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist and anti-racist stand. It is as clear as that. By no stretch of the imagination can this be interpreted as anything other than a major contribution to the strengthening of peace and the promotion of AfroArab cooperation.\n123.\tThe thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place against the disturbing background of rapid escalation of tension, the reversal of detente and a resurgence of the cold war, bringing the world closer than ever before to a nuclear conflagration. The crisis of consensus, consciously cultivated, advanced and utilized by the Reagan Administration in the United States, has reached new and increasingly dangerous heights, resulting in the stalemate we now face in nearly all international endeavors, including the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the independence of Namibia, the elimination of apartheid in South Africa, the restoration of the rights of the Palestinians, the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean, all disarmament negotiations and the launching of global negotiations for the establishment of the new international economic order.\n124.\tIn these and in other areas of collective international endeavor, we find ample and vivid demonstrations of imperialists' attempts to impose their will on each and every corner of the globe. The massive military buildup, the stockpiling and deployment of nuclear weapons, the acquisition of new military bases and the expansion of existing ones, the formation of rapid intervention forces, interference in the internal affairs of States, the use or threat of force and provocative military maneuvers characterize the present international scene.\n125.\tThe danger inherent in the production, stockpiling and deployment of nuclear weapons is rendered more acute by the advancement of absurd military doctrines advocating the feasibility and even the desirability of limited nuclear war. The decision to go ahead with the production of the most inhuman weapon, the neutron bomb, and the deployment of mediumrange nuclear missiles in Europe have further increased the danger of nuclear conflagration.\n126.\tThe imperialists' practice of arrogating to themselves the right to dominate and to declare any part of the world an area of vital interest to themselves has been coupled with a massive military buildup in and around the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, threatening not only the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States of the region but also international peace and security as a whole,\n127.\tThere is no doubt today that the new Administration of the United States is bent on dominating the peoples of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and that to this end it has diverted vast resources from the social needs of its own people for the purpose of producing ever more deadly weapons of mass destruction, thus opening a new round in the arms race. Moreover, the United States' arrogant attempt to ensure its domination over our part of the world has been made clear by its strategic alliances in the Middle East and with racist South Africa. We derive comfort from the fact that the American people are opposed to such an anti-peace policy,\n128.\tThere have been many open provocations and outright interventions. One such incident with regard to which Ethiopia expresses its profound indignation and strong condemnation is the recent wanton and premeditated aggression committed against a fellow African State, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Military maneuvers, whether conducted in the Mediterranean or the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean or the Caribbean, can be viewed only as intolerable provocation that increases the anxiety of the peoples of the region; for these hostile activities have grave implications for the security and independence of small nations on which new and critical defense requirements are thoughtlessly imposed.\n129.\tThe pursuit of military superiority at any cost will result not in the attainment of the goal cherished by the cold warriors, but rather in the senseless escalation of the arms race, bringing mankind closer to the brink of annihilation. The choice before us was spell-out in 1978 at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, the Final Document of which stated: \\\"Mankind is confronted with a choice: we must halt the arms race and proceed to disarmament or face annihilation.\\\" [Resolution S10/2, para. 18.]\n130.\tClearly, the choice the new Administration in Washington has made for mankind appears to be the one leading to annihilation. The imminent danger with which the world is faced is unmistakably the danger of nuclear war. For this reason, J wish to express the Ethiopian delegation's strong support for the Soviet proposals aimed at the prevention of a nuclear catastrophe, We regard this as an extremely important and timely proposal, for now is the time to act in the interest of mankind; it may soon be too late.\n131.\tWith regard to the problem of Western Sahara, it is our sincere desire that the parties concerned will implement the decision of the OAU Assembly at its latest session at Nairobi this year.\n132.\tThe Middle East remains a thorny problem. Israel's continued occupation of Arab lands and its defiant denial of the rights of the Palestinian people, as well as its repeated acts of aggression against peaceful Lebanon, cannot but be attributed to the boundless support it receives from Washington. The strategic alliance between the United States, Israel and South Africa is nothing but the consolidation of an imperialist-racist axis threatening the freedom and independence of the States of the region and preventing the restoration of the rights of millions. Ethiopia will continue to extend its solidarity to the Palestinian people in order that they may be able to regain their inalienable right to independence and establish their own State. We also uphold the view that the Arab territories occupied since 1967 should be vacated immediately by Israel.\n133.\tIt is sad to note that repeated crimes are being committed against peaceful Lebanon by a neighbor that is armed to the teeth. A free and sovereign State has been subjected to naked aggression. As a victim of similar aggressions, both in the distant past and in recent years, my own country views these criminal acts with indignation. The unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon must be duly respected.\n134.\tEthiopia welcomes the resumption of the inter-communal talks in Cyprus and earnestly hopes that those talks will lead to the restoration of unity and stability, as well as to the strengthening of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and nonaligned status of that country.\n135.\tWith regard to the situation in SouthEast and SouthWest Asia, it is our considered opinion that peace and amity could be achieved among the peoples of the regions concerned if only the forces of imperialism and reaction were to cease their self-serving interference. Afghanistan has become a clear victim of an international conspiracy that is being orchestrated into an immense crescendo. This is no wonder. The interests of imperialism are at stake. A proposal has been put forward by Afghanistan for the peaceful settlement of the political problem in that region. Let us give the people directly concerned a chance to solve the problem. Let us not pretend to be more qualified to speak on their behalf.\n136.\tViet Nam and Kampuchea are two other countries that today are targets of aggression by international imperialism and hegemonistic forces. It is regrettable that after having struggled hard for so long and after having won a decisive victory against United States imperialism, the heroic people of Viet Nam have today been called upon to put up yet another fight against forces of international reaction and expansionism in that part of the world. Startling revelations have just been made about the extent of the harm done that country as a result of the biological and chemical warfare employed by the United States in the vain hope of vanquishing the patriots of that gallant land. We again condemn those acts. We are of the view that lasting peace can be restored, both in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea, if only the people concerned are left on their own, without any form of imperialist meddling. For its part, socialist Ethiopia extends its solidarity and support to these fraternal States.\n137.\tEthiopia supports the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas and welcomes all initiatives to this end.\n138.\tIn Latin America, imperialism has publicly expressed its determination to isolate and stifle the revolutionary and progressive States of Cuba, Nicaragua and Grenada. Fraternal Cuba, in particular, has been blockaded for over 20 years and is daily threatened and bullied by the United States. We deplore this blockade and call for the liquidation of the Guantanamo base. Cuba is also being subjected to an inhuman form of warfare which has unleashed a major epidemic in that country leading to the death of many, among them innocent children. This is hauntingly reminiscent of fascism's use of poison gas against the Ethiopian people on the eve of the Second World War. It is being claimed that the epidemic in question has been brought to Cuba from Africa by Cuban internationalists returning home. This is not only a patent lie, it is also vividly racist in its overtones. No less an authority than WHO has come out with a conclusive verdict that no such disease exists in Africa.\n139.\tThe imperialist policy being pursued by Washington has provoked the anger and indignation of all peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples everywhere. It is our inescapable duty to warn against the threats to peace posed by the policy of imperialist resurgence and domination. This threat must be fought, and fought with courage and determination, if we are to build a new world order based on peace, freedom, democracy and justice.\n140.\tIt is therefore incumbent on all of us, especially the nonaligned countries, to exert every effort to stop the further deterioration of the international situation resulting from the policy of imperialist expansion and domination. We are confident that, consistent with its fundamental anti-imperialist character, the nonaligned movement, which has just commemorated its twentieth anniversary, will redouble its efforts in the pursuit of peace based on freedom and justice.\n141.\tIn the economic sphere, the relationship between the developing countries and the industrialized countries is still suffering from the consequences of the existing unjust and inequitable world economic order. The current global economic crisis is nothing more than a reflection of underlying structural maladjustment and the persisting lack of equity in international economic relations.\n142.\tMy delegation, for one, believes that as long as the industrialized world persists in the maintenance of an international economic relationship based on the old hegemonic order that perpetuates injustice, inequality, exploitation and dependency, it will certainly continue to affect adversely the development prospects of the developing countries, as well as the future of the world as a whole.\n143.\tIn this connection, we note with regret that the long-awaited completion of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been stalled owing to lack of cooperation on the part of the United States. Nevertheless,, the international community cannot and should not allow any country, however powerful it may be, to scuttle the most important international conference ever convened by the United Nations. It is therefore our firm conviction that the Convention on the Law of the Sea should be finalized as soon as possible.\n144.\tAccording to studies conducted by various United Nations agencies, the economic performance of the least developed countries in the last decade was very pathetic. Gloomy as the picture of the past performance of these countries has been, the international community still continues to witness today an even more disquieting picture.\n145.\tThe least developed countries have not only become the primary victims of the convulsion that has rocked the world economy but have also remained victims of the major natural and man-made disasters that have constantly visited our planet during the last 10 years. A phenomenon of this kind certainly jeopardizes the development efforts of these countries by forcing them to divert funds and other resources from development programs to food imports and rehabilitation. The international community, therefore, has an urgent and special responsibility to redress the plight of these countries before the situation reaches the breaking point. We therefore urge all countries, especially the developed countries, to implement speedily the Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the least developed countries, which, we hope, will ameliorate the situation to a certain extent.\n146.\tFailure on the part of the international community to do so will manifest itself not only in the continued suffering and deprivation of our peoples but also in dire political terms, the responsibility for which will lie with us. If we abandon our endeavor to rectify the existing injustice in international economic relations, we shall have all failed in our moral and political responsibilities.\n147.\tViewed from whatever angle, the world is uneasily poised on the brink of a major disaster which can be avoided only if the situation is quickly rectified. Our part of the world in particular is being increasingly plagued by a host of problems which are deliberately fomented and fanned by international imperialism and the concomitant forces of reaction. Imperialist military bases designed for aggression are mushrooming daily in the area. The chariots of war, let loose and rampant, are arrogantly parading from all directions with characteristic bravado. Referring to the grave danger facing the world today, my Head of State, Comrade Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam, stressed that:\n\\\"The peace of the world is today more than ever before seriously endangered. Instead of the advancement of human welfare and civilization, we observe heavy war clouds on the horizon. The basic aim of imperialism being the obstruction of human development, it manifests itself in the local wars it unleashes from time to time. It is the standard tactic of imperialism to create confusing situations in order to give these wars a semblance of legality.\\\"\n148.\tThe people of Ethiopia, having consolidated the gains of their popular revolution and having attained stability and tranquility, have now embarked on a relentless war against poverty, disease, ignorance and backwardness. My country is thus firmly committed to the promotion of peace and security in our region in particular and throughout the world in general.\n149.\tThe peoples of the world have the paramount duty to join hands and stand together in the honorable crusade against backwardness and the threat of war. The hour is grave and the challenge formidable. The choice, is clear: we either survive or perish together. Happily enough, hopes have not been entirely dashed. Given good will, common sense can prevail in the supreme interest of mankind survival.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "179.\t  Let me first of all, Sir, express my warm congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. As a colleague, I am familiar with your outstanding qualities and I am sure that your guidance will be a major factor in channeling our deliberations and work towards constructive ends.\n180.\tI wish also to express our appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. von*Wechmar, who earned the admiration of all of us by the manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the previous session. We wish him success in his new mission.\n181.\tI should like, finally, to express to the Secretary General our deep appreciation for the persistent efforts he is deploying in furtherance of our shared objectives.\n182.\tWe warmly welcome Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu. I extend to the Governments and peoples of Vanuatu and Belize our sincere wishes for progress and prosperity.\n183.\tAs we meet in the General Assembly each year we express our perceptions of world problems, our expectations, our concerns and our anxieties. As global problems have proliferated, the consensus that has emerged is that their solutions are possible only through universal cooperation. This interdependence should bring us closer together. On the other hand, we remain divided by parochial attitudes, prejudices and divergent interests, some real, some reflecting longstanding suspicions and mistrust. The nuclear holocaust haunts the human race. But this does not deter some countries from resorting to force and to threats of recourse to force. The awesome issues we face require understanding, tolerance and dedication to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. If our deliberations and the contacts which the United Nations meetings make possible can contribute, even in a modest way, to promoting progress in this direction, our efforts will not be in vain.\n184.\tFor some years now an atmosphere of pessimism and gloom has pervaded our meetings. During the past year tensions have continued unabated and have been exacerbated by the reckless behaviour of some countries, particularly in the Middle East. The process of detente has been seriously undermined by the infringement of the ' principles of the Helsinki Final Act. The world economy, for developed and developing countries alike, is plagued by serious crises. It suffers from the absence of a determined move towards a more just international economic order.\n185.\tMany intractable problems are being discussed in the United Nations. The solution to them has been frustrated for many years. However, one glimmer of hope is that in some instances a breakthrough may be achieved if the parties involved can work out reasonable negotiating positions.\n\n186.\tOne such example is the question of Cyprus. We all know the long history of the drama of that island since 1963, as well as the troubled course of the negotiations between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities.\n187.\tRecently an important, perhaps crucial, crossroads was reached in the intercommunal talks, which have been under way without interruption for over a year now under the auspices of the SecretaryGeneral and in accordance with his opening statement of 9 August 1980.3 That fact in itself augurs well for the future. The SecretaryGeneral's determined efforts towards a settlement in Cyprus are most commendable. I wish to reiterate my Government's full support for his mission of good offices in the intercommunal talks.\n188.\tThe Government of Hirkey notes with much satisfaction that on 5 August 1981 [A/36/702] the Ibrkish Cypriot side submitted comprehensive proposals on all aspects of the problem. In search of a just and lasting settlement, these include proposals on the future constitutional structure as well as on territory. It is particularly significant that the Ibrkish Cypriot proposals on territory are embodied in a map. Thus the longstanding Greek Cypriot demand that the Ibrkish Cypriots should submit a map has been met. \n189.\tThe Turkish Government appreciates the sacrifice made by the Turkish community and the considerable risk it has assumed in undertaking this initiative by presenting such comprehensive proposals without insisting on reciprocal conditions. The Turkish community did so out of its commitment to a negotiated settlement and in the belief that progress is possible only if the two sides engage in earnest give and take.\n190.\tNotwithstanding the fearful memories of the brutal past and of the days of oppression and discrimination they have experienced, the Turkish Cypriots in a bold move have offered to the Greek Cypriots reconciliation and partnership. This is indeed a historic moment. It should not be allowed to slip away by those who succumb to policies of procrastination because of their lack of vision or their vested interest in the maintenance of the status quo.\n191.\tThe time is most propitious for the Greek Cypriot side to reciprocate with meaningful counter-proposals to enable the negotiating process to gain momentum towards a settlement. Such a solution, ac cording to the well known position of my Government, must ensure the fundamental rights of the Turkish Cypriot community, which aspires to live side by side as an equal partner with the Greek Cypriot community in a bi-communal and bi-zonal State, which could wisely adopt a policy of nonalignment if it so wished.\n*\n192.\tIn Cyprus there has been another encouraging development in the past year, namely, the agreement reached between the two communities to establish a committee for the investigation of the fate of missing persons. This shows that when the two sides act with patience and perseverance and refrain from polemics, progress is possible even in highly sensitive areas. That committee is expected to achieve real progress, provided that all parties act in conformity with the terms of reference agreed upon.\n193.\tA settlement of the Cyprus problem would no doubt greatly improve the atmosphere in the relations between Turkey and Greece, which have special links with the two communities on the island and great stakes in a Cypriot settlement. They are not, however, directly involved in the inter-communal negotiating process. Theirs is a moral obligation to facilitate and encourage the inter-communal dialog in any way they can.\n194.\tOn the other hand, Turkey and Greece continue to be beset by serious problems in their bilateral relations. Since 1976 they have been engaged in a process of negotiation to resolve them. Turkey, for its part, has done all it can to inject a conciliatory spirit into these negotiations. Despite the frustrating lack of progress in this dialog so far, Turkey will persevere in negotiations, hoping that eventually avenues will be opened for constructive results. But it is imperative that while the negotiating process is under way both parties exercise the utmost restraint.\n195.\tThe temptations to try for faits accomplis or unilateral advantages should be strongly resisted if grave consequences are to be avoided. The rational path for both countries is to continue their dialog with balanced perceptions, taking each other's interests into account.\n196.\tThere is a truly universal problem which has in recent years reached alarming and unprecedented levels. I am referring to international terrorism. Throughout the world, in many societies of otherwise vast differences, terrorism is taking a high toll of innocent human lives, challenging stability, disrupting daily life and endangering the territorial integrity of nations.\n197.\tA clarification is in order before I proceed, since the word \\\"terrorism\\\" can have different meanings for different people. We certainly do not consider as terrorist activities the national liberation struggles recognized by the United Nations and international regional organizations. We support the legitimate struggle of national liberation movements against all forms of colonialism, foreign occupation and oppression. Terrorism, as we understand it, involves those illegal acts directed against the social stability and territorial integrity of existing States. This type of terrorism aims at the disintegration of societies through chaos and anarchy.\n198.\tIt is this scourge that has afflicted my country the past few years, shaking the very fabric of Turkish society and infiltrating all of its sectors and institutions. Thousands of innocent persons have fallen as its victims. Prior to September last year an average of 20 people had been losing their lives every day as a result of terrorist acts. Our social structure faced disintegration, while political life was totally paralyzed. It was this anarchy and violence which prompted the military intervention of 12 September 1980. Since then, the overriding task of my Government has been the fight against terrorism.\n199.\tThis fight is being carried on with perseverance. So far the achievement is as impressive as the disclosures are shocking. The illegal arms and ammunition captured have reached astonishing levels. By 15 August 1981 the number of small arms confiscated totaled 730,574, and over 5 million rounds of ammunition had been seized. Confiscated illegal weapons even include rocket launchers and howitzers. Such a stock of arms and ammunition could easily equip an entire army.\n200.\tWe in Turkey are about to win this struggle against terrorism on such an incredible scale. Turkish society is once again free from fear and enjoying its basic right  the right to life. But our findings clearly indicate that terrorism of this magnitude could not have been organized with only domestic means and resources. In fact, terrorism in Turkey was financed and supported clandestinely from abroad. As long as violence is backed by one or more foreign States, there will be other societies in the future which will also be victimized.\n201.\tInternational terrorism is a threat not only to individual countries but also to the orderly conduct of international relations. Assaults against diplomats and diplomatic missions around the world have become frequent occurrences. Turkish diplomats have been the foremost targets of brutal acts of terrorism. Only last week the Turkish Consulate in Paris became the most recent target of a violent attack by terrorists. This senseless act resulted in a tragedy involving the murder of an official and the wounding of a diplomat.\n202.\tGeneral Assembly resolution 35/168, on the protection of diplomatic and consular agents and premises, is an important step. We hope that this resolution will provide for the beginning of comprehensive international cooperation. Turkey reaffirms its readiness to provide full cooperation for the adoption of effective measures for the prevention and suppression of all acts of terrorism. We urge the United Nations to take specific steps to combat this kind of violence, We call upon all countries to take a categorical stand against terrorist acts whenever and wherever they occur under whatever pretext. All countries should also individually strengthen their measures against terrorism at the national level. They should further promote bilateral and regional cooperation. Among concrete measures, appropriate arrangements could be considered for the control of small arms sales between private companies.\n203.\tIn this context I should like to touch upon the question of drug abuse, to which Turkey has always attached primary importance. The problem directly concerns the social stability and national security of nations. It has reached alarming levels and should no longer be tolerated. We have repeatedly drawn the attention of the international community to the threat posed by drug abuse and called for concerted action against this evil. As we have said on many occasions, there are strong links between arms smuggling and drug trafficking. There are strong indications that the same underground organizations are engaged in both activities.\n204.\tIt is with these considerations in mind that we welcome the inclusion in the agenda of an item proposed by Bolivia, entitled \\\"International campaign against traffic in drugs\\\" [item 129}. We believe that the United Nations should look into this problem in all its aspects, with particular reference to the links between arms smuggling and illicit traffic in drugs.\n205.\tRelations between East and West have suffered setbacks in recent years. At a time when the overall East West relationship is very strained, it is of particular importance to revive the process of negotiations on arms control and disarmament. For these negotiations, if successful, can enhance security at lower levels of armaments and, at the same time, help sustain the process of detente by providing tangible benefits through dialog.\n206.\tWe therefore welcome the joint decision of the United States and the USSR, reached during last week's meeting between Secretary of State Haig and Foreign Minister Gromyko, to begin negotiations on nuclear arms later in the year. We hope that these talks will pave the way for the limitation and substantial reduction in tactical nuclear forces as well as in strategic nuclear arms.\n207.\tAnother component of the dialog between the East and the West is the follow-up to the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Turkey earnestly hopes that it will prove feasible to achieve an agreement in Madrid on a balanced and substantial concluding document, including a mandate for a European disarmament conference. This proposed conference in Europe could be a major qualitative step in the process of confidence-building, which is indispensable for successful disarmament efforts.\n208.\tI should like to state once again our objectives in the field of arms control. We strongly  favor the continuation of the talks on strategic nuclear arms. We support the efforts for the achievement of a multilateral comprehensive test-ban treaty. We attach importance to the conclusion of a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. We endorse the evolution of an effective non proliferation regime based on the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We share the objective of limiting and reducing conventional forces, and in particular a mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Europe.\n209. Turkey remains committed to those objectives. Turkey is also eager to bring its contribution to the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We expect that session to produce tangible progress by facilitating worldwide disarmament negotiations, defining the conceptual framework for those negotiations and setting the criteria and principles for carrying out the important preparatory work.\n21Q. The complex situation in the Middle East continues to be of central concern to the entire international community. It contains an explosive potential for a conflict threatening world peace. By virtue of its geographical location as well as its historical close ties with the countries of the region, TUrkey has been following with particular concern the increasing tensions in the area. From this rostrum, Turkey has on several occasions made clear its firm stand on the question of Palestine, which constitutes the core of the Middle East conflict. I want to reaffirm that we consider the following elements to be indispensable for a comprehensive, lasting and just settlement: withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Al Quds Al Sharif; recognition and realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to establish an independent State in their own territory; the right of every State in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries; the participation of the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, in all peace efforts on an equal footing with the other interested parties to the conflict; and the maintenance of the Arab and Islamic character of the Holy City of Al Quds Al Sharif, and the rejection of the arbitrary unilateral change in its status, which is a flagrant violation of international law.\n211.\tIt is encouraging that the countries of the region are displaying fresh interest in and eagerness for a comprehensive settlement, which is long overdue. The plan recently put forward by the Government of Saudi Arabia is a case in point. The overall positive reaction it has received in the region reaffirms that the Arab countries are prepared to seek a just peace.\n212.\tIn addition, the efforts of the European Community for a comprehensive settlement are commendable. If pursued, they promise to make valuable contributions to the quest for peace. We were gratified to hear last week [8th meeting] from Lord Carrington, the current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, that the members of the Community will pursue their efforts energetically to promote a peaceful settlement.\n213.\tYet if all those efforts are to be given a chance, there must be a fundamental change in the present policies of the Government of Israel. In the course of the past year it has become all the more evident that Israeli policies based on aggression, intransigence and arrogance constitute the principal source of tension and instability in the Middle East. In a demonstration of incredible shortsightedness, Israel recklessly imperils its avowed objective of living peacefully with its neighbors. No nation has ever been able to attain security for itself through the annexation of territory, the denial of the rights of others and a self-righteous rejection of the legitimate interests of its neighbors.\n214.\tDuring conflicts, acts of violence serve only to complicate the search for a settlement. In utter disregard of this basic fact, Israel has escalated and widened its attacks in recent months. The premeditated aggression against the nuclear reactor in Iraq and the indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon demonstrate that Israel recognizes no limits to its policy bent on domination.\n215.\tIndeed, the Israeli intervention in Lebanon tremendously complicates the fragile and tenuous situation in that country. Turkey believes that an end to the human suffering in Lebanon can only be secured within a framework that would ensure the unity, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country. We welcome and support the valuable work of the quadripartite committee of the League of Arab States towards that objective. The ceasefire in southern Lebanon has been a positive achievement. We hope that all parties will cooperate with UNIFIL to enable it to carry out its mandate in southern Lebanon.\n216.\tThe ongoing war between Iraq and Iran constitutes another threat to peace and security in the region. Those countries are our neighbors, with whom we have historical ties of friendship, and we feel distressed to see them remain engaged in armed hostility. The war offers nothing other than more suffering, damage and destabilization. It must, therefore, be brought to a speedy end. Turkey has maintained strict neutrality with regard to the conflict. We have shown the utmost care to observe that neutrality and will continue to do so. We have also taken an active part in the multilateral efforts to bring about a reconciliation between our two neighbors within the Peace Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. We shall pursue those efforts. We appreciate the parallel initiatives of the SecretaryGeneral as well as those of nonaligned countries in search of peace between Iran and Iraq.\n217.\tIn the face of turmoil and disunity in the area, the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council has been a most timely initiative. Turkey fully supports the objectives of its founding members in this undertaking.\n218.\tThe tragic situation in Afghanistan is a source of particular concern and distress for Turkey. Turks have enjoyed a common history, traditional friendship and fraternal bonds with the Afghan people. We strongly wish that their tragedy would soon come to an end. However, the situation created by outside intervention in Afghanistan in breach of the Charter of the United Nations remains unchanged. It poses a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability. Turkey believes that only a political solution can be found to this crisis. Such a settlement should restore to the Afghan people their righi to self government and ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country, as well as the cessation of all foreign interference. There have been several recent efforts to achieve a solution. We support the initiatives of the Islamic Conference, the European Community and the SecretaryGeneral in this field.\n219.\tThe pressing problems in southern Africa still await solution. As a founding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, Hirkey follows the prevailing situation in southern Africa with anxiety and apprehension.\n220.\tThe illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa is an impermissible act which cannot be condoned under any pretext or justification. We extend unreserved support to the people of Namibia in their arduous struggle to achieve self-determination, freedom and national independence under their legitimate representative, SWAPO. A peaceful solution in Namibia can come about only through the implementation of the United Nations plan in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The breakdown of the pre-implementation meeting at Geneva last January, because of South African intransigence, has delayed the implementation of that resolution. We are satisfied that the five nations that make up the contact group on Namibia have now achieved progress towards the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) after consultations with the parties. The statement issued last week by the contact group promises the long-awaited breakthrough, and we sincerely hope the group will be able to lead the way to the independence of Namibia in 1982.\n221.\tIn South Africa itself, the Pretoria regime persists in its policy of apartheid in total disregard of the insistent demands of the international community. It has in fact stepped up its policy of bantustanization. It is dismaying that the trends in South Africa promise only accelerating violence and further conflict. That situation poses a danger to peace and stability in the region. In line with our traditional stand against all forms of oppression and discrimination, we shall continue to advocate the adoption of further effective sanctions against the racist minority regime in South Africa.\n222.\tTurkey has also condemned the South African aggression against Angola. It is a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country, involving loss of life, human suffering and material damage.\n223.\tKampuchea is another international issue which continues to elude a settlement. The Kampuchean question requires a comprehensive political solution that would enable its people to choose their Government without coercion or intervention from outside.\n224.\tThe International Conference on Kampuchea held last July has provided a new impetus. Turkey regards the Declaration of that Conference  as a practical and sound basis for a settlement.\n225.\tI should like to express our appreciation for the efforts of the humanitarian agencies which are doing their utmost to help the Kampuchean people and the refugees. Their admirable work has helped to alleviate much of the suffering. Improvement in the humanitarian conditions can help in tackling the political problems.\n226.\tWe are all aware of the immense challenge the world is facing in the economic field. Its dimensions are not only economic but human, .social and political as well. When we speak of a more just world economic order we do so in the firm knowledge that if we fail to achieve it in a reasonable span of time, the ensuing tension and confrontations will fatally undermine the prospects of international peace? and cooperation.\n227.\tThe longterm problems with which we have to deal are at present clouded by changes which affect expectations in growth patterns and energy. The economic fabric of the world is undermined by continued high inflation, high interest rates, restrictive financial policies, recession, unemployment^ currency fluctuations and increased protectionism.\n228.\tThe negative effects of these unfavorable trends in the world economy are no doubt felt acutely in the developing countries. Trade between developing and developed countries this most dynamic and positive feature of the world economy during the last decade has been severely limited. In this context we note with growing concern that import restrictions, as well as such policies as subsidies, export credits and other protectionist mechanisms, have become increasingly widespread. In our view the developed countries should try to resolve their sectoral problems through restructuring rather than protectionist measures. It is in this way that all countries could be fully integrated into a multilateral trade system.\n229.\tAnother weakness in the economies of the developing countries is the increase in their foreign debt burden caused by their growing balance of payments deficits, high interest rates and interest rate fluctuations. The problem could be alleviated by recycling the surplus of oil exporting countries and by strengthening the compensatory mechanism of the existing financial institutions. We commend the step already taken in this direction by some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC], in particular Saudi Arabia.\n230.\tThe world economy is moving inevitably towards interdependence. This constitutes an opportunity for common progress towards more fairly shared prosperity. In order to ensure worldwide economic security, international cooperation should be strengthened in a global context in which the mutual interests and responsibilities of the developed and developing countries could better \\\"be defined, harmonized and promoted. We believe, therefore, that we should provide a new momentum to the NorthSouth dialog, which is now stalled. We hope that the NorthSouth meeting in Cancun will pave the way for a new determination to tackle all of the vital problems of the world economy, reaffirm the need for cooperation on a global scale, and lead to the beginning of global negotiations.\n231.\tIn this context, we should like to commend the invaluable efforts of the President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. von Wechmar.\n232.\tWe are pleased to see that progress has been made, particularly in two major areas relating to development issues.\n233.\tThe conclusion of the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi last month, should have a significant bearing on the search for global solutions to energy problems that affect the developed and developing countries alike. We welcome the program of Action adopted at the Conference, However, it is not enough that a Program of Action has been successfully produced at that Conference. A reasonable way of financing it should ensue if we want the program to get off the ground.\n234.\tWe also welcome the successful conclusion of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Paris, and we earnestly hope that it will be followed by positive and concrete results which will help the least-developed countries to overcome their fundamental problems. We welcome the program of Action adopted at that Conference within the framework of which a target of 0.15 per cent of gross national product has been envisaged as aid for the least developed countries. Although we do not think that this figure is a satisfactory one, we strongly hope that this is a minimum target, that it will receive universal acceptance and that the commitments made at the Conference by the donor countries will soon be transformed into reality.\n235.\tThe increasing vulnerability of the world economy calls for substantial and structural solutions. To restrict the issues to food, energy and macroeconomic balances will not be sufficient. The world economy requires wide ranging global structural measures rather than remedies of a partial and sectoral nature.\n236.\tOn the other hand, several developing countries are suffering economic bottlenecks while seeking urgent solutions to their problems. The agenda of the global negotiations should, therefore, encompass all the aspects of the process of a new world economic order. The breakthrough can come only when the economic growth of the developing countries is considered as an essential element in the sustained development of the rich nations and their interests are regarded as complementary and compatible, not conflicting and irreconcilable.\n237.\tAs a developing country Turkey has dealt with development issues ever since its foundation in 1923 and has accumulated valuable experience in this area. It is for this very reason that Turkey feels great sympathy for the developing countries and supports them fully in their fight to eradicate poverty.\n238.\tIn the same spirit, over the years TUrkey has wholeheartedly given its support to many of the initiatives taken within UNCTAD and has contributed to the realization of many of them, such as the Generalized System of Preferences, the Integrated program for Commodities, and the Common Fund.\n239.\tAnother field to which Turkey attaches great importance is economic cooperation among developing countries. Against the background of bleak world economic conditions, there is no doubt that progress reached in this area would contribute immensely to the solution of many of the problems confronting these countries.\n240.\tTurkey has been quite active in this field, both within the framework of UNCTAD, in particular within the framework of the Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, and of GATT, and believes that the Organization of the Islamic Conference is one of the appropriate forums where such cooperation can be meaningfully pursued.\n241.\tWe are resolved to participate in and contribute to the greatest extent possible to such endeavors among the developing countries.\n242.\tAs the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly gets under way, we in Turkey are celebrating the centennial of the founder of our Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatiirk. We would like to recall one of his principal dictums in the field of international relations: \\\"Peace at home, peace abroad\\\". History has time and again shown how perceptive Ataturk's observation was, pointing as it does to the interaction of domestic and foreign affairs. Turkey, in observance of this principle and ideal, will continue to promote peace whether at home or abroad.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n144.\tMr. President, first of all, allow me to extend to you our warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is indeed a matter of deep gratification for my delegation that this honor has been accorded to an Asian country, a founding member of the nonaligned movement with whom my country entertains cordial friendship and fruitful cooperation. We are convinced that with your rich experience at the United Nations and with your personal qualities of a seasoned diplomat you will guide the work of the Assembly to successful results.\n145.\tIt is also a great pleasure for me to welcome the delegations of the Republic of Vanuatu and of Belize, whose countries have just been admitted to the United Nations. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam would like to express its desire to have relations of friendship and cooperation with these two new Members of the Organization.\n146.\tThis session of the General Assembly is being held at a particularly critical moment, when the gains achieved in international peace and detente and the independence and security of nations are being seriously challenged.\n147.\tSince the end of the 1970s, warmongering circles in the United States have escalated the arms race, revived the cold war and sabotaged the process of international detente. At present, this adventurous policy is being stepped up to an alarming extent, causing legitimate concern throughout the world: seeking military superiority, refusing to ratify SALT II, delaying negotiations on disarmament, increasing the military budgets to a record level, deploying medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe, greatly increasing the so-called rapid deployment forces, increasing military aid to Israel, the South African racists and other dictatorial regimes, escalating acts of interference and subversion against national liberation movements and independent countries and, most recently, the decision to manufacture the neutron bomb, notwithstanding the opposition of public opinion, including public opinion in the United States itself.\n148.\tIn order to deceive public opinion, the Reagan Administration uses the pretext of \\\"the struggle against international terrorism\\\" to unleash a noisy campaign of slander against the socialist countries, the nonaligned countries and the national liberation movements. This is the well-known trick of the arsonist calling \\\"Fire\\\", aimed at discrediting the just struggles of peoples for their independence and the support of the socialist countries for national liberation movements. It is an attempt to exonerate the United States from blame for its acts of terrorism, such as wars of aggression, armed interventions, indiscriminate massacres of civilian populations, acts of subversion and coups d'etat, the assassination of leaders of sovereign countries and deliberate acts of military provocation, etc. terrorism the more criminal because it is perpetrated against peoples, against their right to self determination, independence and international security.\n149.\tThe slanderous allegation of the use of chemical weapons in Kampuchea, Laos and Afghanistan is a pure propaganda maneuver by the United States to camouflage its frenetic arms race, especially nuclear arms, its decision to manufacture the neutron bomb, its criminal use of bacteriological weapons against the population, crops and livestock of Cuba, and finally the chemical warfare formerly waged by the United States in South Viet Nam, the serious consequences of which still affect several generations of the civilian population of Viet Nam, as well as hundreds of thousands of American veterans and veterans of its allies in the war in Indo-China.\n150.\tThe militarist policies of the United States Government are becoming ever more dangerous with the closer collusion between imperialism and hegemonism, the most recent manifestation of which was the decision to sell sophisticated weapons to China, a decision which has given rise to legitimate concern in the countries of Asia, in particular those of SouthEast Asia. It is obvious that military cooperation and the strategic coordination of these two biggest forces of aggression create a direct threat to the peace and security of the peoples, first and foremost those in Asia. The war of attrition on all fronts against the three countries of Indo-China, the undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the increased arms deliveries to Pakistan and Thailand, the military provocations and the acts of subversion and destabilization against the legal Governments of the countries of SouthEast Asia are living proof of that SinoAmerican strategy.\n151.\tContrary to the fine sounding rhetoric of the American Secretary of State at the rostrum of the Assembly about the supposed American development strategy, the United States has practiced a policy of obstruction in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, blocked the global economic negotiations and rejected the legitimate demands of the developing countries for a just and equitable new international economic order, thus exacerbating the already very serious economic difficulties of those countries. The international community must firmly condemn the attempt by the United States to use the aid of international organizations within and outside the United Nations system as a political weapon to exert pressure on the developing countries, which is contrary to the purposes and principles of those organizations.\n152.\tFollowing a policy that is diametrically opposed, the socialist countries persevere in the pursuit of peace, detente and international security, the settling of international differences by negotiation, and of peaceful coexistence.\n153.\tThe Vietnamese people highly values the peace program for this decade put forward by President Leonid Brezhnev at the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.2 They support the important peace initiatives put forward by the Soviet Union just before and during this session of the General Assembly, including the draft declaration on the prevention of a nuclear catastrophe.6 These initiatives are imbued with a spirit of responsibility with regard to the destiny of all peoples and are eloquent manifestations of the policy of peace which is a matter of principle for the Soviet Union. They will contribute to improving; the international climate and consolidating world peace and security.\n154.\tLikewise, we welcome the tireless efforts made by the socialist countries, the nonaligned movement and peace-loving forces to reduce tension, achieve disarmament and promote peaceful coexistence. In particular, we support the initiative of the Mongolian People's Republic on the signing of a convention on nonaggression and non-recourse to the use of force in relations among countries in Asia and the Pacific [A!36!388],\n155.\tWhile persevering in their policies of peace and peaceful coexistence, the socialist countries are just as determined to defend their revolutionary gains and strongly support the struggle of peoples to win and defend their independence and freedom and to build a new life in the way that each has freely chosen.\n156.\tThe people of Viet Nam reaffirms its staunch solidarity with and fraternal support for the Polish people in their struggle against internal reactionary forces and imperialist interference and for the defense of socialism in Poland. We are convinced that the Polish people, with the support of the Soviet Union and the socialist community, will emerge victorious from this difficult and complex struggle.\n157.\tDefying all the hostile maneuvers of the Washington Government, the Republic of Cuba continues to gain strength in every way and to go forward with dignity and confidence. Its achievements, at the cost of heroic efforts, are an example to all peoples struggling for the ideals of peace, independence, freedom and socialism. Firmly siding with the brother Cuban people, the Vietnamese people demands that the United States keep its hands off Cuba, put an end to the economic blockade, sabotage, blackmail and threats against that brother country and restore to Cuba the Guantanamo base, which has been illegally occupied.\n158.\tIn Asia the Vietnamese people fully supports the just struggle of the Afghan people to safeguard its independence and sovereignty and the gains of the April revolution. We strongly condemn the undeclared war of the imperialists, the hegemonists and other reactionaries, whose aim is to interfere in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The recent proposals of the Government of Afghanistan, contained in the declaration of 24 August 1981 [A/36/457], are realistic and constructive and could provide a basis for a political solution leading to the normalization of the situation in that region.\n159.\tWith its foreign policy of peace, independence and nonalignment, the Republic of India is making a great contribution to resolving international problems and has become an important factor for peace, development and security in Asia and throughout the world. The decision of the Indian Government to recognize the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the assistance it is giving in the reconstruction of that martyred country are striking illustrations of that wise policy.\n160.\tWe support the endeavors of India, Madagascar and other countries to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. We are in favor of convening as soon as possible the International Conference on the Indian Ocean, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the nonaligned movement. The imperialists must put an end to their military presence and dismantle their existing bases, including that on Diego Garcia.\n161.\tTogether with progressive forces of mankind, the Vietnamese people vehemently condemns the bloody escalation of the Israeli Zionists since the Camp David deals against the people of Palestine and the peoples of other Arab countries, in particular the indiscriminate shelling of the civilian population in Lebanon and the bombing of the peaceful nuclear research center in Iraq. A just and equitable solution to the situation in that region cannot be found without the participation of the PLO, the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people, and must be based on the total elimination of the consequences of Israel's aggression and the full exercise of the fundamental national rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to establish its own independent, sovereign State.\n162.\tCherishing the cause of peace and the solidarity peoples confronting imperialism, Viet Nam expresses the wish that the armed conflict between Iraq and Iran can be resolved speedily through negotiation.\n163.\tWe express our solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its just struggle for the peaceful reunification of Korea without foreign interference.\n164.\tIn Africa, the world is now witnessing the seething and victorious struggle of the peoples of that continent to eliminate the last bastions of colonialism, racism and apartheid supported by imperialism. The Vietnamese people staunchly supports the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO and that of the South African people under the leadership of the African National Congress, using all means at their disposal to exercise their right to self-determination and true independence. Accordingly, we fully support the recent resolutions of the OAU and the one adopted at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, on the question of Namibia.\n165.\tThe Vietnamese people gives it fraternal support to the struggle of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and other front-line countries in defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their respective countries and vehemently condemns the South African racists and the UNITA7 traitors, maintained by the imperialists and international reaction, which are opposing the People's Republic of Angola.\n166.\tThe Vietnamese people values highly the firm positions expressed in the tripartite treaty between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and Ethiopia to safeguard the sovereignty of each country and the security of the region. It reaffirms its total support for the just struggle of the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front, for its right to self-determination and independence. Likewise, it supports the struggle of the people of Cyprus to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of their country.\n167.\tThe Latin American continent is now the theater of a vast movement of opposition to the policy of intervention and destabilization by the United States. We resolutely support the people and Government of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua and the people and Government of Grenada in their work of building and national defense. Our support is likewise accorded to the struggle of the people and Government of Panama to ensure the full sovereignty of Panama over the Canal Zone. Likewise, the valiant struggle of the peoples of Puerto Rico and Chile, and the heroic struggle of the people of El Salvador, led by the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Revolutionary Democratic Front of El Salvador, enjoy the sympathy and active support of our people.\n168.\tThe General Assembly is preparing to celebrate solemnly the twentieth anniversary of the first Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries. During these two decades the nonaligned movement, firmly devoted to its goals of anti-imperialist struggle and strengthening solidarity within the movement and with other forces for peace and progress, has overcome all trials, has continued to develop and has become an important political force in the world, making a worthy contribution to the straggle of peoples for their political independence and economic sovereignty and to international peace and security.\n169.\tThe present situation in SouthEast Asia remains a cause for concern among the international community. Some have tried to create confusion about what has been happening in recent years in that region, but the facts suffice to show up any distortion. Facts are more convincing than any rhetoric; they help us distinguish truth from falsehood, good from bad.\n170.\tPublic opinion is enlightened daily regarding the primary danger that is threatening the independence and security of the SouthEast Asian countries as well as peace and stability in the region. A number of experienced observers agree that, after the fiasco of their actions against Kampuchea, Viet Nam and Laos during 1979 and 1980, the Peking authorities, in collusion with the United States, are now striving to wage a real war of attrition on all fronts against the three countries of Indo-China. There is a concentration of 400,000 troops near the SinoVietnamese border; there is a permanent threat of Viet Nam being invaded a second time; there is a proliferation of provocative activities and armed conflicts along the SinoVietnamese border and the LaosChina border; traitors are being mustered and mercenaries are being recruited to foment disturbances and to undertake subversive activities in their countries of origin; the psychological war is being intensified and there is a press campaign on a world scale against Viet Nam, as well as an economic blockade, etc. Everything is being done to exert pressure on Viet Nam and the other countries of Indo-China, to weaken and subjugate them. In particular, the Peking authorities have increased their food and arms supplies to the Pol Pot remnants and other reactionary Khmers. They are doing all they can to establish the so called united front of various groups of Khmer reactionaries, in order to camouflage the maintenance of the genocidal clique of Pol Pot.\n171.\tWhat should be underscored here is that this policy of Peking, which is hostile to the three countries of Indo-China, is sanctioned and encouraged by Washington. Continuing to play the Chinese card, the warmongers of the United States openly call for maximum pressure on all fronts political, diplomatic, economic and even military -to bleed Viet Nam. Those who want to use force to try to subjugate Viet Nam and other countries in Indo-China should remember the lessons of the very recent past.\n172.\tThe Peking authorities have not yet abandoned their traditional policy of interference in and sowing discord among the countries of SouthEast Asia. On the one hand, Peking is bending over backwards to be nice to the countries of the region; on the other hand, it refuses to halt its support for armed groups of pseudo-revolutionaries in their subversive activities and is causing civil war and internal conflicts in a number of countries. It is not abandoning any of its baseless claims on onshore or offshore territories of most of its neighbors and is continuing its illegal occupation of parts of the territory of those countries, including the Vietnamese archipelago of Hoang Sa (the Paracels). For decades China has been arbitrarily including the greater part of the South China Sea within its territorial waters, thus denying the sovereign rights of the other coastal countries of SouthEast Asia over their\nexclusive economic zones and the continental shelf.\n/\n173.\tWide sectors of public opinion and even the leaders of the countries of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN] are realizing more clearly each day that it is the hegemonist and expansionist policy of China which constitutes the greatest danger to peace and stability in the region.\n174.\tThe events of these last three years have clearly shown that, contrary to the expectations of its enemies, Viet Nam has not collapsed. On the contrary, thanks to its just policy, its own efforts and the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as the support given by numerous friends throughout the world, Viet Nam is busy gradually overcoming the enormous difficulties bequeathed to it by more than 30 years of wars of foreign aggression and successive natural calamities, and we are concentrating all our efforts to rebuild and defend our homeland.\n175.\tThe Lao people, hardworking and creative, united and vigilant, has for its part recorded great achievements in its national reconstruction. It has also caused the failure of various attempts at interference and subversive activities on the part of the Peking expansionists, while staunchly defending its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. In foreign policy, while fostering solidarity with Viet Nam, Kampuchea and the socialist community, the Lao People's Democratic Republic is playing a growing role in the cause of peace, stability and cooperation in Indo-China and in SouthEast Asia. Furthermore, it is sparing no effort to transform the border between Laos and Thailand into a border of peace, friendship and cooperation.\n176.\tWhat arouses worldwide admiration is the rapid renaissance of the Kampuchean people. In less than three years this valiant people, which survived the terrible genocide carried out by the Pol Pot clique, has driven back famine and is now reorganizing its social and family life. The economic, cultural and religious activities of the country are being gradually normalized. The Kampuchean people, master of its destiny, has held truly free and democratic general elections throughout the whole country to elect at all levels its organs of State power sand to adopt its constitution. These great achievements have unequivocally demonstrated that the People's Republic of\nKampuchea is an independent and sovereign State and that the Kampuchean people, having fully exercised its right to self-determination, is now resolutely marching along its freely chosen path.\n177.\tThe Pol Pot clique, which felled millions of Kampucheans with hoes and axes, which some, at this rostrum, still cynically call \\\"patriots\\\", has no place in any part of the territory of Kampuchea. To continue to recognize those butchers as representatives of the Kampuchean people in the United Nations is an insult to the memory of the 3 million victims of Pol Pot's genocide and to the martyr people that is busy reconstructing its country. It is gross interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea and a flagrant violation of the right to self-determination of the Kampuchean people, completely contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Such an attitude only encourages Chinese expansionism, worsens tension in SouthEast Asia and prevents the United Nations from playing its rightful role in trying to resolve the problems of peace and security in the region. Justice and law demand that an end be put to this absurd situation. The Pol Pot clique must be expelled from the Organization and Kampuchea's seat at the United Nations restored to the State Council of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the sole legal authentic representative of the Kampuchean people.\n178.\tThe facts of the last three years prove that if there is a threat to the security of the ASEAN countries and to the peace and stability of the region, it does not come from the countries of Indo-China but from the hegemonis tic and expansionist policies of the Peking authorities. Throughout history, Viet Nam has never invaded the ASEAN countries; on the contrary, Thailand has three times invaded Viet Nam and several times committed acts of aggression against Laos and Kampuchea. A number of member countries of ASEAN, in varying degrees, assisted the United States in its war of aggression against the three countries of Indo-China.\n179.\tThe peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea, through their selfless struggle against external aggression, have contributed to the establishment of a new period favorable to independence, peace and stability in SouthEast Asia. At the present time, the fact that the Kampuchean people toppled the Pol Pot regime, the Lao people is struggling successfully against interference and subversive activities on the part of Peking and the Vietnamese people is advancing with sure steps in the reconstruction and defense of its homeland after having repelled Chinese aggression means they have made an effective contribution in stemming the danger of hegemony and expansion by Peking in this region. Through its foreign policy of peace, independence, friendship and international cooperation, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, together with the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea, constitutes an important positive factor in preserving peace and stability in this strategic region of the world.\n180.\tSome people attempt to ascribe the lack of peace and stability in SouthEast Asia to the so-called expansionism of the Soviet Union or to VietnameseSoviet relations. The facts have proved that over the last four decades, among the five permanent members of the Security Council, the Soviet Union is the only country \nwhich has never waged wars of aggression against any of the countries of SouthHast Asia. On the contrary, it has resolutely sided with the peoples of Indo-China in their patriotic struggle against foreign aggression thus contributing to the consolidation of the independence and security of the three countries of Indo-China and to safeguarding peace and stability in SouthEast Asia. It is also quite clear that VietnameseSoviet relations do not threaten any third country.\n181.\tAt present, in order to restore peace and stability in SouthEast Asia it is necessary to put an end to the policy of intervention, aggression, and threats of war pursued by the Chinese hegemonists in collusion with imperialists and other reactionaries in opposition to the independence, sovereignty and security of the countries of the region. The key to the so-called problem of Kampuchea, if there is one, lies in resolving the contradictions that really exist between China and the three countries of Indo-China, and not the fictitious contradiction between these latter countries and those of ASEAN.\n182.\tIn the past the peoples of the three countries of Indo-China always acted in solidarity and coordinated their struggle for the independence and the freedom of each. History has shown that this solidarity is vital for each of our three peoples, since we have always had to struggle against aggressors which were much stronger than we and which ceaselessly divided us and pitted us against each other in order to weaken us and to annex all three countries.\n183.\tIn the present circumstances, confronted with the serious threat to their national independence and security, the three IndoChinese countries have no alternative but to unite once more and to help one another in the struggle against the aggressor. The right of legitimate individual and collective self-defense of the peoples of the IndoChinese peninsula is one that is expressly recognized for all peoples in the Charter of the United Nations. Regrettably, certain speakers at this rostrum have deliberately sown confusion between the aggressor and the victim of aggression and denied the victim's sacred right to self-defense. Likewise, they have ignored the facts of the recent Chinese war of aggression against Viet Nam and passed in silence over the presence of dozens of divisions of Chinese troops along the SinoVietnamese border, which have daily committed countless crimes against the Vietnamese inhabitants in the border areas, while the Chinese threaten aggression against Viet Nam for a second time.\n184.\tWith regard to the-presence of Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and that of the People's Republic of Kampuchea have repeatedly stated that that presence is only temporary and that it is intended only to counter the threat by China acting in collusion with the imperialists and is not directed against any third country. Once that threat has ceased and on the basis of a common agreement between the two countries, those troops will be withdrawn from Kampuchea. At the present time, if peace and stability are secured along the Thai Kamuchean border, Viet Nam and Kampuchea will agree on a partial withdrawal of those troops. The three IndoChinese countries have, furthermore, proposed the establishment of a demilitarized zone on both sides of the Thai Kampuchean border, with some form of international monitoring to be agreed upon by both sides.\n185.\tThe position of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea on this subject is explicit: any United Nations resolution with regard to Kampuchea will be null and void if the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has not participated in its elaboration and given its agreement and if the United Nations continues to permit the genocidal Pol Pot clique and its fellow plotters to usurp Kampuchea's seat in the Organization. The so-called International Conference on Kampuchea, convened on the basis of a fictitious situation, is merely a political intrigue on the part of its authors in an attempt to intervene in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, an independent and sovereign State. The Ad Hoc Committee produced by that Conference, the legalization of which is now being attempted by means of a General Assembly resolution, is nothing but a subterfuge for the purpose of misusing United Nations machinery to impose upon this sovereign State a so-called comprehensive political solution, one that the people and Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea have firmly rejected.\n186.\tThe behavior of the Chinese delegation at that Conference left no room for doubt in that regard: China is determined at all costs to resolve the matter by military means so as to impose the genocidal Pol Pot clique on the Kampuchean people once again.\n187.\tFor their part, the ASEAN countries, while stating that they are in favor of dialog, in fact show themselves to be accomplices or at least acquiescent in Peking's intrigues. It is clear that this is not the path that will lead to peace and stability in the region but, on the contrary, will lead to tension and crisis and be contrary to the interests of those very countries.\n188.\tThe Vietnamese people is determined to fight, shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of Laos and Kampuchea, to defeat the Peking leaders' policy of intervention and aggression against the three countries of Indo-China. However, we cherish the traditional friendship with the Chinese people and will spare no effort to normalize relations between the two countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence, respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the settlement of disputes through negotiations. It is in this spirit that the Government of Viet Nam has on repeated occasions proposed negotiations with the Chinese Government.\n189.\tRecently on 31 August last showing proof of our perseverance, we made another proposal calling for the resumption in September or October this year of the third round of negotiations between Viet Nam and China, which have been interrupted for more than a year by China, in order to discuss matters of mutual interest and to normalize relations between the two countries. For the time being, our proposals concern urgent measures to restore peace and stability along the border between the two countries, including the cessation of hostilities, the separation of the armed forces of the two countries and the creation of a demilitarized zone. Viet Nam likewise reaffirms its readiness to sign with China a treaty of non aggression and peaceful coexistence. It is regrettable that these proposals were rejected by the People's Republic of China.\nt\n190.\tWith regard to relations between the countries of Indo-China and those of ASEAN, differences exist be \ntween the two groups of countries concerning the assessment of the causes of the state of tension and instability in SouthEast Asia and consequently concerning the ways and means to restore peace and stability in the region. Although at present those differences cannot yet be surmounted, the two groups of countries nevertheless have a good basis for making progress towards a settlement of the problems confronting the region, because both have a fundamental interest in common, that is, peace and stability in SouthEast Asia. In the statements made at the conferences of Foreign Ministers of the three countries, held in Vientiane, Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh, the three countries of Indo-China have repeatedly put forward realistic proposals in that regard. Since the beginning of this year the Foreign Ministers of Laos and Viet Nam have met several times with their counterparts from almost all the ASEAN countries. These meetings have helped to promote the process of regional dialog and consultations and have improved mutual understanding among the countries of SouthEast Asia.\n191.\tThe countries of Indo-China have never intended to impose their views on the countries of ASEAN. Likewise, the ASEAN countries should not harbor the illusion that they can impose their views on the countries of Indo-China. To be realistic we should set aside our differences and embark on a dialog on a basis of equality, on the principle that the affairs of SouthEast Asia 'must be resolved by the SouthEast Asian countries themselves, without the imposition of one side's views on the other and without any external interference. That is the correct road leading to peace and stability in the region and to the achievement of peaceful coexistence between the two groups of countries, in the interest of the peoples of SouthEast Asia and world peace and in full conformity with the United Nations Charter and the principles of the nonaligned movement. The Declaration of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of NonAligned Countries [see A/36/J16 and Corn 1, annex], held at New Delhi in February 1981 did not endorse the idea of convening an international conference on Kampuchea but called on all the States of the region to engage in a dialog that might lead to a settlement of their differences and to the establishment of lasting peace and stability in the region and to the elimination of interference and the threat of intervention by outside Powers. < \u2022\n192.\tApplication of the principle that the affairs of a region must be settled by the States of that region through negotiations on the basis of respect for the independence and sovereignty of each country without foreign interference has become common practice in many regions of the world, in Europe, Africa and Latin America.\n193.\tMy delegation wishes to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the principles governing relations of peaceful coexistence between the two groups of countries of Indo-China and ASEAN for the purpose of building a SouthEast Asia of peace, stability, friendship and cooperation, principles enunciated at this session of the General Assembly by Mr. Sipraseut, VicePrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [see 16th meeting], with the consent of the Governments of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. These principles are in accordance with the present reality of SouthEast Asia and fully meet the interests and profound aspirations of all the peoples of the region and the wishes of all those who cherish peace and stability in SouthEast Asia wishes that have been expressed by many representatives in this very Assembly.\n194.\tMy delegation would like to believe that these principles will also constitute a useful contribution to the debate of the Assembly when it takes up agenda item 34, entitled \\\"Question of peace, stability and cooperation in SouthEast Asia\\\".\n195.\tIn conclusion, we are now facing great historic responsibilities with respect to the peace and security of peoples. We are living at a time when peoples are fully aware of their own abilities and are taking the making of history into their own hands. With the continued development of the forces of socialism, national independence, democracy and peace, our peoples are capable of preserving detente, maintaining peace, consolidating national independence, achieving peaceful coexistence and building a better life according to their own nature and characteristics. The people and Government of Viet Nam are ready to bend every effort to make their modest contribution to this noble common cause.\n"

        "file_text": "Faith in the United Nations and in the principles and ideals it personifies, the search for dialog and cooperation, and constant concern for peaceful settlement of disputes among nations rather than confrontation. These are the reasons why we are gathered here to consider ways of promoting a more just, more equitable and more humane world.\n2.\tFrom the very inception cf the Organization, various problems have revealed to us the difficult path that lies ahead and the efforts needed to arrive at a world viable for all. The solutions proposed since then for strengthening the activities of our Organization and adapting them to those objectives have only partially fulfilled our hopes.\n3.\tThe fact that a number of organs of the United Nations system have taken economic imperatives into account provides useful support for the political function of the Organization in view of the complicated way in which political organs seek to achieve international harmony. The continuing task of adapting our institution to its objectives is performed under the impulse of devoted and competent individuals such as you, Mr. President.\n4.\tThe fact that our deliberations are taking place under the presidency of a man whose probity and vast political experience we have had the privilege of appreciating for a number of years reassures us and gives us confidence in the success of our endeavors.. We are particularly confident that your mastery of the questions before us and your deep commitment to find solutions will imbue these deliberations with the dynamism and forcefulness that their seriousness requires.\n5.\tAllow me also to pay a heartfelt tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, for the remarkable work he accomplished during his term of office. During that time he showed himself to be fully deserving of the confidence placed in him by the international community.\n6.\tFinally, we wish to thank the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts throughout the past year in helping the international community to attain its objectives. The dedication and willingness to act that he has demonstrated should be particularly emphasized.\n7.\tThe international community has just admitted two new Members, Belize' and Vanuatu, two peoples rich in history and remarkable for their tenacity and their culture. We congratulate them on their accession to independence and their admission to the United Nations. We are convinced that they will bring a breath of fresh air which will be beneficial to the Organization.\n8.\tThe building of a viable world for mankind is the task of the international community and the responsibility of each of its members. Our philosophy in Burundi is that by strengthening peace and justice within our borders we shall be contributing effectively to the harmonious development of mankind.\n9.\tThe present international situation presents a very grim picture. Basically it is characterized by a worsening of the international political climate, a deterioration in most of our economies which are suffering from the burden of colossal indebtedness, a revival of the arms race, a hardening of the bloc policy and therefore a progressive breakdown of detente. The maintenance of dependence, exploitation, the denial of rights and of justice still characterizing colonial domination and apartheid in South Africa, plundering by the powerful of the resources of the poor, the easy temptation for some to impose their political models on others by force all these factors together lead my delegation to wonder about the future of our community.\n10.\tTherefore it is essential that the General Assembly, at its thirty-sixth session, carefully examine the ills our community is suffering and administer the necessary remedies.\n11.\tThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization during the past year {AI36/1] describes the problems confronting the world, places them in their proper context and outlines possible solutions. While no continent seems to have been spared the effects of the present economic crisis or political upheavals of various lands, Africa still remains the most afflicted continent and will be so until it has rid itself of the infectious germs of apartheid in its southern region and put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa.\nA/36/PV.19\n12.\tThe General Assembly, at its thirty-sixth session, will hear once again, through the debates on apartheid and on the question of Namibia, about the ignominious Pretoria regime. In spite of the numerous appeals by the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the nonaligned movement calling on Pretoria to put an end to apartheid, South Africa, in defiance of the universal consensus, is refining still further its\nsystem of racial oppression, maintaining the region in a constant state of tension and conducting acts of armed aggression against neighboring countries, in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the basic tenets of international law governing the behavior of States.\n13.\tSouth Africa's continued refusal to comply with the decisions of our Assembly becomes understandable only if analyzed from the standpoint of the multifaceted support it receives from its allies. These latter, speculating on their strategic interests and the benefits that they derive from maintaining the reign of apartheid, not only endeavor to break the political isolation in which the rejection of apartheid by the international community has confined Pretoria, but also contrive, to the detriment of all the rest of humanity, to strengthen their close collaboration in the military and financial fields.\nA\n14.\tInstead of beginning constructive dialog with the black population, which it oppresses today, and recognizing its universally acknowledged rights, Pretoria believes it can prolong its reign by oppression, Bantustanization, the exile of leaders and the assassination of the freedom fighters in southern Africa.\n15.\tThe thirst of a people for freedom is irrepressible, irreversible and unassailable. Pretoria and its allies would be showing a fatal lack of perception if they believed for a single moment that the policy of apartheid could be viable in the long term. The temporary military superiority of South Africa, the formidable oppression of which the black population is the victim, the punitive raids constantly launched against Angola, do not in any way change the above-mentioned principle. Rather, they increase the fighting spirit of the liberation movements concerned, strengthen their tenacity and reaffirm their faith in victory.\n16.\tThrough their obstinacy, their blind refusal to enter into dialog and their inability to draw from the lessons of history, even recent ones\\\" such as that of the decolonization of Zimbabwe, the Pretoria authorities are forging the weapons of their own destruction . We reiterate today our firm and constant support 'or the liberation movements in southern Africa.\n17.\tThe end of the present year should have been crowned by the entry of Namibia into the United Nations family as a free and independent nation. South Africa, however, has ruined by its inconstancy and arrogance the hopes that had been aroused by the efforts of the international community to see Namibia accede peacefully to independence.\n18.\tThe time has now come, following the failure of the pre-implementation meeting held at Geneva in January 1981 on Namibia and the paralysis and inability of the Security Council to impose mandatory sanctions against South Africa in keeping with Chapter VII of the Charter, to ask ourselves what strategy must be followed to put an end to the impasse in the process of decolonizing Namibia.\n19.\tThe eighth emergency special session, on Namibia, which closed on the eve of the thirty-sixth session, depicted clearly enough the dramas which afflict the Namibian people and stressed the explosive nature of the situation in which South Africa, by its illegal occupation of Namibia, maintains the southern part of our continent. We participated actively in that debate. Therefore, we shall today confine ourselves to stating the position of our delegation concerning the Namibian question.\n20.\tFirst of all, we reiterate our support for the South West Africa People's Organization [5VWO], the sole representative of the Namibian people. The Namibian question is, in the last analysis, a question of decolonization under the full and sole responsibility of the United Nations. We therefore reject any attempt to distort its nature or deflect its course.\n21.\tWe believe that no country or group of countries has any right to link the independence of Namibia to events or situations that take place or might take place outside its borders.\n22.\tThe decolonization plan for Namibia, as approved by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978), must be fully implemented. We see.no reason to dilute its substance or delay its implementation.\n23.\tDecree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia, enacted by the United Nations Council for Namibia on 27 September 1974,' must be strictly respected. Those who indulge directly or indirectly in the exploitation of Namibian resources, regardless of their origin, must immediately put an end to that outrageous pillage.\n24.\tWe ask the five Western countries, members of the contact group, no longer to tolerate Pretoria's sabotaging the decolonization plan for Namibia, which is provided for in resolution 435 (1978) and of which they claim to be the authors.\n25.\tThe right to self-determination has become the cardinal principle of contemporary international law. Without it, the Organization would once again be reduced to a closed club of nations. Without it, the United Nations would never have acquired the dimensions conferred upon it by its present universality. This is why the United Nations has never ceased to defend staunchly and consistently the right to self-determination and independence.\n26.\tFor more than a decade, the United Nations has supported with rare firmness the right of the Sahraoui people to independence. No fait accompli has been able to alter that truth, or erode the convictions of the international community on this point.\n27.\tFor our part, we remain convinced that the question of Western Sahara is simply a question of decolonization, although some, for reasons of their own which are hardly convincing, attempt to distort the situation through a series of arguments to which they alone lend an ear.\n28.\tThe United Nations and the OAU have, over the years, determined in a clear and consistent manner the framework and procedures for the decolonization of Western Sahara. It is now a matter of leaving it to the inhabitants of that Territory to decide for themselves what their future is to be, freely and directly, without threats or intimidation.\n29.\tTo refuse, by means of subterfuge and delaying tactics, which are all equally suspect, to establish the necessary conditions for a free and genuine consultation of the inhabitants of Western Sahara indicates in the last analysis fear of the verdict of that people.\n30.\tIt is possible to close the dossier on Western Sahara only by leaving it to the Sahraoui people to decide its own future. We invite the parties directly concerned, that is the POLISARIO Front and Morocco, to engage in sincere, direct negotiations in order to arrive at a final settlement of the question of Western Sahara. Any other effort aimed at regionalizing the conflict that exists between the parties could only lead to useless bloodshed of innocent people and the wasting of resources which could have been used for other purposes.\n31.\tThe escalation of the violence ravaging the Middle East stems from Israel's denial of the universally recognized right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Only the full exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self determination, including its right to establish its own State, can today put an end to the tragedy affecting the peoples of the region. Any attempt which does not take into account these premises and which would deny to the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] exclusive representation of the Palestinian people can in Our view only prolong the bloody status quo in the region.\n32.\tIsrael cannot guarantee its own security by violence or by the aggression that it commits against neighboring countries.\n33.\tWe have in the past condemned the establishment of settlements by the Israeli Government in occupied Palestinian territories. The persistence of that Israeli policy forces us today to reiterate our disapproval. We cannot agree to the Palestinian people being reduced to the state of refugees. We therefore refuse to endorse the annexation by Israel of the eastern part of the city of Jerusalem.\n34.\tWeak States owe their survival to strict respect by the most powerful States of the norms governing international relations. The founding fathers of this Organization were so aware of this that they made respect for the principle of non use of force, in international relations an essential rule governing the behavior of all States.\n35.\tIt is, then, out of faithfulness to that principle that we reject any excuse that might be devised for invading the territories of others. It is up to each country, regardless of size and economic potential, to choose, in the exercise of full sovereignty, free of all foreign interference, the lines of its policy based on the priorities it has chosen. This principle, in our view, is of universal application.\n36.\tThe conflicts that we have witnessed in certain parts of the world derive from failure to respect the aforementioned principle. We cannot put an end to such conflicts except through political solutions, leaving it to the countries concerned to determine the type of government that responds to the aspirations of their peoples.\n37.\tTherefore, we cannot in any circumstances support the invasion of any country by foreign troops. Whether it be in Afghanistan or Kampuchea, the peoples must be allowed freely to choose their own leaders.\n38.\tWith respect to Korea, Burundi deplores the fact that a people sharing one culture is artificially divided and that its efforts to achieve reunification are.hampered by all types of interference. The Republic of Burundi has always supported and will continue to support without reservation, any proposal leading to the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean homeland. To that end, we call For the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea.\n39.\tThe international political situation is in a state of crisis and the economic horizon has darkened. Deficits in balance of payments, the food crisis in the developing countries, the energy crisis, incoherence in the conduct of economic policies, the revival of protectionism, the fall in commodity prices, the reduction in official development assistance, delays in negotiations on the transfer of technology, an impasse in the global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development, plans to assist the most seriously affected countries still at the stage of pious wishes that is the present picture of the overall economic situation of the developing countries.\n40.\tThat grim picture is compounded by the specific difficulties of the least advanced countries, the most seriously affected, among which, unfortunately, is my country. For a long time now, in order to stimulate our economy, we have made a wise choice of development priorities by joining regional economic associations and by relying on international assistance, both bilateral and multilateral.\n41.\tAt the national level, we are naturally aware that the responsibility to finance our development is first and foremost our own. We also know that we are duty bound fully to mobilize all the human and financial resources that we possess. Foreign resources, especially official development aid, are only a supplement to that. Our development priorities have been clearly set. Agricultural and rural development is among the primary objectives of our Government. Most of our population is concentrated in the rural areas and that is where we focus most of our efforts.\n42.\tNone the less, our economy remains dependent on fluctuations in the prices of agricultural products. The galloping cost of energy, the lack of territorial access to the sea, the high cost of transit and transportation, all impose limitations on us which seriously handicap our economic and social development projects. We therefore regret that the Transport and Communications Decade in Africa proclaimed by the General Assembly {resolution 32/160] has not been given the attention it deserves.\n43.\tAt the regional level, our membership in regional associations is due to our desire to utilize to the maximum cooperation agreements among developing countries and the need to establish institutions that can help Member States collectively to develop the means and the infrastructures necessary to guarantee economic and social development, institutions which could not be established individually. The establishment of projects by the countries of our subregion will certainly make it possible for us to strengthen our economic potential and speed up our economic growth. In this connection, we request thee support and aid of the international community so that we can properly carry out our development programFs.\n44.\tThe present economic situation of the least developed countries is worsening because of a series of factors totally beyond their control. These have recently attracted the attention of the United Nations. That is why the fifth session of UNCTAD adopted the Comprehensive New program of Action for the Least Developed Countries.3\n45.\tThe International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [General Assembly resolution 35/56, annex), in turn, gave priority to the establishment of a substantial program of sufficient magnitude to make it possible for those countries to put an end to their present stagnation. It was intended that all those action programs would be established by the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Paris in September 1981.\n46.\t*We are particularly grateful to certain countries, including those of the European Community, for their efforts to lessen the difficulties faced by that category of countries. None the less, we hoped that the spirit of generosity that inspired the action programs would be translated into concrete form. The assistance that we have received in this connection remains far below the level of our needs. Therefore, we appeal once again to the developed donor countries and those developing countries able to do so to honor the commitments that they have made with respect to the least developed countries.\n47.\tThe ever-increasing economic interdependence makes it necessary to adopt positive and constructive policies if we are to guarantee economic stability and establish sound international relations.\n48.\tIt is from that standpoint that we envisage the beginning of global negotiations. The profound changes in the world economy in recent years mean that the status quo in present international economic relations must be changed. In our view, it is in the interest of the entire international community to revive the global negotiations. Their continued obstruction would cause frustrations the consequences of which are at present unforeseeable. As Luis Echeverria said, \\\"There can be no community of free individuals based indefinitely on exploitation, poverty and the ignorance of the masses. History, both teacher and mother, has revealed this in blood, pain and tears\\\". It is still within our power to prevent the fulfillment of this prophecy.\n49.\tThe fact that so many high-level officials have gathered here has made it possible for us to take the pulse of the international political and economic situation. We have seen our weaknesses and our potential. We believe that solutions to the different problems revealed in the course of this debate can be found if there is a minimum of political will.\n50.\tOne of the merits of the United Nations is precisely the fact that the diversity of its Members constitutes its wealth. Like any other human endeavor, the United Nations has its weaknesses and its limitations. None the less, we remain convinced that it is still the best instrument to guarantee international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "My first words are addressed to the delegation of Vanuatu on the occasion of the admission of that country to membership in the Organization. France is tied with the people of Vanuatu in many ways and we therefore welcome this one hundred and fifty-fifth Member of the United Nations into our midst.\n2.\tThe Assembly's decision to entrust to you, Sir, the presidency of the thirty-sixth session is one that we find fully justified, and I should like to express to you my delegation's warmest congratulations. You are well aware of the ties that bind our two countries. Your personality and experience in international affairs guarantee that our work will be conducted with all necessary vigor and authority.\n3.\tMy next remarks are addressed to you, Mr. Secretary General. All of us here are familiar with your political acumen and your commitment to international order. We have had many occasions to meet and to become acquainted over the years. To my Government's tribute to your qualities I should like to add my own personal expression of friendship and high esteem.\n4.\tWe also know that we can count on the competence and active participation of the Secretariat. We can be sure of its invaluable support, however onerous the tasks imposed by the successful operation of a session such as this. I wish to express my congratulations and thanks to them for this.\n5.\tA radical political change recently occurred in the political life of my country, France. On 10 May, a new President of the Republic was elected. On 21 June, by sweeping a majority of the left into power in a most spectacular way, the people of France reaffirmed their will to turn over a new leaf and to enter a new era. The world of today and of tomorrow is not and cannot be build in the image of the world of yesterday.\n6.\tFor many years now, a majority of the States of the world have been heralding in this very forum the new international economic order. This order will not be solely economic nor will it be exclusively international. My country is aware of this change and the Socialist Government of France has embarked upon a definition of this new order, an order which will be more just and more equitable for the least privileged, the weak, those who languish on the periphery of society, those who for too long have been ignored. These people form the most important element of our majority in France; they also form the majority here in this hall. To all of them we wish to propose a future, an ideal consisting of progress and hope.\n7.\tThe message of which my Government feels itself to be the bearer therefore transcends our own frontiers. Of course there is no question of proposing to others solutions that must be defined and adopted only by each people according to its own constitutional authority. The right of each people to define its own destiny is sacred. But there are principles and aspirations that our national community intends to assert and ^defend, and which we . believe have universal value, since they will form the international order.\n8.\tAfter those preliminary remarks, it goes almost without saying that our conduct in its entirety is devoted to man himself. Man is the fundamental value. Man is the starting point and the ultimate objective of all policies. France denounces all forms of totalitarianism and authoritarianism. We denounce and will fight discrimination in all its forms, whether religious, sexist or racist. France declares war on contempt.\n9.\tOur common fight in this Organization therefore must be waged resolutely to ensure respect and freedom for men. It is inconceivable that a State should base its strength and prosperity on the oppression of its citizens, or, worse still, on the humiliation and rejection of a part of its population who are denied the status of citizenship.\n10.\tSome will object that the Charter of the United Nations, like the rules of international law, prohibits interference in affairs falling within the national jurisdiction of a State. But in this context I should like to make two comments.\n11.\tThe first which hardly needs to be made in this Assembly is that the very practices of our Organization testify to a significant evolution in this regard. Little by little, massive and flagrant violations of fundamental human rights appear to be falling within the competence of the international community, as one can judge from conventions and other international agreements adopted in recent years at world and regional levels.\n12.\tWho today still doubts that apartheid and other manifestations of racism can and should be denounced be fore the principal United Nations bodies? Who has not welcomed the progress inadequate as it may be brought about thanks to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, held at Helsinki? With regard to violations less broad in scope, they are, as representatives are aware, the object, particularly within the Commission on Human Rights whose tenacity we admire of procedures which are often discreet but which gradually are permitting certain practices to be corrected.\n13.\tI would add that in the field of human rights the actions of international institutions truly complement those of nongovernmental organizations. I should like to pay a tribute 19*, them today, as well as to the associations, labor unions, political parties, youth movements, religious groups and, of course, to the mass media, the audiovisual medium in particular, which have helped so much to arouse public opinion and mobilize it in express sing its indignation when shocking situations have arisen that need to be condemned.\n14.\tHuman rights are inseparable from the rights of peoples and nations. I have already emphasized the right of each people to decide its own destiny, in total independence, and therefore to choose its political regime, its economic system, its social structures and its friendships; freedom to enter into a network of alliances or to prefer neutrality or nonalignment. France has always been and remains conscious and jealous of its independence. Its geographical situation, its cultural affinities and the fact that the world is, unfortunately, a dangerous place have prompted France to adhere freely to the Atlantic Alliance, to which it brings a loyal contribution in the defense of values that are common to all members of the Alliance  the values of freedom and civilization.\n15.\tHowever, France reserves the right to make its sovereign judgment of the threats and dangers that could lead to the gravest decisions. It hopes, too, that negotiations between the greatest Powers will make it possible to reduce the growing threats resulting from recent over-armament. Further, it reaffirms its determination to contribute to establishing confidence building measures from the Urals to the Atlantic. The relations that it has maintained for many years with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of Eastern Europe allow it to express itself clearly, to let its convictions and worries be known directly, without going through intermediaries, and to contribute in this way to establishing between the countries of Western and Eastern Europe relations promoting the fullest development of all peoples.\n16.\tThe right which we claim to determine our own future is something which we believe it is only fair that other States, both small and large, weak and strong, peoples of the South and of the North, should be allowed to possess, too. France will therefore be on the side of those who fight for the recognition of the rights of their people or for the independence of their nation.\n17.\tWe have the greatest sympathy for those who, still remaining outside the mainstream of East-West confrontation, wish to escape from spheres of influence. We salute the nonaligned movement and wilt be happy to lend our support to genuine efforts at nonalignment, whenever that nonalignment is proposed fry an authentic member of that movement. The world is not inexorably condemned to be divided into two enemy camps. The tensions which sometimes exist between neighbors must not be artificially transformed into duels between champions of the East and West. The sole object of a recent Franco-Mexican statement on El Salvador was to serve as a reminder of the need to let each people settle its own affairs by political and democratic processes.\n18.\tFaithful to its principles, France condemns outside interference and therefore denounces all undertakings .of force against any people and any State. Violence cannot create right. This elemental truth must not be forgotten, whatever the circumstances, the status or reasons of those who occupy territories against the will of the population that has been invaded and subjugated. Without comparing the occupying Powers, their reasons or their methods, condemnation must be applied equally to the Republic of South Africa, when it sends its tanks into Angola and ignores United Nations resolutions on Namibia; to Viet Nam, when it continues its occupation of Kampuchea; and to the Soviet Union, when it intervenes with its troops in Afghanistan.\n19.\tIn the Middle East, it is not through violence\u2014of which our Ambassador to Lebanon, Mr. Louis Delamare, recently became an innocent victim that peace will finally return to this part of the world, which was the cradle of so many civilizations and which has become the crucible of so much suffering!. The people and cultures of this region, who through the centuries have been caught in the web of historical evolution, victims of contempt and hatred, have a right to peace; their States should be able to develop in security; their peoples should be allowed to build their future in justice.\n20.\tViolation of the resolutions of the Organization is not the way to ensure the necessary security for the countries in the Middle East, for all the countries, including Israel. War is not the way for the peoples of this region, all the peoples, including the Palestinian people, to see all their rights recognized, including the right to a homeland and a State.\n21.\tThere, as elsewhere in the world, negotiation among all the parties concerned is the only acceptable means of dealing with the reasons that have led one or another of them to act by sword and fire. Negotiation is the golden rule of the Organization. If this rule is broken once, just once, how can its observance be required elsewhere and in all cases?\n22.\tLet those here who are tempted to justify violence in one instance reflect on the fact that one day they may themselves be the victims of some other violence and be destroyed by it. Justice for peoples, security for States, respect for international decisions, negotiation: these are the principles that will guide France in the position it takes on the Middle East and throughout the world.\n23.\tHere then are quite a number of situations characterized by attacks on the principles of self determination and national sovereignty. All of us together in this room must agree to maintain the necessary pressure. Let us proclaim our willingness to resort to dialog, to discussion, to objective analysis of the concerns and motivations\nof all parties. We are convinced that such an approach is\nvalid in the case of most of the crises that the world community has to face,\n24.\tLet me remind you forcefully that in the case of many of these crises it would be sufficient if the provisions of resolutions already adopted by the United Nations were respected. Think, for example, of southern Lebanon, occupied, torn asunder and removed from the legitimate Lebanese authority; think of Namibia, whose independence and sacred right to sovereignty are endlessly delayed. The time has come solemnly to affirm from this rostrum and I do so now in the name of France that every possible means must be brought to bear to ensure that Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 435 (1978) are applied in full without delay. My country is ready to make a contribution to this effort on whatever lines are decided on by this Organization.\n25.\tIn certain situations we must go even further, and here again the United Nations has a significant role to play. Once Namibia has finally gained its freedom and independence through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), it must be helped, and probably guaranteed, in its first few years. Angola, which has suffered so much from war, must be assured of all kinds of support during its reconstruction. Kampuchea, already rescued from famine by international efforts, must be able one day to determine its future freely and democratically, and it too, of course, will need guarantees and assurances of every kind. Afghanistan, if it is not to run the risk of interference which has recently been denounced in some quarters, and if it is to put an end to the interference now made evident by the bloodshed of the battlefield, will need some guarantee of the status it seeks. In many quarters, and in the face of threats of quite different kinds, the same idea has been advanced, namely, to accept, acknowledge and guarantee the wishes of a people to be freed from the tensions that surround it and threaten its independence and its desire for nonalignment. France believes that this similarity of ideas about very different areas and situations provides material for consideration and a common approach at the international level.\n26.\tI am often surprised to note that in most circles the true dimension of NorthSouth problems is not understood. Some talk of charity for unfortunate starveling of some devastated country, others demand higher prices for their products or a transfer of some special technology. But how often do you hear it acknowledged, as it has rightly been acknowledged by the members of the Brandt Commission,  that the progress of the NorthSouth dialog is a prerequisite for world progress and perhaps even for world peace?\n27.\tThe South has become part of the life of the North. How much longer will it take for people to understand this? This is an essential aspect of the new age that is upon us whether we like it or not. What position will the South occupy and what part will it play? Those are questions that must be asked.\n28.\tFrom the political standpoint, I have already mentioned cases where the fundamental principles of the life of our people and our societies are being threatened or violated. Obtaining respect for such principles in southern Africa, the Middle East and Latin America is essential for those who believe in those principles. The French Government considers itself to be one of these countries. 1 will not return to this point, except to remind you how much our young people, the moving spirit of our so cities, are concerned with these problems, with which they are more familiar today, now that the media are tel ling them what is really taking place in the South, which was not the case a few decades ago,\n29.\tHowever, solidarity and interdependence transcend the political and moral realm. The world is riven by crisis, causing the number of unemployed to soar and condemning the most unfortunate to despair. Who can claim that this crisis will be set to rights or brought under control solely by the forces and mechanisms of the market place, and solely within the framework of the most advanced economies?\n30.\tEconomic revival, which we all need urgently and this is particularly true of the most underprivileged countries requires the development of the countries of the South. This is not just a matter of a few hundred million dollars, but of tens of billions of dollars, which must be injected wherever they are most desperately needed and where their effect will be almost immediate in improving purchasing power and, as a result, in expanding markets. Elsewhere I have spoken ? a planetary \\\"new deal\\\" in order to recall this obvious truth which President Roosevelt, when confronted with America's great depression, identified in his day.\n31.\tIt is important, therefore, for all of us together to tackle the issue of financing development and indeed the issue of the very survival of those who are most deprived. Where can the available resources be found? How can we organize the use of those resources? Where should we channel them? What kind of link should be established between the funds that all those who can should contribute, the lending capacity and administrative supervision of competent institutions, and the rightful concern of lenders and investors to guarantee the security of their investments? A few answers are ready and have been proposed. They must no longer be delayed or distorted. But they will not be enough, so let us strive to see how we can do more and better.\n32.\tNaturally, since the resources to be shared are unfortunately inadequate, our thoughts should turn first to those who are suffering most, sometimes to the point of death. My country was very happy to host in Paris the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.\n33.\tMy Government notes with satisfaction that commitments were entered into by the international community and we are pleased that the countries of the European Community decided to commit 0.15 per cent of their total gross national product to help the least developed countries. France, for its part, as the President of the Republic has said and I repeat, will attain the United Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent of its gross national product, excluding the French overseas departments, before the end of Mr. Mitterrand's seven-year term. This in fact commits us to doubling in real terms our aid to the developing countries. France's effort will, starting in 1982, give priority to increasing its voluntary contributions on a multilateral basis and to aid countries with which it has special ties, particularly in Africa.\u2003\n34.\tAs we are all aware, it is not enough just to increase financial aid. So I ought to say something now of special aspects that should take priority: food, energy and trade. However, the time allotted for these remarks will not sufficed Allow me to focus on two aspects of the new international order that I believe to be essential.\n35.\tPredictability has now become an essential feature of tomorrow's order. Without 'it, how can one plan, organize, formulate and invest in a rational manner? But never before in history have the principal factors of economic life been so unpredictable. You only have to think of the prices of basic commodities imported by countries in the South, the prices for raw materials exported by the developing countries, the exchange rates and interest rates that influence all transactions. We are living in a world with out order, a chaotic world, an insane world. We the European countries without significant natural resources are suffering along with the countries of the South. In the face of speculation and uncertainty, our interests are those of the South; in this debate, we are with the South.\n36.\tIt is important therefore gradually to introduce a system of law in world economic relations. We must seek contracts, treaties and international agreements. One of the innovations of the Lome Conventions between the European Community and 61 developing countries is to make the relations they embody predictable and reliable.\n37.\tAnother feature of those Conventions is their comprehensiveness. Even more so at the world level, all of the economic, financial and technological problems should be discussed and negotiated simultaneously and jointly. The foregoing is justification enoughs France and its European partners are resolved that global negotiations should be started at the United Nations at the earliest possible time. We shall exert all our influence to see that no further delay is imposed. This is to be confirmed in a month at Cancun, at the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development.\n38.\tThe global nature of NorthSouth problems seems evident to almost all of us. But have we given sufficient thought to the interaction between those external problems and our domestic problems? The new order will include major structural changes in each of the industrialized countries. The overall progress made possible by this renewal will be reflected in certain sectors by a decline in activity that will be more than compensated for in other sectors. New directions will be taken, and they will come up against resistance.\n39.\tThese things will not be done if in the industrialized countries discussions are limited to diplomats, bankers, administrators and other experts. It is important to involve public opinion, the workers who are directly concerned and the young people whose future is at stake. The media have a key role to play here, and they can do so. There are times when strong feelings are aroused in towns and in the country side, when the misery and suffering of a downtrodden people give the more fortunate television viewer a moment of discomfort and indignation, or when despair in a crisis becomes unbearable.\n40.\tI have just mentioned the NorthSouth dialog in its worldwide framework. But we must also consider it in the regional framework.\n41.\tThe region is in fact the natural context in which peoples can express their special identity; the similarity of problems, cultural affinities and sometimes even rivalries, as well as common threats, make it possible to multiply ties within a region or subregion. The more highly structured and grouped a region is, the less outside influences come into play there. This is an important way to avoid the contagion of East-West division in areas that are not directly involved. In the economic domain also, the cooperation that is so desirable among the countries of the South can .be encouraged in a rational manner, as was so clearly demonstrated at the very interesting HighLevel Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held recently at Caracas.\n42.\tIt is premature to try to take stock of the activities of the major regional organizations because their responsibilities and importance continue to grow. As a Frenchman, however, I am sure I will not surprise the Assembly when I say something about the European Community. It is still far from perfect, but its results are already evident in a number of different areas agriculture, the monetary system, the Lome policy, the generalized system of preferences and its authority is growing rapidly in the world. The French Government is planning to launch soon a number of new and exciting programs industrial, social and others within the Community.\n43.\tIn the economic sphere, reference should also be made to the United Nations regional commissions. The role of the Latin American countries as precursors in identifying a regional image and regional pride should be noted. We should mention the various regional groups such as the Association of South East Asian Nations [ASEAN], and quite a number of African regional organizations. I should like to pay a tribute to the most important of them, the Organization of African Unity [OAU], which at its recent Assembly of Heads of State and Government, held at Nairobi, dealt in a masterly fashion with some of today's most difficult problems. Thanks to the OAU we now have some hope of seeing a united and independent Chad, free from foreign interference, resume its place in Africa's concert of nations. And it is of course thanks to the OAU that we are hoping to see a referendum of self determination take place soon among the peoples of Western Sahara.\n44.\tThe development of regional cooperation has been so convincing in some parts of the world that we are tempted to set new goals. For historical and cultural reasons disputes may exist between neighbors, sometimes going back several centuries. There are many of us in this Assembly who are worried that East-West rivalry may be superimposed on those differences. Mutual distrust between two neighbors may indeed lead to an arms race. The risk then becomes great that they will all come to depend on increasingly sophisticated and therefore more costly arms supplies. What will then remain of self determination, independence and nonalignment, to which both parties are entitled?\n45.\tCan we not rather imagine that the group of countries most concerned by a confrontation of this kind among two or more neighbors might have the wisdom to limit the effects of the dispute, to establish a regional or subregional system for the evaluation of military forces, and even to conclude a genuine regional agreement on self-limitation of armaments, accompanied, of course, by appropriate means of control and verification?\n46.\tFrance has been shocked, as have so many others, by the disproportionate efforts that so many third-world countries must devote to arms and defense. We are disturbed by the growing dependence that this evolution inevitably en tails, and we fervently hope that the attempts that have already been made to slow this trend will be encouraged by our Organization and supported by world public opinion.\n47.\tWhatever the interests in a regional approach to arms limitation, the effort should, of course, culminate in this Organization. Nothing durable or solid can be built without the endorsement of an institution whose role it is to be universal. There is hardly a domain that is outside its jurisdiction, and the wholly democratic structures it possesses serve to guarantee the value of its decisions. On this rostrum from which I am speaking, every speaker and therefore every country is equal.\n48.\tThe fact that emphasis should generally be placed on the unique role of the United Nations in the most dangerous crises is only normal, because one immediately thinks of Cyprus, southern Lebanon, Namibia and also UNHCR, UNICEF and so many other organizations which, in tragic circumstances, have so well demonstrated human solidarity. But we know that the United Nations has other functions and that, in meeting places that figure less often in the major international press, ideas are compared that gradually lead to a consensus that will generate progress. I have in mind also the arms limitation talks, where gains have been made and where decisive steps are still to be taken among others, the establishment of an international satellite monitor ing agency.\n49.\tOther ideas, still more ambitious, direct our attention well beyond the immediate future. Next year the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament will give all of us an opportunity to shoulder our responsibilities. My country will play its part, and we will make a loyal and far-reaching contribution to the search for ways of defining conditions for a just and sure limitation of arms.\n50.\tNor do 1 forget that in many ways this Organization and the specialized agencies play an operational role, whether in terms of technical or humanitarian aid, or in more general regulations. In this regard, I should like to emphasize my country's special interest in the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The convention that that Conference is busy drafting will soon define how these riches of the world should be rationally organized in the future. It will mark extraordinary constitutional progress and will leave its imprint on the history of the world. The United Nations can and should be proud of it. Consequently, and in spite of a few reservations on details, the French delegation believes it essential that the work of the Conference on the Law of the Sea be concluded as soon as possible. We appeal to one and all to cease the maneuvers which have had the effect of jeopardizing the progress made over so many years of persevering effort.\n51.\tMy last remark should confirm what has already become obvious from my observations namely, France's commitment to the United Nations, from which the world expects so much.\n52.\tOur status as a permanent member of the Security Council, our human and economic resources, the independence of our policy towards all, whether States or great corporations, and our sympathy although that is too weak an expression our feeling of fraternity with the weakest, most deprived peoples, assure us, we believe, of special relations with most of the world. But they also create for us special obligations. At the global level, as indeed in France itself, the Government of which I am a member knows what is expected of it. We are ready.\n"

        "file_text": "\nMr. President, the delegation of Pakistan extends to you its warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your elevation to this high office is a tribute to your rich experience and deep understanding of international affairs and to your outstanding contribution to the work of the United Nations. We are confident that with your qualities of leadership and your dedication to the ideals of the Organization, you will be able to guide the deliberations of this session with distinction and success. It is a matter of special pleasure for us that you are from a country with which Pakistan enjoys traditional bonds of close friendship.\n157.\tI should like to express our deep appreciation for the outstanding leadership provided by your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the previous session of the General Assembly.\n158.\tMay I take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his unremitting efforts over the years to defuse critical situations constituting threats to peace. We wish him even greater successes in his endeavors, on behalf of the international community, for the consolidation of peace and the welfare and progress of mankind.\n159.\tThe United Nations is richer today by the birth of two nations. Pakistan greets the independence of Vanuatu and Belize and warmly welcomes their arrival in our growing community. We look forward to a relationship of mutual friendship and cooperation with the Governments and peoples of these new Member States.\n160.\tAs the Secretary-General has pointed out in his annual report, fresh strains in international relations over the past year have aggravated the problems with which the world is confronted [ibid., sect. /]. The heightened tension in EastWest relations, as reflected in the new arms race involving a whole range of new nuclear weapons and the expansion of conventional armaments, and the lack of a dialog between the superPowers has further complicated the problems which smaller countries face in various parts of the world. Their situation has been compounded by the involvement of regional States in strategic relationships with the superPowers. The small States, therefore, have a vital stake in detente and in mutual accommodation between the two greatest Powers, provided that this accommodation is not reached at the cost of their own independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n161.\tAs we look around us, we observe a multiplicity of situations, any one of which could, in the present state of superPower confrontation, spark a wider conflict. While the United Nations grapples with many serious problems which are still unsolved, new sources of conflict have emerged to claim our urgent attention.\n162.\tThe most serious threat to world peace continues to be posed by the conflict in the Middle East. The crux of the problem in the region remains the continued denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self determination and the establishment of their own independent State in Palestine. Indeed, the situation has gravely deteriorated over the past year. Not only does Israel remain as intransigent as ever in respect of Palestinian rights: it has intensified its aggression in Lebanon. Not only does Israel continue to occupy Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, in defiance of United Nations resolutions and world opinion: it has expanded its aggression to Iraq.\n163.\tThe devastation inflicted on Lebanon by Israeli air raids and incitement to religious war among its people is a matter of the most anguished concern to Pakistan. I should like to pay a warm tribute to the Foreign Ministers of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria and to the Secretary General of the Arab League for their extraordinary efforts to promote peace and reconciliation among the Lebanese factions and to preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.\n164.\tIsrael must not be allowed to continue its lawless conduct with impunity. It is high time that the international community went beyond condemnation of Israel's behavior and took effective measures to restrain its future conduct.\n165.\tA just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem cannot be negotiated without the full participation, on a basis of equality, of the PLO, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. It is a matter of regret that the European Community has not yet followed up its Venice declaration of 13 June 19805 with a concrete plan of action. The point plan recently advanced by Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia is fully consistent, we believe, with the relevant United Nations resolutions and deserves serious attention. We believe that this plan can serve as a basis for a comprehensive approach to a just and lasting Middle East peace settlement to be negotiated at an international conference.\n166.\tPakistan, both as a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the nonaligned movement, has always supported international efforts to bring peace and tranquility to the Middle East on the basis of complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, full respect for the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State.\n167.\tEven as the Middle East cauldron continues to boil, the situation in neighboring Afghanistan brings a new and more immediate threat to the security of our region and to world peace. Pakistan's geographical location does not permit it to escape the consequences of the internal conflict in Afghanistan. The situation in that tormented country is not of Pakistan's making.\n168.\tWe reject categorically the baseless and wholly propagandist accusation that Pakistan is responsible for the widespread national resistance in Afghanistan. That\npeople's struggle is entirely indigenous in character and represents the traditional response of the Afghan people to any challenge to their sovereignty and independence. The so-called situation \\\"around\\\" Afghanistan is a fallout from the turmoil within that country and will be resolved when conditions there return to normal. Today's painful realities in Afghanistan cannot be obscured by hurling abuse at Pakistan.\n169. We heard from this rostrum a few days ago that the toiling people of Afghanistan have never lived better than since the April revolution and have begun to reap the fruits of a new, just and equitable social system. May we not then ask why one fifth of the total population of Afghanistan has fled the country and why those who remain inside are so implacably opposed to it?\n170. Nearly 2.5 million Afghans have sought refuge in Pakistan, preferring to face a life of great hardship away from their ravaged hearths and homes. Indeed, the exodus continues unabated. The care and sustenance of this vast mass of displaced humanity is an awesome responsibility and an enormous burden. Pakistan bears half of the total expenditure required; we are grateful for the assistance we have received in this regard from UNHCR, the World Food Program, from other humanitarian organizations and from a number of friendly countries. While this assistance enables us to ensure the minimum welfare of the refugees, a great deal still needs to be done. The international community has a clear obligation to remain concerned . with the humanitarian dimension of the Afghanistan crisis so that the consequences of this grave human tragedy can be mitigated.\n171.\tIt is a travesty of facts to attribute to Pakistan any motive other than a purely humanitarian one in fulfilling its international obligations towards these refugees or to allege that Pakistan has allowed its territory to be used as a conduit for the flow of arms to the mujahideen. Pakistan's frontier with Afghanistan stretches over more than 1,400 miles of territory which features some of the most rugged and inaccessible terrain in the world. This area is inhabited by fiercely independent tribes who straddle the international frontier and have moved across it freely over the centuries. It is beyond Pakistan's ability to seal this frontier.\n172.\tThe key to the solution of the crisis in Afghanistan lies in the implementation of the principles laid down in the resolution of the eleventh session of the Islamic Conference, which has been fully reflected in General Assembly resolution 35/37, of 20 November 1980. These resolutions call for a. political settlement based on the immediate withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan; respect for its sovereignty, national independence, territorial integrity and nonaligned character; the right of the Afghan people to choose their own economic, political and social system free from outside intervention or coercion, and the right of the Afghan refugees to return to their homes in safety and honour. These principles were endorsed by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of NonAligned Countries held at New Delhi in February of this year.\n173.\tThe United Nations provides the only practical mechanism for a dialog among the parties directly concerned directed to a resolution of the crisis in Afghanistan. It is with this objective in view that we are prepared to set aside procedural problems and engage in an exchange of views on substantive issues through the Secretary-General or his representative, and at the same time prepare the ground for trilateral talks between the representatives of the Governments of Pakistan and Iran and those of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, as soon as circumstances permit. We have already conveyed to the Secretary-General our position that such an exchange of views may begin immediately.\n174.\tIt is our earnest hope that the talks which we visualize through the intermediary of the Secretary-General will set in motion an irreversible process of dialog for peace. If all the parses participating in this process are sincere in their search for a peaceful settlement, we may look forward to an early resolution of the internal conflict in Afghanistan and its external repercussions.\n175.\tOur quest for an early political settlement of the Afghanistan crisis has an extra dimension in the context of our relations with the Soviet Union. The crisis in Afghanistan, with its attendant complications, is an encumbrance on this relationship which we would wish to see removed as early as possible.\n176.\tWe are prepared to cooperate to the limit of our capacity in the implementation of any international guarantees linked to the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan according to an established timetable. These guarantees would naturally ensure respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all the States in the region on the basis of strict observance of the principles of nonintervention and noninterference.\n177.\tThere is a parallel situation in Kampuchea, where external military intervention has also taken place in violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As in the case of Afghanistan, so in that of Kampuchea: Pakistan fully supports the call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea and the exercise by the people of Kampuchea of their right to determine the'* destiny.\n178.\tPakistan participated in the International Conference on Kampuchea held in New York in July of this year, which yielded positive results. We are hopeful that the efforts to establish a national coalition government will pave the way for a negotiated political solution in Kampuchea.\n179.\tThe people of Pakistan are deeply anguished by the prolonged conflict between the brother States of Iran and Iraq. This tragic war has caused extensive suffering and bloodshed and inflicted colossal damage on the economies of the two countries, It has further exacerbated the climate of insecurity in an already troubled' region. Pakistan has made every effort, at the highest level, individually and together with other Islamic Heads of State, to restore peace between Iran and Iraq on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the charter of the Islamic Conference. President Ziaul Haq, accompanied by the Secretary-General of the Islamic Conference,, Mr. Habib Chatty, undertook a peace mission to Teheran and Baghdad in September last year.\nHe continued this mission, together with other Heads of State and Government members of the Islamic peace committee, in two subsequent visits to the two capitals during the course of this year.\n180.\tWe hope that those and other mediation efforts, including that undertaken by the United Nations, through Mr. Olof Palme, will succeed in bringing to an end this fratricidal war, which has placed in jeopardy the security of the entire Gulf region. As an immediate neighbor of Iran and traditional friend of both Iran and Iraq, Pakistan has a special interest in a speedy resolution of this conflict on the basis of the principles of international law and justice and respect for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of both countries.\n181.\tThe Third Islamic Summit Conference, held at MeccaTaif in January this year, focused its attention on the key problems of the region, more especially on Jerusalem, Palestine and Afghanistan. In the Mecca declaration, the Islamic Conference proclaimed that the preservation of the security of the Gulf is the exclusive concern of the countries of that region. Pakistan is committed to this declaration. We welcome the establishment of the Gulf Cooperation Council to promote economic and other forms of cooperation among its member States.\n182.\tIn common with the other littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean, Pakistan remains seriously concerned over the growing buildup of greatPower military presence in the Indian Ocean and the deterioration in the climate of peace and security in the area. We fully support the call for an early convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean, which should pave the way for the realization of the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, ensuring genuine security and respect for the sovereignty, national independence and territorial integrity of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean'. We also support the call of nonaligned Foreign Ministers, made in the meeting held at Delhi last February, for the start of a process of reduction of superPower military presence in the Indian Ocean area.\n183.\tJust as we share a 1,400 mile-long international frontier with Afghanistan, we have a common 1,200 mile-long border with India. We fully recognize the imperative of developing and maintaining good-neighborly relations with both those countries. A bitter chapter of our relations with India closed with the Simla Agreement of July 1972.6 We have sincerely tried ever since to implement that Agreement in letter and spirit.\n184.\tThe Simla Agreement also provides a framework for the peaceful settlement of all disputes and differences between the two countries. Most of them have been resolved since the Agreement was signed. The only outstanding dispute pertains to Jammu and Kashmir, which, we believe, should be resolved in the spirit of the Simla Agreement and in the light of the relevant United Nations resolutions.\n185.\tThe historic forces working in our region today demand that Pakistan and India should respond to the new realities by a sincere effort to forge a new relationship of mutual trust and confidence on a lasting basis. It is with that objective in view that we have declared < m readiness on several occasions in the recent .past to join with India in building a durable structure of peace between our two countries. Our proposals have ranged from a mutually acceptable ratio of forces and levels of armaments to the conclusion of a nonaggression pact.\n186.\tPakistan is only one fourth the size of India and has almost one tenth its population. The disparity in resources and in industrial and technological development is equally striking. Pakistan cannot therefore pose a threat to India under any circumstances. We are not in competition with India in an arms race; we remain totally preoccupied with the security concerns which are peculiarly our own. Given the extent of our frontiers and the security threat to which we are exposed on account of the developments in the region, we have no choice but to maintain a minimum defence capability necessitated by the size and the geo strategic situation of Pakistan. It is wholly incorrect to characterize our sovereign right to strengthen our security as subordination of our interests to the strategic designs of any superPower.\n187.\tThe people of Pakistan may be forgiven if they feel concerned at our neighbor's propensity to misinterpret our objectives and to speak of clouds of war. For our part, we feel that circumstances are building up in our region which offer us the opportunity of the century to achieve lasting peace between our two countries.\n188.\tA beginning has already been made to provide for bilateral consultations between Pakistan and India on matters of common interest on a continuing basis and also for cooperation in a multilateral framework with India and other countries of the SouthAsian region in certain agreed fields.\n189.\tA politically motivated propaganda campaign is being persistently carried on against Pakistan's peaceful nuclear Program. It is being given out that \\\"suspicious\\\" activities have come to light at Pakistan's nuclear power reactor near Karachi. It is patently false to say that anomalies and irregularities have been detected at the site. This reactor is under the safeguards system of IAEA and has been subject to regular inspection by the Agency ever since it went critical, the latest inspection being in August last. It is the height of irresponsibility to speculate that spent nuclear fuel can be diverted clandestinely from the reactor for non-peaceful purposes. There has not been a single instance of violation of safeguards by Pakistan during the past 45 inspections carried out by the Agency so far, and on each occasion the IAEA team certified that the situation in regard to the observance of the safeguards by Pakistan was entirely satisfactory. The Director General of the Agency is also on record as having expressed his appreciation for the cooperation extended by Pakistan to his inspectors in carrying out inspections and fuel verifications of the nuclear power plant in accordance with the existing agreement with the Agency.\n190.\tPakistan has also accepted additional safeguards with reference to its nuclear power reactor at the behest of the Agency and will continue to extend its fullest cooperation in the future. Since the Conference of NonNuclear Weapon States in 1968, Pakistan has consistently demonstrated its dedication to the goal of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, beginning with the proposal presented to that Conference for strengthening Security Council resolution 255 (1968) by transforming certain security assurances into positive guarantees to nonnuclear weapon States against the threat of use of nuclear weapons. Since that time we have been in quest of negative guarantees from the nuclear weapon Powers not to threaten the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear weapon States.\n191.\tThe international community is aware that Pakistan has taken several initiatives to keep its area free of nuclear weapons. In the United Nations Pakistan has been making consistent efforts for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. As a first step towards that objective, Pakistan has proposed the adoption of a joint declaration for non-acquisition of nuclear weapons by the regional States. Pakistan has also offered India inspection of the nuclear facilities of the two countries on a reciprocal basis. I am happy to say that in a joint communique issued at the conclusion of the Indian Foreign Minister's visit to Pakistan last June the two countries reaffirmed that their respective nuclear Programs were entirely for peaceful purposes.\n192.\tIt is a matter of deep concern that adherence to IAEA safeguards and even to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons has not been sufficient to secure the legitimate right of States to have access to nuclear technology for their development. A case in point is the Israeli attack on the Iraqi nuclear installations which, in the words of the Director General of IAEA, was an attack on the Agency's safeguards system itself. The Israeli act signifies a new dimension in its aggressive policy in the Middle East which is being outrageously cited for emulation elsewhere.\n193.\tI turn now to general disarmament. The growing tension in EastWest relations presents the fearsome prospect of a new escalation in the nuclear arms race, which in the words of the Secretary-General is the greatest potential danger threatening mankind. We therefore welcome the recent agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to enter into a dialog on the reduction of their theater nuclear forces in Europe. We hope that that will be a first step towards the early resumption of negotiations on major reductions of strategic arms and the start of an irreversible trend towards nuclear disarmament and the strengthening of international peace and security. The self-restraint shown by the two superPowers in abiding by the limitations imposed by SALT I and SALT II is a source of great satisfaction to us.\n194.\tThe major nuclear Powers are already spending over $450 billion a year on their armed forces and armaments. That expenditure is about to take a quantum jump by the acquisition of yet more sophisticated nuclear weapon systems and new weapons of mass destruction. This continued escalation of the arms race directly and fundamentally jeopardizes the vital security interests of all States and enhances the risks of a nuclear war, which would endanger the very survival of mankind.\n195.\tThe adverse international political climate has stultified progress in the disarmament negotiations in Geneva. Even in respect of the highest priority item namely the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, no advance has been made for the last.several years. The prime negotiators seem determined to reserve for the nuclear-weapon States the prerogative of conducting nuclear explosions.\n196.\tThe Committee on Disarmament has not been allowed to open negotiations on any of the broad range of issues relating to nuclear disarmament. Even where negotiating mechanisms have been established, such as on radiological and chemical weapons, the major nuclear Powers have shown a singular lack of sensitivity to the concerns and proposals of the nonaligned and neutral countries. On the comprehensive Program for disarmament, fundamental differences in approach between them and the nonaligned member States have dimmed the prospects of consensus.\n197.\tRight from the inception of disarmament discussions in the United Nations the highest priority has been assigned to measures of nuclear disarmament. The General Assembly has adopted several resolutions on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. No serious efforts have been directed towards achieving that end. Less ambitious proposals, such as non-first use of nuclear weapons, have been put forward from time to time, but rejected as militating against strategic military doctrines. The Vienna talks, which have remained stagnant for the past several years, need to be pursued with new vigor to bring about agreement on the levels of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, if prospects of an accord on the non-first use of nuclear weapons in Europe are to emerge.\n198.\tThe situation in southern Africa remains a serious threat to regional and international peace. The persistence of the inhuman system of apartheid enforced by the racist regime in South Africa is a continuing challenge to the international conscience and a potential threat to peace. Pakistan fully supports the struggle of the African National Congress to dismantle that abhorrent system and restore the dignity and human rights of the entire people of South Africa.\n199.\tEmboldened by the acquisition of a formidable military machine with the help of certain developed nations, the racist regime in South Africa has repeatedly committed with impunity acts of unprovoked aggression against its neighbors. It continues its illegal occupation of Namibia and uses Namibian territory as a springboard for persistent armed attacks on Angola. Pretoria has also intensified its repression of SWAPO, which is leading the liberation struggle. Pakistan joins the world community once again in condemning the racist regime in the strongest terms for its most recent aggression against Angola and for its flagrant violation of Angola's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n200.\tThe effort mounted by the international community to bring independence to Namibia has reached a decisive stage. The recently concluded eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly underlined the international consensus behind Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the need for the immediate implementation of the agreed independence plan.\n201.\tWe have noted the statement of 24 September by the five Western countries which comprise the contact group on Namibia. Their intention to begin, discussions on \\\"constitutional principles . . . likely to secure the confidence r? all concerned\\\" may well defeat the objective of implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in 1982, if the discussions seek to revise or dilute the independence plan.\n202.\tThe inordinate delay in the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia is intolerable. There should be no hesitation in setting a definite date for the independence of Namibia. Should it fail to meet the deadline the United Nations must proceed forthwith to the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist regime.\n203.\tIn this context, I should like to pay a tribute to the role of the OAU for its efforts on behalf of the national liberation movements and in the solution of disputes among African States, including those of Chad and Western Sahara. The efforts of the seven nation committee to bring about a ceasefire followed by a referendum in Western Sahara deserve high appreciation.\n204.\tPakistan shares the deep concern, expressed so eloquently by previous speakers, at the alarming deterioration of the economic situation, particularly of the developing countries. Their economic stagnation and declining growth, their large external deficits and mounting debt burdens, their losses from adverse terms of trade and growing protectionism, rising prices and falling real incomes for the hundreds of millions living in absolute poverty in the developing countries need no reiteration on my part. Suffice it to say that the growing ills of the world economy are deep rooted and need fundamental structural changes.\n205.\tThe imperatives of interdependence have failed to receive adequate recognition even though it is an acknowledged fact that developing countries are the greatest source of trade expansion in the world and their economic wellbeing is essential for the health of the world economy.\n206.\tThe global negotiations, to which the entire international community is committed, have yet to be launched. Expectations from the Ottawa summit meeting have remained un-fulfilled. Not only has international development cooperation received a serious setback, but today the very basis of multilateral cooperation has indeed been put in doubt. International economic negotiations have lost momentum and, where limited agreements have been reached, these have remained largely unimplemented.\n207.\tPakistan hopes that the Nairobi Program of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy, adopted by the Nairobi Conference, and the Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, adopted by the Paris Conference will be implemented effectively and expeditiously. We especially welcome the agreement reached in Paris to double development aid by 1985 to the 31 least developed countries with a population of 280 million.\n208.\tThe international consensus of the need for world food security, that has existed since the World Food Conference of 1974, has yet to be translated into reality.\n209.\tDespite the Agreement Establishing a Common Fund for Commodities a modest fund the negotiations on arrangements for individual commodities are moving at a painfully slow pace.\n210.\tThe work in the areas of trade, technology, industrialization and monetary reform has been equally disappointing. The adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade was an important step which provided a comprehensive framework for international development cooperation. But if the present negative trends continue, it is difficult to envisage how the goals and objectives of the Strategy can be realized.\n211.\tOur hopes now center on the forthcoming Cancun summit meeting to impart impetus to international development cooperation and facilitate early launching of the global negotiations However, Pakistan reiterates the view, consistently held by the Group of 77, that global economic problems can best be advanced within the universal framework of the United Nations.\n212.\tOn the other hand, the developing countries, following the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held at Caracas, demonstrated a new impulse towards collective self-reliance. We are convinced that the Program of Action adopted by that Conference [see A/36/333] will yield balanced and lasting benefits, consolidating the solidarity of the developing countries and enhancing their negotiating position with industrialized countries. They, however, do not regard economic cooperation among developing countries as a substitute for NorthSouth understanding. An integrated and comprehensive solution of global economic problems cannot be achieved without the participation of all the countries concerned. In this context we associate ourselves unreservedly with the call made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France for the adopting of bold new policies of cooperation between the developed and developing countries [9th meeting].\n213.\tIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm our determination to uphold the rights and duties of States under the Charter of our Organization, our commitment to the principles of non-alignment our dedication to the realization of the objectives of h.? Islamic Conference. We firmly believe that only by honoring these obligations can we make a lasting contribution to world peace and the future wellbeing of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": ".\nMr. President, the friendly relations which link Iraq, your country, with mine make it a very special pleasure for me to convey to you my warm congratulations and to express my best wishes for your success following your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n3.\tYour competence, based on long experience acquired in the course of a distinguished career, and your thorough knowledge of the Organization, its objectives, its activities, its methods of work, have led you quite naturally to invite the General Assembly to depart from a repetitive litany of declarations and decisions without real impact in order to devote itself completely to its primary function of safeguarding and strengthening the peace and progress of mankind.\n4.\tThis realistic approach to international problems was reflected in an original proposal made at the first meeting by your predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, an eminently qualified diplomat and a man of outstanding human qualities. Being an able diplomat, the President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly wisely called for a meeting of the Presidents of the five preceding sessions of the General Assembly with a view to improving the methods of work of the Organization. We are grateful to him for thus having called upon the profound dynamism and wealth of wisdom of our continents.\n5.\tIn reiterating our esteem for him, we express the wish that this proposal will be promptly acted upon. There is no doubt that Africa, through the voice of one of its distinguished sons who guided the proceedings of the thirty-fourth session in masterly fashion, as we all know, will make a valuable contribution to this work of shading a new world.\n6.\tThis is an excellent opportunity for me to convey to my friend, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and his able colleagues the tribute they well deserve for their tireless dedication to the cause of the United Nations. We have spoken with this remarkable diplomat on more than one occasion, and he knows that each time we have listened to him with great interest because of his constant concern for restraint and his keen awareness of the complexity and delicacy of the countless problems in international affairs.\n7.\tThose who drafted the Charter of the United Nations had generous dreams of an outward-looking world in which the various nations, large and small, strong and weak, would extend their hands to one another and build a universal civilization that would shine with the brilliance of a thousand lights. One of those dreams becomes more of a reality from year to year. At this session the United Nations is receiving two new Members. The people of Vanuatu and the people of Belize are taking their places in the ranks of the free peoples of the world. The people of Mali greets and congratulates the peoples of those two new republics and assures them of our dynamic and fraternal co-operation in carrying out their national endeavors.\n8.\tThis emergence of new States has undoubtedly injected new vigor into the United Nations and success would certainly have crowned our hopes if it were not for the opposition shown by some Powers to the new spirit these young sovereign States are seeking to instil in the United Nations. Each session of the General Assembly should provide us with an opportunity to take stock of our achievements and to prepare ourselves for further successes which step by step bring us closer to our common goals.\n9.\tClearly the United Nations is continuing, year by year, its victorious march towards universality. However; mankind continues to live in anguish for the uncertain future. Mistrust and confrontation characterize, unfortunately, the present state of international relations. Armed conflicts have become a feature, particularly in the third world.\n10.\tLast year we hoped for a gradual subsiding of the political and economic turmoil that had shaken the world. Unfortunately, that has not been the case, and lie present session of the General Assembly has opened against an international horizon that is still dark.\n11.\tOur common commitment to seek concerted, just and equitable solutions to grave international problems is\nvery seriously endangered by the emergence of contradictory policies and of hostile blocs feverishly preparing to impose their views on one another by force. Coexistence among States, instead of bringing new promise, has turned towards aggression.\n12.\tThe Powers whose many privileges have given them the principal responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security have adopted behavior that remind^ one of the night before the battle. The climate of detente which had in some measure allowed different political, economic and social systems to lay the foundations of cooperation to the benefit of all has seriously deteriorated. Ideological differences are unfortunately being settled on the battlefield.\n13.\tThe regrettable tensions thus generated have weakened our ability to find just, equitable and lasting solutions to the very fundamental problems that affect our .future. The aspiration of our peoples to live in dignity and in spiritual, moral and material tranquility is thus being increasingly jeopardized. Nevertheless, the Charter of the United Nations is a marvelous international instrument embodying ideals, concepts and principles which provide sure values for the growth of our civilization.\n14.\tI have come here on behalf of the people of Mali to give voice to our deep commitment to those principles, to those objectives, to those aims. Indeed, it is those ideals, those concepts and those principles that have fashioned the long and rich history of our people.\n, 15. The Republic of Mali deliberately joined the United Nations precisely because the Charter enhances human dignity. The Republic of Mali voluntarily became a Member of the international Organization because of its universal character, which is the source of its strength and determines its future.\n16. It is, therefore, aberrant., unjust and senseless that men who alongside their brothers in arms have courageously and worthily contributed to saving freedom should be kept under the yoke of colonial domination. Although decolonization has been inscribed in glorious letters in the annals of the United Nations, the history of this recovery of dignity by the world's peoples has not yet been written in its entirety. The process of total decolonization is being blocked, particularly in certain parts of Africa, our beloved continent, thousands of whose worthy sons have fallen heroically on foreign soil in alien wars the unsung heroes* of victories that have given mankind renewed faith in its own continued existence.\n11. Yes. Africa continues to feel the violence of foreign domination. Namibia, convulsed by opposing historical currents, now finds itself under the rod of the racist regime of South Africa. In point of fact, the sacred principle of\nself-determination a principle recognized by the United Nations and enshrined in its Charter, a principle consistently reaffirmed by the international community  is being flouted. United Nations sovereignty over Namibia was clearly established by the International Court of Justice. Its recommendations for leading that colonial Territory peacefully to independence, and the many resolutions of the General Assembly, have met only with scorn on the part of the racist i\u00a3gime of Pretoria. That reactionary regime continues ^. with total impunity, to pursue its policy of bloody repression, territorial expansion, blatant aggression and, thus, of serious infringement of international peace and security.\n18.\tThe recent deliberate invasion of the free and sovereign territory of the People's Republic of Angola is one further episode in this unacceptable policy of the South African racists. The Security Council, which on other, perhaps less urgent, occasions did not hesitate to mobilize troops to safeguard peace where the Council felt it to be threatened, on this occasion did not even deign to face the grave and inadmissible challenge being hurled at the entire international community by a regime condemned by the human conscience.\n19.\tAt the very least, the United Nations, which more than ever has the moral duty of supporting Namibia in its heroic march towards independence, should ensure the scrupulous implementation of resolution 435 (1978), adopted unanimously by the States members of the Security Council. Any attempt to water down that resolution, which remains the only valid basis for a settlement of the Namibian problem, is merely a desperate last minute maneuve designed to deprive the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people, of its rightful place at the global negotiating table.\n20.\tIt should be clear to all perpetrators of such maneuvers that, since one negotiates only with those who fight, SWAPO, which has taken up arms to free its fatherland, is the only party qualified to represent the Namibian people in any negotiations. This fact has just been forcefully reaffirmed by the recent emergency special session of the Assembly. All diplomatic, political, economic and military means should be used to combat a system which has' become a source of shame for mankind. We do not have the right to fail in so urgent a duty. To act otherwise would be to betray the mandate entrusted to us by our peoples to defend them against hatred and violence.\n21.\tYes, it is because it embodies racial hatred and violence that the apartheid regime continues to deprive the black majority in its long-suffering land of Africa of its elementary right to respect for human dignity. It would therefore be a labor of peace to isolate the racist regime, the regime of hatred for the black man, and to apply to it the relevant provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. To that end, I repeat from this rostrum the urgent appeal constantly addressed to the Western Powers, which have become so prompt to monitor respect for human rights throughout the world, finally to heed the anguished and unceasing cry of Africa for them to resolve together to serve the cause of justice and all mankind by helping the international community, which has been defied, to destroy the apartheid regime.\n22.\tUnfortunately, southern Africa is not the only part of our beloved continent that is feeling the effects of the last throes of colonial domination: the northwestern part of Africa is suffering on its flank the aftereffects of a still incomplete decolonization. I refer to Western Sahara, which is part of a geographical and human grouping to which my country, Mali, belongs. That area, which has fashioned its own identity characterized by the mutual enrichment of cultures, ways of thinking, a common view of the world, identical beliefs in the sacred nature of human life and a painful common heritage of colonial domination, indisputably constitutes the fruitful belly of our African continent.\n23.\tNow, at the very moment when, after many vicissitudes, one of the elements in this whole was to be the last to decide on its own future, serious tension has arisen; persistence could disturb the harmony that has always characterized the fraternal coexistence of the peoples of our region, the friends and neighbors of the people of Mali, peoples that legitimately lay claim to the same history, culture and faith.\n24.\tThat is why the people of Mali, committed to struggle for the triumph of\nself-determination and with a basic concern for the diplomatic stability and equilibrium of the region, chose very early on to work towards dissipating these tensions. In so doing, my country's only motive is to work for peace.\n25.\tTo that end, in order to enable our continental organization to get out of the impasse, Mali during the fifteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU\\, held at Khartoum in 1978 urged and succeeded in obtaining the creation of an instrument to prepare for deliberations among Heads of State on the question of Western\\\" Sahara.\n26.\tSince the establishment of this remarkable tool, succeeding sessions of the OAU Assembly have all enabled us to make\\\" real progress towards a coherent solution to this problem. Based on reports of the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State and Government on Western Sahara, and after having clearly indicated that the principle of\nself-determination remains the keystone of the painful fratricidal conflict in Western Sahara, the sixteenth and seventeenth sessions of the OAU Assembly, held at Monrovia and Freetown, took further steps to improve the atmosphere in that region. The last OAU Assembly, at Nairobi, also ended on an extremely encouraging note. At present, the stage of general considerations with regard to this subject has been completed, and we have even begun to consider specific modalities for a final settlement of the problem. The Implementation Committee that succeeded the Ad Hoc Committee and that was given full powers at the eighteenth OAU Assembly, will pursue its mission in a dispassionate spirit and in perfect and permanent harmony with all the parties concerned, in order to arrive at proposals that will ensure respect for the sovereignty of some and for the legitimate demands of others.\n27.\tFor its part, Mali wishes to assure the General Assembly that as a member of that committee it will work solely for the cause of peace.\n28.\tAfrica remains confident that the technical assistance requested of the United Nations to finalize the decolonization of Western Sahara will be forthcoming, for it is true that here too the preservation of international peace and security is involved.\n29.\tThe urgent problems of development re constantly being eclipsed by grave crises within and among African States, crises that are also sequels of the colonial phenomenon. Such is the case with the painful crisis in Chad, which remains one of the major concerns of the G\\U and particularly of the Republic of Mali, which, like that long-suffering country, is a member of our young regional organization, the Conference of Saharan States. The fratricidal war that took place there was a dangerous threat to the territorial integrity, independence and national unity of that brother country.\n30.\tAs in the case of the conflict over Western Sahara, it is imperative that the quest for a solution to this African problem remain African. Of course, an organized Africa should be able to rely in this rase also on the very valuable assistance of the international community in arriving at a final solution to the situation, based on the Lagos Agreement on National Reconciliation in Chad, of August 1979.\n31.\tElsewhere in Africa, border conflicts a further heritage of colonization often lead to senseless and devastating fratricidal wars. Convinced of the futility of war as a means of settling conflicts, especially among kindred States, Mali will tirelessly continue to make its modest contribution to the efforts of Africa to seek solutions to these African crises. In such crises, we should be able to stifle our rancors and transcend our differences in order to achieve peace, unity and concord on the basis of respect for the sacred principles of the OAU and especially on the basis of the principle of the inviolability of the borders inherited from colonization.\n32.\tOutside Africa, through non-respect of the universal principles enshrined in the Charter non-use of force, settlement of international disputes by peaceful means, noninterference in the internal affairs of others and the right of peoples to\n self-determination hotbeds of war and tension, far from diminishing, are spreading.\n33.\tThose principles, which constitute the basic elements of the foreign policy of Mali, are based on the profound conviction of the people of Mali that without these noble ideals, which should be the sole foundation of the international legal order, international relations would be impossible.\n34.\tAlthough the diplomatic history of the past four decades should have taught us that the use of force can never provide a permanent solution to the problems of nations and that without peace there can be no civilization, the strategy of fait accompli, the constant and heedless use of force, the patent and frequent violations of the Charter and of relevant United Nations resolutions all, unfortunately, ^constitute the daily actions of certain Member States of the Organization that calmly enjoy total impunity.\n35.\tLike the racist regime of South Africa, which, because it has been abetted and supported in its acts of international piracy, has violated with total impunity the territorial sovereignty of the People's Republic of Angola, its ally, the Zionist regime of Israel, arrogantly continues its illegal and prolonged occupation of the Arab territories it has usurped. What is more, in its conceit, Israel, defying the thousands who have placed their faith in the Eternal, have not hesitated to proclaim Jerusalem that thrice Holy City, which bears infinite testimony to the spiritual heritage of three revealed faiths its so-called eternal and indivisible capital. Even worse, the Zionist State is daily pursuing its inflammable policy with regard to Lebanon, which is being destroyed by its expansionist bombardments, and has not hesitated, with the same impunity, to violate the territorial integrity of Iraq.\n36.\tThe international community is duty bound to put an end to this unjust fact of history, to Israel's expansionist behavior that has forced the heroic Palestinian people to have recourse to armed resistance. The Zionist State, more than any other, should remember that one cannot with impunity attempt to exterminate a people, particularly the Palestinian people, which stands as a whole behind the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], its sole and authentic representative.\n37.\tBecause it lies at the heart of the Middle East crisis, the Palestinian problem remains the first that must be dealt with. Any peace process in the Middle East must take this major element into account. It is in order to bring to life this reality that voices in all quarters are being raised in favor of the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n38.\tThese are ajot only the voices of conscience. They are also the voices of reason. They can be heard at conferences, gatherings and seminars, from all those who have known the horrible consequences of the use of force. They aie heard among the rising generation and in Israel itself.\n39.\tThis language which is that of the people of Mali is also the language of the OAU, the language of the nonaligned movement, the language of the Islamic Conference; in short, the language of all peoples which give peace its true meaning and which are fighting to safeguard if, This language is in keeping with the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian militants and is in harmony with the many initiatives concerning the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n40.\tThe latest, highly historic initiative, taken by Emir Eahd ibn Abdul Aziz, Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, after the. important Third Islamic Summit Conference, held at MeccaTaif, deserves the full attention of the current session of the General Assembly.\n41.\tIndeed, this peace plan aims concretely at finding a comprehensive solution to the problem of the Middle East in general and the Palestinian problem in particular. The peace plan's eight points are in keeping with the relevant decisions of the aforementioned Islamic Summit Conference. They are in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations and the recognized and admitted standards of international law. Designed to liberate the Arab territories occupied by Israel, to preserve the physical and intellectual patrimony of the Palestinian people and prevent the Holy City of Jerusalem from being disfigured and diverted from its Original status as the common heritage of mankind, to ensure the exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable rights to  elf-determination and, finally, to recognize the right of all States of the area to live in peace, this realistic and balanced plan enjoys the full support of the Government of the Republic of Mali.\n42.\tWhichever way one turns, one can see brothers who at great price have won their independence in faith and\\\" national unity opposing and destroying each other. The guaranteeing of their independence and security eludes their grasp for, in fact, they are no longer the masters of their own independence and security. Interference in the internal affairs of other States seems to be acquiring ever increasing legitimacy from year to year.\n43.\tThis bitter observation should lead us to redouble our efforts to end all fratricidal wars.\n44.\tKorea, united in the struggle for the independence which it courageously won, has for too long been divided into two hostile camps. The reunification of Korea, united by its history, its geography, its civilization, its genius and the profound aspirations of its people, should be possible on the basis of the important proposals contained in the 10 points presented in October last by the President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea. There are not two Koreas there is Korea. There are not two Korean peoples; there is the Korean nation.\n45.\tThe troubling situations which seem to persist endlessly in Kampuchea and in Afghanistan are subject to the same analysis. Only a political settlement in keeping with the age old talents of these peoples is capable of providing definitive solutions with appropriate guarantees.\n46.\tForeign domination is not the only factor producing crises in international relations. The world seems to have settled into a state of endemic fear. The weak outlines of the detente of past decades are gradually being blurred. Diplomatic language is becoming harsh and brutal. Patient dialogF capable of bringing peace has given way to the threat and use of force. Military superiority considered as the only way to maintain a hypothetical international balance has led to a mad race to manufacture and stockpile weapons of war that each day are being perfected to improve their capacity for mass destruction.\n47.\tConferences on disarmament are bogged down. The Second Disarmament Decade, solemnly proclaimed at the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, has begun with sabre-rattling.\n48.\tMeanwhile, as new generations of terrifying weapons are being developed, with every second that passes, more than $16 million are swallowed up in armaments. Diverting a mere 1 per cent of these enormous arms expenditures, which now exceed the astronomic figure of $1 billion per day, to the preservation of life would put an end to the nightmare of millions upon millions of people and would open opportunities to the destitute of this world to enrich our civilization through their creative talents.\n49.\tAnd it is high time for this long-awaited change to take place. Indeed, the present international economic order is in no better shape than the difficult political situation. There too tension has arisen and restrictions in thinking have been introduced which have prevented the achievement of satisfactory results in the establishment of a new internatidnal economic order. Thus we find ourselves in a situation which is an insult to intelligence and common sense.\n50.\tEvery day we pride ourselves on our technical and technological prowess. We*have successfully begun to master the elements of our planet, whose secrets we have unveiled. We have carried out daring beyond the atmosphere; our planet abounds in vital resources; and we produce others when the need arises. And yet it is precisely at this time that the .most serious economic disorder confronts all mankind with, on the one hand, a very small minority staggering under the weight of riches that are frequently wasted and, on the other hand, an overwhelming majority suffering absolute poverty.\n51. The economic relationship between rich countries and developing countries, instead of being one of healthy and fruitful cooperation, is sliding towards that of subjugation. The many conferences devoted to reversing this unfortunate trend continue to accumulate ritualistic reports in place of practical solutions, in the absence of political will on the part of the technically advanced countries. The question is whether we are capable of making rational use of the vital resources of the world economy, whether we have decided to be partners in progress together and, finally, whether we wish to provide common answers to our common destiny.\n.52. The current crisis which is shaking the foundations of our whole planet is a general crisis, and it is an illusion to think that any oases of prosperity can be built in the midst of so much misery.\n53.\tIt is precisely to meet this whole range of political and economic concerns that the third world has refused to embark upon the sterile courses of confrontation and selfishness. That is why the nonaligned movement, of which Mali is a member, was created, and we are celebrating its twentieth anniversary with redoubled determination to see our ideals triumph.\n54.\tThis movement does not seek the impossible; its aim is to rally goodwill and it seeks a pooling of efforts to establish a just world. It is working for a decrease in international tension and the participation of all States, with no exceptions, in the management of international affairs. It aspires to establish confidence so that weapon stockpiles may give way to grain silos, so that hospitals and schools may increase in number in order to improve the quality of life and, lastly, so that man may be at peace with himself.\n55.\tThe proposals submitted by the nonaligned countries during the global negotiations for the establishment of the new international economic order derive from this. These negotiations have gone beyond the stage of definitions and analyses. They have made it possible to identify five fields: those of raw materials, energy, trade, development, and monetary and financial questions. The negotiations nevertheless remain deadlocked at this point, just as do the negotiations on the law of the sea.\n56.\tBut we are not the masters of time, and our peoples are impatient and anxious about their future. We therefore call for a manifestation of that political will without which, postponing deadlines, we are merely making the difficulties more complex and restricting, and casting our populations into turmoil and revolt.\n57.\tMali hopes that ways and means will be found for the effective launching of genuine global negotiations before the end of the present session. These global negotiations, advocated originally, let us not forget, this, by the nonaligned movement, should exclude no State Member of the Organization. It is essential that their .universal character be preserved. For that purpose the United Nations is the most appropriate framework.\n58.\tThis important question of negotiations must be examined in a spirit of dynamic interdependence in which every State, first mastering its own development, will participate in the integration of the world economy on a balanced and just basis. Thus it is that the new international economic order has fundamentally a national dimension.\n59.\tMali is aware of the present shortcomings of its economy, which have been aggravated by the fact that it is landlocked, by the severe consequences of the hostile and capricious climatic conditions it has suffered for 10 or so years and, of course, by the known, effects imposed on it by the serious crisis in the world economy.\n60.\tThat is why the people of Mali has mobilized itself in order to build an independent and planned national economy, relying on its own talents, on its enormous natural potential and on subregional, regional and international cooperation. This option of the Democratic Union of the Malian People is in keeping with Mali's effort to promote endogenous development. It is a national economy, because it is turned inward towards the satisfaction of our own needs and is no longer an outward looking economy. We wish to conduct our development by means of basic day-by-day actions in which all participate, so as to achieve self-sufficiency at the local level. This action, decided on by the rural populations and carried out by and for themselves within the framework of Tons, or village associations, provides the support for basic integrated development. It is an independent economy, because it is designed to master our resources so that they may be used for the improvement of the quality of life of all Malians, either by processing the resources on site or through as equitable as possible a system of international exchange. It is a planned economy, because it is based on the five-year plans which define the stages of our national effort and regulate our actions in terms of our fundamental objectives; Moreover, Mali has set itself a substantial program of action for accelerated development for the period from 1981 to 1990 within the context of the Third United Nations Development Decade, which is the principal instrument of the new international economic order.\n61.\tAn independent and planned national economy in Mali is therefore the internal dimension of the new international economic order. That is why our economy is oriented towards the world, conscious as we in Mali are of the need for progressive integration of our economies, so uniform is our ethic and so closely does the principle of individual and collective self-sufficiency advocated by the nonaligned movement and the OAU fit our national personality.\n62.\tIt is therefore not surprising that my country, Mali, should be a founding and dynamic member of all the regrouping in West Africa. One example is the organization for the improvement of the Senegal River, of which Mauritania, Senegal and Mali are members. Its key works are the Diama and Manantali dams, which will make it possible to control the waters of the Senegal River and produce electricity, irrigate extensive fertile tracts of land and open up a navigable waterway from the sea to the hinterland of Mali.\n63.\tWe cite also as an original joint undertaking, with political and social implications as important as its economic effects, the Authority for the Integrated Development of the LiptakoGourma.\n64.\tThis is designed to promote comprehensive development of a region common to the three member countries Upper Volta, Mali and Niger. This area will thus be at the same time a focusing point, a meeting-ground for economic and social development and a healthy attempt to go beyond the artificial question of frontiers through cooperation.\n65.\tfh the same spirit of unity and of maintaining a common front to face nature's challenge, Mali, Cape Verde, Gambia, Upper Volta, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Chad established in September 1973 the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel [CILSS] to help the victims of that natural calamity and to take action to protect our nations permanently from climatic disasters and the advancing desert and to exploit our immense potential.\nA\n66.\tAs I address the Assembly in my capacity as President of the Republic of Mali I am. equally conscious of the great responsibility that has been entrusted to me as current President of the Conference of Heads of State of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel.\n67.\tFirst of all, I should like to say that although drought is not a new phenomenon its dimension in the eight member States of CILSS is quite different from what it is elsewhere and what it was formerly. Today the countries of the Sahel are at the edge of a serious disequilibrium* which has caused one of the eminent personalities of our time to state that if we are not careful two or three of them might well be stricken from the map of the world before the end of the century. The expression \\\"polygon of famine\\\", which has frequently been used to describe the countries of the Sahel, is evidence of the tragic character for our peoples of the daily struggle for survival in an environment threatened by the advancing desert.\n68.\tIt is because we have confidence in the creative talents of our peoples, and because we believe that the present situation is not irreversible if appropriate measures are taken in time, that our countries have created this marvelous instrument of cooperation, CILSS. Anticipating somewhat the Lagos Plan of Action for the Economic Development of Africa, we have already decided to entrust as a major task to the Committee, the instrument of our solidarity, the elaboration of specific strategies and the implementation of clearly defined policies designed both to limit the effects of the drought and to promote the development of the. region.\n69.\tThe first results of this work have led us to lay down for our countries the strategic objectives that you are aware of, namely, self-sufficiency in food, the restoration of the ecological balance and water control to meet the requirements of the population, livestock and crops.\n70.\tWe should like to express our profound gratitude to all States, groups of States and other generous donors who have responded to our appeal for international solidarity with the people of the Sahel, and I am pleased here to recall the eminent role of the, Sahel club in alerting world opinion, the constant efforts of the United Nations system in this general mobilization and, finally, the effective and unprecedented contribution of the Islamic Conference. The last named, indeed, decided to set up the Committee of Islamic Solidarity With the People of the Sahel [see At-361138, annex I, resolution 7/3P(IS)]. That Committee, in less than six months, was able to collect the sum of $210 million as the first contribution for the launching of our program to bring our economy under control.\n71.\tIt is in terms of our strategic objectives that we have defined a common program for the rehabilitation and development of the Sahel up to the year 2000. In order to carry out this program, we are firmly relying upon increasing support from the international community, by means of which the Sahel, with its potential water and soil resources, could become not only the breadbasket of Africa but also a great world food reservoir.\n72.\tThis action of regional cooperation towards collective self-sufficiency fits in perfectly with the African strategy defined by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at Lagos in April 1980. This Lagos Plan of Action was duly taken into account by the General Assembly when it adopted, at its thirty-fifth session, the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [resolution 35/56]. This is a significant contribution by Africa to the implementation of the new international order, for a more equitable international division of labour, for a more balanced management of the world economy and for a more responsible participation by all members of the international community in the progress of mankind.\n73.\tOne observation must be made. Many countries, particularly those of the third world, are today on the verge of being stifled. It must be recalled that virtually all of the members of CILSS are among the least developed countries of the third world, 21 of whose 31 members are African.\n74.\tThe means to be placed at their disposal so that they can participate in the general progress was recently examined in Paris at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. These means, which are aimed at achieving, among other things, an equilibrium in the balance of payments, the writing off of their debts, the supply of financial and technical means in order to render their economies more dynamic, have been included in the Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries.1\n75.\tOur purpose has been to offer to the community of nations specific' and viable examples of cooperation. We consider ourselves to be one of the links in the immense network which we must knit together as a defense against underdevelopment. Our goals, our efforts, must be understood as being complementary to the commitment which we have undertaken together to fight for the harmonious expansion of all of our economies.\n76.\tThese efforts are designed to achieve the establishment of a new just, equitable and constructive international order. Quite simply, the purpose is to enable man to^ assume fully his sacred rights to existence. In particular, it involves guaranteeing freedom for all, creating a climate of confidence among our nations and further strengthening international peace and security so that war and poverty become no more than hideous memories.\n77.\tThe colonial system, even in its death throes, is still disturbing international order. Famine is crushing increasing millions of human beings in its fearful tentacles. Racism is still showing its virulence.\n78.\tTogether with you, we wish to restore the confidence of our people in their creative abilities. Together with you, we wish to preserve international peace and security. For we have committed ourselves by common accord to remain faithful to the purposes and principles of the Charter. We have committed ourselves by common accord to \\\"promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\".\n79.\tThe Republic of Mali will keep its promises.\n80.\tThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of Mali and Chairman of the Conference of Heads of State of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel for the important statement he has just made.\n"

        "file_text": "I come to this rostrum with mixed feelings: first, a sense of deep trust, which makes me see the United Nations as the supreme resort, a very special place where justice and peace reign, an irreplaceable springboard for efforts to bring about concord, understanding and solidarity among nations. This is a very powerful and sincere feeling, and it is ultimately that feeling which made me leave my distant country, Niger, to come here and speak to the Assembly in this crystal palace in Manhattan.\n4.\tBut I have another feeling, less exalted perhaps, because it is more practical, more human, more suited to this fine, distinguished Assembly which is greeting me today. It is a sense of vague dissatisfaction, born of certain demands and well-meaning criticism which make me regret that the United Nations is not always able to match the ideals of its Charter and the immense trust placed in it by most of the countries of the world.\n5.\tI am not here to praise the institution, nor, above all, am I here to add to the conceit of, at times, excessive criticism and often unjust accusations, which in fact reflect only inner bitterness or even deep disappointment. Niger harbors no bitterness or disappointment to be blamed on the United Nations; quite the contrary.\n6.\tMy purpose is simply to tell the Assembly how much concern my country, which for nearly two years now has been a member of the Security Council, feels at the problems of the hour, in the settlement of which we firmly intend to play our part, and how much we hope that the United Nations will carry out its role in the best interests of the world as a whole.\n7.\tAt this stage let me say how fortunate I feel to have this opportunity solemnly to reaffirm the unconditional devotion of my country to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations the basis for relations among States as providing the best way to ensure international peace and security.\n8.\tWe are opposed to any violation of the Charter. We condemn any transgression of the fundamental principles of sovereignty, independence and equality of States, regardless of their territorial dimensions, their geographical location, the level of their development or their political, economic, social or ideological systems. We proclaim the inviolability of the territorial integrity of States. We recognize the inalienable right to self determination and independence of peoples under a colonial or racist regime or foreign occupation or domination. We recognize their right to. take action, to struggle and to battle to achieve the goals to which they aspire as a nation. We promise them our active solidarity.\n9.\tMay I say to you, Sir, that we welcome your accession to the presidency of this session of the Assembly in which we see a sign of hope and a symbol: a hope of the irrepressible and enriching awakening of the third world and a symbol of the restoration of the powers of the voiceless, and dispossessed and the neglected, who are now unanimously determined to secure recognition of their rights.\n10.\tYou are a worthy son of the Orient, which is based on faith and a glorious history, endowed with immense resources, but sharing with Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific only faint hopes for a less painful future and the terrible suffering of endemic deprivation that is as unjust as it is shocking.\n11.\tI am therefore not surprised that throughout your career, a particularly long and brilliant one, an effort to defend the poor and fight for equity among nations has been evident.\n12.\tThe General Assembly has wisely placed its fate in your hands and thereby paid you an undying tribute that no speaker at this rostrum can possibly match. I will content myself with encouraging you to continue to work for peace, justice and equity. May you hold aloft for Iraq,\nfor the Arab and Islamic peoples, for the third world and for the entire world the proud banner of hope, assistance and unity handed on to you by your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar.\n13.\tMr. von Wechmar was a distinguished President. I address to him our sincere compliments on his tireless efforts during the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly to launch the global negotiations, which are so necessary and so urgent and on which the tranquility of tomorrow's world may well depend.\n14.\tThese are indeed ominous times, marked by increasingly serious inequalities and quite understandable and often legitimate impatience, times marked by discouragement because of un-kept promises. The system desired and created by the great Powers of the world persists. Thanks to that system the rich calmly preserve their individual and collective wellbeing, while the economic dependence of the third world increases. Therefore there can be no progress towards the new order so enthusiastically supported here, which is supposed to correct inequalities and redress existing injustices, and ensure steadily accelerating economic and social development for present and future generations.\n15.\tNever, I repeat never, before has there been such a growing gap between the wealthy and those whose only concern is to have enough food merely to survive and to preserve their threatened dignity.\n16.\tThe present world economy is in such a state of imbalance that the new criterion for regrouping, for alliance and for division among nations is, in the final analysis, wealth or poverty. Let us not be led astray by ideological differences: everything is now governed by these two contrasting realities, which bear dangerously within them the stigma of exploitation and the potential for confrontation. Countries are no longer grouped according to their size, their special abilities, the abilities of their continent or the virtues of their civilization and history. They are now divided simply into rich and poor, the rich systematically dominating the poor and the poor paradoxically having no alternative but to follow in the seductive wake of the rich.\n17.\tThis difficult situation results largely from the inability of the existing international financial and economic structures, which were set up nearly 40 years ago, immediately after the Second World War, to adapt to present day needs.\n18.\tIn spite of certain minor changes that have taken place, the principles on which those structures are based essentially favor the dominant economies. Thus, if the countries of the third world have been able to play an increasing part in international trade, the net result for them has not been the means to ensure self-sufficient development.\n19.\tThe deterioration in the terms of their trade with the developed countries, which is one of the greatest scandals of our day, has constantly worked towards a reduction in real terms of their return on exports.\n20.\tAt the same time, the foundations of the world monetary system have been shaken by the deterioration in the position of the principal reserve currency, and this has caused erratic variations in the exchange values of currencies and brought about a period of instability and intense speculation.\n21.\tThe system inevitably led to its own disorder and its own crisis. Then the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] raised the first significant challenge to the established order.\n22.\tThat awakening in November 1973 had a considerable impact. That collective action on the part of a group of developing countries, producers of primary products, was strictly in line with the resolutions and the program of Action of the fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of NonAligned Countries, held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973, and clearly reflected the urgent need to establish a new international economic order, which was endorsed several months later in the Declaration and program of Action adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at the conclusion of its sixth special session, in April 1974, devoted to raw materials and development [resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)].\n23.\tThat action revealed, at the same time, the vulnerability of the wealthy countries, the need for a fundamental reorganization of economic relations among the developing countries and the advantage for those countries in working together to establish among themselves a dynamic strategy for economic cooperation.\n24.\tThis double phenomenon of the awakening of awareness among the poor and the fragility of the bases of supremacy of the rich is not without certain risks, in so far as it shows a lessening of moderation, willingness to share and generosity.\n25.\tIn order to survive, mankind must therefore have the will and the means to prevent the disastrous trends which may arise from the excessive thoughtlessness of the rich and the frustration of the developing countries.\n26.\tBecause of the unproductive waste of immense resources in the arms buildup, the developing countries cannot attain the quite modest levels of official assistance set by the United Nations.\n27.\tTheir debts have, as a result, only increased. In 1970 their debt amounted to $74 billion and debt servicing amounted to $9 billion. By 1980, that is, in the 10 years corresponding, paradoxically, to the pompously named \\\"Development Decade\\\", their debt had increased to $456 billion and the cost of debt servicing had increased to $91 billion.\n28.\tEven food assistance the urgency and humanitarian nature of which is emphasized every day by the extension of critical zones of malnutrition at times seems to be losing its ability to attract support.\n29.\tWhat can be done to remedy this situation? How can we ensure that the impatience of the South and certain too conservative reactions of the North do not lead to a world dominated by discontent, fear and anxiety? How can we convince the community of nations that if we are at this unhappy pass it is unfortunately because of the lack of will to reach a compromise between privilege and privation.\n30.\tAs regards the North, the response to these questions is to be found, in my view, in the courageous admission that yesterday's privileges are already endangered and will be even more endangered if attempts are made to perpetuate them without recognizing their anachronistic and excessive nature.\n31.\tAs regards the South, it is possible for those countries to play a more active, effective and better integrated role in the affairs of the world, particularly in the areas of the processing, marketing and distribution of raw materials. All this should be done in a spirit of harmony and cooperation with the advanced countries and in an effort to bring about equitable and sincere complementarity.\n32.\tWe shall spare the world from a very damaging economic confrontation only if together we overhaul NorthSouth relations and work together for a more unified approach to the development of the world and for the wellbeing of mankind. I am sure that I shall surprise no one when I say that the unfairness, the irrational and fraudulent distribution of the resources of the world, the deprivation of all kinds and the various types of suffering and hardship caused by the economic deficiencies to which I have referred are extremely dehumanizing and dangerous, and must be ended.\n33.\tIn the new economic order which must be brought about, the North must make it possible for the South to grow and prosper and play a full role in the international economic system.\n34.\tThe main routes to this beneficial development have already been perceived, cleared and marked out. I shall limit myself to indicating the indispensable areas in which action is urgently necessary.\n35.\tThe North must give up at once all idea of a club system and all persecution complexes and rapidly agree to a certain number of major reforms in regard to the structures of the existing international economic system. I am thinking here in terms of changing the balance of world trade; the stabilization of prices, particularly of raw materials, on which the developing countries are so dependent; and courageous monetary reform. But the North must also get used to the idea that since industrialization is an inevitable stage of development and our countries will have need of access to markets as well as of investments and will inevitably turn to the North for the outlets which are necessary for the. future expansion of their industrial production. We mean by that that the protectionist policies of the developed countries must be reconsidered and ended and must be replaced by internal changes actively directed towards wisely-chosen specialization, towards raising the purchasing power of their citizens and eliminating unemployment and inflation.\n36.\tBut it would appear, unfortunately, judging from their clearly egocentric reactions to the energy crisis, for example, that these countries are still nurturing tendencies to turning a deaf ear each time the South braces itself and refuses to accept the crumbs which for so long have been served it. However, the Economic Summit at Ottawa last July and especially the excellent atmosphere of mutual understanding which last August marked the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy at Nairobi perhaps suggest that things will evolve differently in the future. May the International Conference on Economic Cooperation and Development soon to begin at Cancan, Mexico, confirm this hope.\n37.\tThe North must then, or rather at the same time, set in motion a vast program of transfer of resources to the South to increase investments, speed up production and the processing of goods, transfer technology and promote and guarantee growth. It must commit itself to a speedy implementation of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held recently in Paris,1 which has just accorded timely recognition to the special problems of the least developed countries. Thus it must actively concern itself with the fact that the current economic and monetary situation is putting these countries in a clearly disastrous impasse, which calls for a rescue operation of solidarity, which will necessarily involve making special financial facilities available to them. In addition to the creation of a system to stabilize the prices of their raw materials these countries must have priority benefit of structures to help offset high interest rates, which are aimed at prolonging their recourse to profitable borrowing. furthermore, if there is no pure and simple cancellation of certain of their debts contracted for development purposes, they must be granted a moratorium that takes into account periods of crisis such as the present one.\n38.\tThe North must also insist that the Governments of that group of countries which have not yet attained the goal of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product make the necessary political effort in order speedily to reach this level of official development assistance, so that at the end of this century at the latest the rate can reach approximately 1 per cent. In this connection I believe I should warn against theoreticians who advocate that the North need only actively promote its own development and the South's will follow in its wake. In my view, these theoreticians are preaching an outmoded and erroneous thesis, which even smacks of a certain revival of paternalism  can no longer be accepted in good conscience by the South. If the South's development is to be viable and harmonious it must be endogenous in nature, respecting the views and the values of the South and making use as much as possible of the people and the resources of the South. Relations with the North will be meaningful, fruitful and equitable only if this is done. Of course, this presupposes that the developing countries will make a decisive contribution by implementing judicious horizontal cooperation among themselves. In this regard the Lagos Plan of Action, for example, constitutes a good Starting point for the States of the Organization of African Unity [QAU]. But that also presupposes that international action will be able to play a truly worthwhile role within the context of a body of social and economic reforms that can be welcomed by each of our countries.\n39.\tIt goes without saying that, given the undeniable problems confronting them, the developed countries may argue that their means are insufficient. In all objectivity, that must be conceded. But in their case insufficient means is not synonymous with a lack of means, and it can^ never be stressed enough to them that their development would greatly benefit from being freed from warlike tendencies and an end to the arms race. Mankind, which aspires to its wellbeing, happiness and survival, really has no need of all the weapons and death-dealing machines which it is being so feverishly pushed to acquire, only to find itself in the final analysis the only possible target of its own observations. The incredible figure of military expenditures for this year alone is $500 billion.\n40.\tFinally, the North must support and contribute massively to the World Food program, in particular by vigorously supporting the implementation of the programs of FAO and especially the Plan of Action on World Food Security. Those parts of the Brandt report advocating an especially urgent aid program of $4 billion a year and longterm measures to help the poorest countries to break out of the cycle of famine and hunger must be viewed by the developed countries with goodwill and acted upon speedily. And here I should like to encourage the World Bank and the IMF to persevere in the new directions they have mapped out; namely, for the World Bank, the liberalization of its operations in order to contribute to the antipoverty program dealing, in particular, with agriculture and rural development; and, for the IMF, the decision to consider with interest the reports supporting the prolongation of its financial assistance to member States with low incomes whenever these countries, as is often the case, suffer from the consequences of poor harvests or have to deal with a substantial increase in world prices of foodstuffs.\n41.\tThese are a few thoughts which, were they to be further developed and applied, would perhaps make it possible to improve NorthSouth relations and make them more healthy, thus opening up, at a timely moment for our planet, opportunities for harmonious and balanced economic evolution in which all mankind would be able to live and flourish in renewed hope of increased well being, which is so necessary if its great yearning for happiness and dignity is to be satisfied.\n42.\tThe creation of such a climate, marked by sustained efforts to ensure equity, active solidarity, international mutual assistance and generosity, would also have the great advantage of bringing about the conditions for an economic detente capable of preventing in future such crises as the energy crisis, which would only be new consequences of the weariness of the poor in the face of unceasing exploitation by the rich. After all, no one is any longer questioning the relationship between present energy problems specifically oil supplies and general questions of structural change in the world economy. Any realistic strategy aimed at making the dialog between petroleum producers and industrialized countries productive will necessarily involve development problems. I fear that the same will soon be true of other export products.\n43.\tThat is why, once again, there is great urgency. It is urgent that the prices of other primary products should not soar as did oil prices, which as a reaction, as I just said rose abruptly by 350 per cent in 19731974 and by a further 140 per cent in 19791980; it is urgent that the world be protected from such an economic catastrophe, from which many countries probably would not recover  among them, of course, the smallest and weakest countries already bowed down beneath the intolerable cost of their oil bills.\n44.\tI do not wish any longer to convey the impression that I have come to this rostrum solely to discuss economic problems. Unfortunately, there are other subjects, other threats, other forms of discord which are disrupting the world every day and on which I must dwell on such an occasion. My country, which will soon be concluding its two-year term on the Security Council, has had adequate time, on many occasions to state its position on most of the situations disturbing the conscience of nations and seriously threatening the peace and security of the peoples of the world.\n45.\tI must, however, recall Niger's grave concern over the arrogance and terrorism of Israel in the Middle East and the incredible stubbornness, the constantly defiant attitude and the stalling tactics of South Africa, which continues illegally to maintain Namibia under its colonialist and racist boot and to oppress its own black majority under the inhuman laws of its contemptible policy of apartheid. But, in doing so,~I shall not engage in unnecessary lamentations, for those two countries have heard so many pleas, reproaches and condemnations that they have become immune to them and no longer respond to the injunctions of the world except by overreaction or scorn.\n46.\tLet Israel merely know that its tranquility, development, survival cannot be found in military power or in war, but in a peaceful and rapid settlement of the Palestinian problem. Its stubborn desire to pursue its policy of aggression, expansion, confiscation and frantic judaization of the Arab territories that it has occupied since 1967 will probably do less for its future than would a courageous willingness to cooperate with the international community in order to reach agreement on the ways and means of bringing about a just and lasting solution to that sad problem, which is eminently political and human. It must in any case realize, having lived through the recent suffering of its own people under Nazism, that neither pogroms, nor brutal oppression, nor blind persecution will defeat a people whose selflessness and collective determination are ennobled every day by each new fallen martyr in its ranks. The Palestinian people is entitled to a land, a home, a country. As for the Arab States of the area, no one can reasonably wish to destroy them or humiliate them to the point of inducing them to renounce their duty to help their Palestinian brothers to win back their inalienable rights and their dignity. Finally, Jerusalem must be allowed to enjoy international status, for that status alone is compatible with its prestige as the city of three religions.\n47.\tThe case of South Africa is more troubling in another way. After 15 years of open rebellion against the United Nations and the international community, it\nseemed that the moment had come, in January 1981, for the racist authorities of that country to relish victory in tranquility by finally freeing Namibia within the framework that they themselves had weighed, considered and accepted that is, the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). But their insults during the Geneva talks were so spectacular and so resounding that the entire world still seems not. to have recovered from them.\n48.\tBut the truth of the matter is that South Africa holds extremely valuable aces that are given, alas, enormous weight by its vast riches cards that the OAU and the international community together will probably not be able to trump by a mere flood of speeches and resolutions. The support that it is able to line up in this hall alone gives it peace of mind while it embarrasses us, for its partners are essential and precious to us as well; they have long proved that they know how to defend the freedom of peoples and respect the dignity of races.\n49.\tLet us none the less repeat to South Africa and to its partners and allies that the Namibian problem has gone on long enough, that the Namibian people and their sole representative the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] have. suffered enough, that the front-line States have paid enough, and that the patience of AMca and of all peoples that love justice and freedom has limits and has now reached the breaking-point. The independence of Namibia must be speedily won and proclaimed if we wish to spare Africa and the rest of the world an increase in unnecessary tension that will only lead us to upheavals with irreparable consequences. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains a suitable basis for that task and one that, logically, must not be discarded. We would ask the contact group of Western States, which have assumed de facto responsibility for that task, to bear that point firmly in mind and to act swiftly to ensure that Namibia is present soon at this prestigious gathering of sovereign and free nations, the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n50.\tBut the problem of South Africa will not then automatically be settled, for that country is still the embodiment of racism, intolerance and humiliation. The apartheid which rages there is an inhuman practice. No man, no State, no people can rest peacefully as long as that country continues to mete out and with constantly redoubled, force the brutality, the persecution, the torture, the humiliation, the arbitrary imprisonment and the banishment so long the lot of the black South African majority which pays thus, with courage and self-sacrifice, for its only crime that of being black and of wishing to be a living and important part of mankind.\np\n51.\tHow often has it been proclaimed from this rostrum that apartheid must disappear? How many resolutions have been adopted here, and elsewhere in the world, condemning South Africa for that shameful policy and even imposing sanctions on it? But if apartheid, alas, continues, it is because once again the weight and influence of the Western partners have not been brought to bear sufficiently on the problem. That is why I trust) towards them and say solemnly to them once again that apartheid is a serious threat to peace, that apartheid is a grave defiance of all mankind, and that any search for world\npeace must begin by combating and eradicating apartheid.\n52.\tOur task in the United Nations is to do our utmost to maintain peace where it exists, to restore it where it is breached, to protect it wherever it is found to be fragile or threatened. But we must also recognize that peace is not fragile or threatened only in southern Africa or the Middle East. It is also fragile and threatened in Kampuchea, in Afghanistan and in many other parts of the world, for the very serious reason that a fundamental principle of our Charter is still not properly respected, namely, the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of States, a principle which, in turn, presupposes the unacceptability of the use of force, or threat of the use of force, in relations among nations. But let us all agree that that principle has not lost its relevance and that it is not only vital to the future of all countries but, above all, to that of the United Nations and of all mankind.\n53.\tI would not be so imprudent as to conclude this statement without referring to human rights, to the rights of the peoples of the world and to the canons of democracy. I simply wish to say that for us in the Niger, man is priceless. That is why our intelligence and our actions are devoted to the search for the wellbeing of the people of the Niger.\n54.\tWe are aware that our small, but worthy, population belongs to the group of economically weak countries. We are the proud inhabitants of a very harsh and unyielding land, which is both a stimulus and a hardship. That is why we are all committed, as a matter of urgency, to the building of our nation, and we have little time for questions of prestige, nor do we indulge in overhasty actions.\n55.\tTo feed the people of the Niger, to house them, to educate them, to take care of them, to clothe them, so that they can worthily be present at the gathering of the nations that for the moment is our only program and our only pretension. But probably only those who, like us, have suffered thirst, ignorance, sickness and hunger can understand the appropriateness of those choices; only those who have been exposed to want or have been the victim of humiliation will be able to understand why we wish to struggle to be self-sufficient in food, to free ourselves of hardships caused by the unpredictability of the weather and to build a society marked by development.\n56.\tThose, then, are the main goals of our struggle, the reasons for our mobilization and the motives of our hopes. It is true that we still have great difficulty in providing subsistence from our soil, because it is poor and infertile. It is difficult indeed for us to cope with the world economic environment, which demands far different means than our present rustic and pitiful capabilities. But we, as a nation, have enough endurance to continue the struggle, enough faith to continue the work and enough humility to recognize our weaknesses and to seek the cooperation of the world.\n57.\tWho more than we could wish for peace and internal concord in order to build and grow? We wish for j peace and international harmony so that we may assist each other and bring, about sincere cooperation among States.\n58.\tIn the Niger we are ardent supporters of peace, tireless workers for good-neighborliness and fervent apostles of dialog and understanding among nations. We condemn any desire for domination, whether from the East, the West, the center or the periphery. We abhor injustice, intolerance and inequity. We refuse to accept instability or the threat of instability not only in our country but also in our region, on our continent or anywhere in the world.\n59.\tWe are grateful to the United Nations for everything it has done to maintain the unity and cohesiveness of the world; to bring about and protect the freedom and dignity of peoples; to foster the wellbeing of man and the development of mankind. Thanks to its vitality and its high prestige, the Organization has done well. But it can do more, provided we give it the necessary means and, at the same time, scrupulously respect the provisions of the Charter to which we, as free and independent nations, subscribe in the interests of their inalienable sovereignty.\n60.\tI wish to end on this exhortation for, together with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations is certainly the finest, the most noble and the most relevant document that mankind has ever adopted. It is by honoring it, therefore, that you will give supreme substance and active weight to your work.\n61.\tWords fail me here as I try to convey our gratitude to and our admiration of all those men and women of all races from all continents who have chosen the United Nations as their country and who are attempting to come to grips with harsh present realities in an effort to prevent our species from sweeping away the world by its own excesses. In the vanguard of those men and women we find, of course, the familiar figure of the SecretaryGeneral, whose devotion to the cause of the Organization is undeniably beyond praise. A vigilant servant of the Charter and a tireless pilgrim of peace, he has regularly demonstrated his practical knowledge and his exemplary tenacity. Thanks to his diplomatic talent, his dynamism and his ardent devotion, he has raised the United Nations to the highest peaks, where it has found trust, prestige and credibility. On behalf of the Niger, I wish to congratulate and thank him.\n"

We urge Israel to comply with Security Council resolution 465 (1980) and all resolutions relevant to the restoration of the historic character of the Holy City of Jerusalem.\n11.\tMauritius is particularly concerned with events in Africa, South-East Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and appeals to all countries directly involved to accept the good offices of the United Nations and other regional groups to negotiate with a view to finding an acceptable solution to the problems which are inflicting untold miseries upon the inhabitants of those countries.\n12.\tWe must admit that the present session Is meeting at a time characterized by serious threats to detente.and the . beginning of yet another unbridled arms ..race. Ail. the Member States seem to agree on the need for nuclear disarmament,, limitation of strategic arms and establishment of nuclear-free and demilitarized zones, but, unfortunately, .what is actually happening is that the world is spending $500 billion yearly on armaments alone while 500 million people throughout the world are today starving because one tenth of that , sum is not available. My delegation hopes that the major Powers will contribute significantly to making the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, scheduled for 1982 success.\n13.\tIn years ago the General Assembly adopted a resolution to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], but .events in the region have converted the Ocean into a zone of fear and tensions. However, bad it not been for the significant role of the United States in the Indian Ocean, social, economic and political stability would have- been considerably affected iu the countries bordering the Indian Ocean,\n14.\tWhile political tensions and wars are endemic, economic crisis has today become pandemic. The main problems of the world today are mass unemployment, inflation and balance of payments deficits, which constitute a direct threat to social democracy in the third world. Such a situation is indicative of the insufficiency of the present world economic order. Almost all of the speakers who have preceded me are unanimous on this unfortunate state of affairs, if we do not act now I am afraid that a still . larger number of developing countries will be pushed to the verge of economic and financial collapse. If the present slow-moving negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order are not revamped and backed by the necessary political will, the world will witness unprecedented confrontations between the rich developed countries and the poor developing countries. Such a confrontation will be in the final instance detrimental of the whole of humanity.\n15.\tIn this context we thought that the Brandt Commission would have come to the help of the world. We welcome the forthcoming meeting of the North-South dialog which fa due to be held at Cancun. My Government is hopeful that some kind of Marshall Plan will evolve from this meeting which.will contribute to helping the third world countries overcome their economic ills. We deeply appreciate the positive conclusions reached  at the United Nations Conference on theLeast Develop Countries held recently in Paris\n16.\tIn the face of mounting debts, high costs of borrowing and decreasing foreign aid, the more fortunate developed countries should search for more automatic ways of transferring and redistributing wealth from the rich north to the poor south. The opportunity, my Government feels, is produced by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The sea-bed, with its estimated $24 trillion worth of nodules and other sources of wealth now lying in international waters, belongs to nobody, so perhaps to everybody. These immense resources are the common heritage of mankind, and they should be mined in accordance with international agreement and control. This\noffers a chance to the nations which have , already developed the necessary technologies for' sea-bed mining to 'distribute the unexpected, windfall of the ocean !is wealth for the common good of mankind. - Perhaps this is a unique opportunity dramatically and, painlessly to narrow the hitherto growing gap between the rich and poor, My delegation therefore welcomes the proposed International Sea-Bed Authority with powers to exploit the mineral resources of the sea-bed and to distribute them under a well-defined international convention.\n17.\t1 wish to conclude on a human plane. Mauritius has a special interest in the plight of the disabled In our country and the disabled everywhere. No issue is more revealing of the humanism that has always been the hallmark of the United Nations. Much progress has been made with .the proclamation of the year 1981 as the International .Year of Disabled Persons, to the extent that the General Assembly decided [resolution 351133] that the item should be considered in plenary meeting. The Advisory Committee for the International Year of Disabled Persons has examined the possibilities of continuing the activities of the International Institute for Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons in Developing Countries on the basis of the results achieved in 1981 [see AI36l471IAdd.l. sect. Ill], We hope that this further step of .progress will be authorized.\n18.\tFinally, I reiterate my faith in and dedication to the principles enshrined, in the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In electing him the Assembly has recognized both his outstanding personal qualities as a diplomat, deeply versed in United Nations affairs, and the growing importance of Iraq, a country with which Ireland has recently developed closer relations. I wish also to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, who presided over the last session with great skill and dedication. I join in the tributes which have already been paid to our SecretaryGeneral for his untiring efforts in the cause of peace in such difficult times.\n151.\tIt is a pleasure to welcome to the General Assembly the representatives of Vanuatu and of Belize. My country, as a member of the Security Council, had the honor to join in recommending both for membership of\nthe United Nations.\n152.\tThe international outlook in this month of September 1981 is sombre indeed as sombre as it has been at any time in recent years. Change and flux have always been a feature of international life, but as we start this session of the Assembly it must be clear to all of us that strains and pressures are building up in many areas to a dangerous degree.\n153.\tFirst, over the past year relations between the superPowers have deteriorated, and there are signs that the next year may bring a period of challenge and confrontation rather than of dialog and agreement.\n154.\tSecondly, the prospect of any serious effort towards disarmament seems to be receding. The talk is rather of new weapon systems, of higher defense spending and of the possibility of actually fighting a nuclear war.\n155.\tThirdly, tensions in several regions where there are serious problems of long standing have increased dangerously over the past year. The Middle East and southern Africa continue to present problems that concern and threaten all of us. Conflicts continue in countries such as Afghanistan, Kampuchea and El Salvador, and there is open war between Iran and Iraq.\n156.\tFourthly, the general world economic outlook continues to be discouraging; and there has been little serious progress in the effort to reorganize the world economy on a fairer basis. Major change which is necessary in the common interest is no closer than it was a year ago, and many millions of the world's peoples have little reason to expect any early improvement in their lot.\n157.\tEach of those sources of conflict and tension is dangerous enough in itself, but the pressures they generate now seem to be intensifying and to be reinforcing one another. The result has been a general increase in international tension over the past year and an increased strain on the fabric and structures of international life.\n158.\tThe question for each of us, large or small, at the start of this session is how we can use the framework, structures and procedures offered by the United Nations and its family of related agencies to make the world at the end of another year less dangerous than it is today at the start of our session. Over the next three months the General Assembly faces a long agenda of issues in the political, economic, social, legal and human rights fields. The views of the 10 members of the European Community, to which Ireland belongs, have already been stated in this debate by Lord Carrington, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom [8th meeting]. I should like, in this national statement, to set out more fully the views of my own Government on the most important of the issues before us.\n159.\tThere is at least one area of importance where some significant progress has been made. This is the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which is probably the most ambitious global undertaking of the United Nations in recent years. The wide variety of issues and the different national interests involved have made the work difficult to complete, but considerable progress has been made and my Government is happy at the extent of the agreement already reached. Many fundamental issues have been negotiated to the stage where consensus seems feasible and only a few outstanding issues remain unresolved. I hope that the program of work which the Conference has set itself for the next session can be adhered to, so that it will be the final decision-making session, and that a comprehensive convention on the law of the sea can be adopted by consensus next year. \u2022\n160.\tOn the other hand, the deterioration of relations between the superPowers has blocked any real progress on disarmament during the past year. Mutual distrust has led instead to an emphasis on arming rather than on disarming. We all know the difficulties. Each Power or alliance views the arms which it acquires and stockpiles for itself as defensive. It is those of its opponents or potential adversaries which are seen as dangerous and contributing to tension. It is understandable that States should wish to ensure their own security. But the increase in the armaments which one side feels to be necessary to ensure its security increases in the same proportion the insecurity of its rival. So they are caught in an apparently unending arms spiral. The arms race becomes itself a cause as well as a consequence of increased international tension.\n161.\tThe nuclear arms race now seems to be in the process of escalating in an exceptionally dangerous manner. The theory of nuclear deterrence is one which many may have grudgingly accepted. My country has never believed that deterrence could be a really durable basis for a stable and peaceful world order. But until now, at least, this approach has been based on the assumption that nuclear weapons would Clever be used. There is now, however, a growing view in some circles that it might be possible actually to fight and to win a nuclear war. This new theory could mean that nuclear war, far from being unthinkable, could come to be seen as a rational instrument of State policy. Such a theory challenges the dictates of common sense and threatens to undermine the moral prohibitions which so far have averted the ultimate disaster.\n162.\tWhat we need now from the nuclear Powers are some practical measures of arms control which would limit the growth of nuclear weapons as a necessary preliminary to later agreement on their reduction. That at least would give some hope of progress on other disarmament issues. My delegation has been encouraged by\\\" the announcement that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to begin talks in Geneva on 30 November on limiting so-called tactical forces. But this can only be a small beginning in a world of nuclear danger. The world needs a good deal more, and needs it soon. For sometime now Ireland., like many other countries, has been pressing for a treaty imposing a complete ban on all nuclear testing in any environment, and pending that a voluntary moratorium on any further tests. This would be a token of the nuclear Powers' good faith and would help to dispel some of the increasing distrust which is damaging international relations.\n163.\tWe also believe that a new and serious effort is needed to strengthen the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons in order to prevent their further spread. There is an urgent need for a chemical weapons convention, particularly in view of some recent developments. We want to see early progress in other areas relating to disarmament, including so-called confidence-building measures to help diminish international distrust. A new more positive approach by all participants in the review conference of the Final Act of Helsinki, at Madrid, and at the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva would, we believe, help in changing for the better the present international climate.\n164.\tThe steady increase in military expenditure is not only dangerous in itself but also a wasteful diversion of the world's resources from development. Poverty, malnutrition, disease and illiteracy all the effects of under-development remain daily realities for the vast majority of the world's population. In terms of sheer numbers, more people today live lives of misery and want and more people die of hunger than ever before. This situation is an affront to the human conscience. Because of its universal character, the United Nations system has a vital role to play in promoting development. Ireland fully supports that role. We believe that the emergence of the NorthSouth dialog is one of the most encouraging achievements of international cooperation during the past decade. But it must be a real and constructive dialog and not a mere exchange of statements on existing positions. The problems are such that practical solutions must be found urgently.\n165.\tIreland wants to see a renewal, an expansion and a strengthening of the NorthSouth dialog. We believe that the United Nations has the capacity to respond to the demands of a new dialog as well as to the need for measures to accelerate growth in developing countries and to improve the global economy. In particular, we look forward to an early start on a process of global negotiations, which we believe will promote growth and development of benefit to the entire international community. Our hope is that the meeting next month in Cancun will facilitate and speed up preparations for the global negotiations. We want to see the fundamental issues tackled and imaginative but practical solutions devised to meet the many problems now facing us.\n166.\tI am happy to record that my Government, on coming to office three months ago, pledged that Ireland intends to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance by the end of this decade. This will.be done by progressively increasing our allocations for development assistance each year and will be accompanied by an emphasis on maximum effectiveness of our aid within a balanced overall program. In the context of the overall target we are committed to devoting at least 0.15 per cent of our gross national product to the least developed countries.\n167.\tConcern for human dignity, however, must not be limited to economic issues only. In recent years, situations in which society operates in such a way as to deprive people of their fundamental rights in a serious and systematic way have rightly become the concern of the international community as a whole. It is over 30 years since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In that period, the influence of the Declaration has increased immeasurably. The general principles of the Declaration have been given more detailed legal status through the human rights instruments subsequently adopted by the United Nations, and the Organization has developed its procedures and machinery for examining gross and consistent violations. We want to see that capacity improved. In particular, the section of the Secretariat dealing with human rights should be strengthened.\n168.\tEven though the United Nations is still in a position to investigate only some of the gross violations in the world, there is evidence that progress is being made in such investigations. The extension by the Commission on Human Rights of the mandate of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances reveals the willingness to investigate that widespread problem. The range of internationally agreed instruments enabling the.United Nations to take action in regard to specific categories of violation is also being widened. At this session of the General Assembly we shall consider, with a view to adopting and solemnly proclaiming, the draft Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.5 That is the outcome of nearly 20 years of work within the United Nations. It will define in some detail a very important human right the right to freedom of belief.\n169.\tAt this session the Assembly will also examine allegations of serious and widespread human rights violations arising our of conditions in certain Member States. I do not want to overlook violations in other countries, but I should say that the situation in El Salvador is a matter of particular concern to many people in Ireland. The callous disregard for human life in the political struggle and the murders which have taken place on a massive scale have shocked the world. We are convinced that the desperate plight of the population can best be alleviated by an end to outside interference and by the negotiation of a just and durable settlement. In this connection, Ireland accepts the principles underlying the recent Joint FrancoMexican Declaration on El Salvador, which, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Mr. Cheysson, said earlier in this debate [9th meeting], has served as a reminder of the need to let each people settle its own affairs by political and democratic processes.\n170.\tIn many regions of the world where there are conflicts or potential conflicts, the increased tensions to which I referred earlier can be clearly seen.' One such area is southern Africa, where Namibia is still occupied illegally, where acts of aggression continue to be launched by South Africa against other States in the region, and where the policies of apartheid are rigorously applied within South Africa.\n171.\tThe joint statement by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Western contact group on Namibia of 24 September 1981, has given us some hope that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will be implemented and that Namibia will become independent in 1982. We welcome that statement and hope that every effort will be made to ensure .that the negotiating process regains momentum. Should our hopes once again be dashed and South Africa again refuse to comply with the decisions of the Security Council on Namibia or attempt to postpone indefinitely Namibia's independence, we believe that the Security Council should be ready to discharge its responsibilities effectively and without delay. The seriousness of the situation in southern Africa and the need to achieve a rapid, just and peaceful settlement for Namibia, were demonstrated in recent weeks by the actions of South Africa against other States in the region, particularly Angola. I repeat here what we have already stated in the Security Council that Ireland condemns South Africa's aggression against Angola as a violation of Angola's sovereignty and of the Charter of the United Nations.\n172.\tUnderlying the problem of southern Africa is the apartheid system in South Africa. That is not an issue on which it is possible to maintain a neutral attitude. Apartheid constitutes a direct challenge to the values which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We have seen no meaningful changes in South Africa's apartheid laws. Rather, those appear to be applied in an increasingly ruthless manner. The South African Government removes thousands by force to so-called homelands; it applies the pass laws rigidly; it maltreats its political prisoners; it imposes harsh sentences on opponents of apartheid, such as the recent death sentences on a number of members of the ANC; it continues to impose banning orders; it systematically suppresses all efforts to move towards a truly democratic society.\n173.\tApartheid cannot succeed and the policies which flow from it will ultimately fail. Those in power in South Africa should face now the reality of their situation. Elaborate diversionary propaganda exercises aimed at persuading the world that all is well in South Africa deceive few, save, perhaps, those who devise them.\n174.\tThe Middle East is another area where a long-festering dispute has given rise to periodic outbreaks of violence on a massive scale which are dangerous not only for the region but also for the world as a whole. In recent months, we have witnessed the attack on the nuclear facility in Baghdad, the heavy casualties in Beirut on 17 July and the loss of further Lebanese, Israeli and Palestinian lives in hostilities in the IsraelLebanon border area. Those developments render all the more urgent the conclusion of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.\n175.\tThe Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, in his statement on behalf of the 10 members of the European Community, has already outlined the principles which we believe to be basic, and has emphasized our determination to work towards such a settlement, Ireland, as a member of the Community, fully shares those views. In the search for a way forward, we also consider particularly interesting and worthy of serious consideration the statement by His Royal Highness Prince Eahd of Saudi Arabia, setting out the principles advocated by his Government for a settlement.\n176.\tThis conflict is a particularly difficult and intractable one because it is a conflict of rights. We believe that acceptance by the parties to the conflict of the principles already enunciated by the member States of the European Community, namely, the right to security and existence of all States in the region, including Israel, and justice for all its peoples, is essential if progress is to be made towards a peace settlement. An integral element in these principles is full exercise of their right to self-determination by the Palestinian people within the framework of a comprehensive settlement in the negotiation of which all concerned, including the PLO, play their full part. It is our hope that each of the parties involved will be able to accept a role for the others in the negotiation of a settlement on this basis.\n177.\tLebanon is a particularly tragic casualty in the Middle East conflict. Its problems are largely a consequence of the larger conflict in which it has become a battleground. The cessation of armed attacks called for in Security Council resolution 490 <1981) of last July is holding, and this has brought, if not peace, some respite from violence. But experience has shown that to offer reasonable hope of something more than a temporary lull in hostilities such arrangements must be consolidated and built on. Ireland continues to contribute troops to UNI FIL, as we have done to nearly every United Nations peacekeeping operation since we joined the United Nations 26 years ago. I should like to pay a tribute to the courage and devotion to duty of the members of that Force from all 11 countries involved and to express my sympathy for the losses they have suffered. It is essential that all of the parties concerned extend to UNIFIL their full and unconditional cooperation.\n178.\tElsewhere in the Middle East, war continues between Iran and Iraq and no end seems to be in sight despite the efforts of several mediation missions. There are also continuing conflicts in central and southern Asia, in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea.\n179.\tThe past 18 months have brought great suffering to the Afghan people, large numbers of whom have been forced into exile in neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan. The crisis not only affects the country itself but also imposes severe difficulties in neighboring States and threatens both regional stability and international peace. My Government believes that any settlement must necessarily provide for the withdrawal of foreign troops and the creation of conditions in which the people of Afghanistan can determine their own form of government, free from outside intervention. The initiative of the European Community offers a reasonable means of advancing towards a negotiated settlement and of returning Afghanistan to its traditional independent and nonaligned status.\n180.\tThe people of Kampuchea too have undergone appalling suffering over recent years as a result of domestic cruelties and the hardships imposed by foreign invasion and occupation. Here too we believe that a comprehensive political settlement is needed. This should lead to an independent Kampuchea, whose people would be free to select the Government of their choice. In our view, Kampuchea should be free from any foreign military presence, it should maintain friendly relations with all the countries of the region and it should have the benefit of international assistance for reconstruction. We hope that Viet Nam and other nations whose cooperation is essential for arriving at a peaceful solution may soon agree to join with others in the international community to discuss a settlement on the lines I have indicated.\n181.\tThe right of every people to freedom from outside intervention applies too to Poland, a country for whose people we in Ireland have a special regard. We believe that, in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Final Act of Helsinki, it is for the Polish people themselves to determine their own future without the threat of any intervention in their internal affairs.\n182.\tI have spoken here of a series of world problems and the approach which my Government takes to them. I feel it right at the end of this statement to refer to a problem nearer home, that of Northern Ireland. I want to inform the world Assembly of the approach of the new Irish Government to that issue.\n183.\tIn the past 10 years violence in Northern Ireland has led to the deaths of 2,150 persons. This year alone deaths due to political violence have already reached a figure of 85. For a community of only one and a half million people these figures reflect much suffering and very serious community diversions. What is the origin of this tragic situation?\n184.\tAs it moved to independence just over 60 years ago, Ireland was divided. A long and complex history had left a minority in the northeastern corner of the island who favored the existing union with Great Britain and were not prepared to join the majority in independence. So Northern Ireland was created and remained within the United Kingdom. Within this area, the Unionists, who were a minority in the island, now became a local majority. There was also a substantial minority who strongly opposed this settlement, which had made them a minority within Northern Ireland, and who aspired to a reunification of the whole island of Ireland. The result ever since has been a divided community in Northern Ireland, where political identity and loyalty has always been the basic issue in democratic elections and where violence has flared up at frequent intervals.\n185.\tHistorians may argue whether the problem of Northern Ireland was in its origin a colonial one. My Government does not approach the issue in this way. Nor do we see it as a matter of disputed territory or a claim of some kind by the Government and the people of the south on Northern Ireland. The central issue for all of us in Ireland today is peace, not peace in the sense merely of an end to violence although that of course is vital but peace in the wider sense of reconciliation and of healing.\n186.\tThis is necessarily a broad and general aim to which many would subscribe. The question is how to bring it about. What policies, what efforts and what changes will be needed? What future political structures will be necessary within Northern Ireland, between north and south in the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Great Britain, two countries which have been linked so closely and for so long? And how are the extremists of whatever political outlook whose recourse to violence opens new wounds instead of promoting healing and reconciliation to be dealt with? These are difficult questions, and they preoccupy my Government.\n187.\tWhat I can do here is indicate very clearly the direction my Government will try to take and the principles we will try to follow.\n188.\tFirst, as I said, our primary aim is peace, healing and reconciliation. It follows that we utterly repudiate violence, because violence in such a situation not only causes human suffering, but also keeps open old bitterness and cruelly opens new wounds.\n189.\tSecondly, the claim by the men of violence to derive legitimacy from the past or from the future for acts of violence in Ireland today is a spurious one. By their actions those who make this claim are replacing the dream of Irish unity by a nightmare of violence and discord. The freedom won by the people of Ireland with much difficulty in the past was the freedom for each generation of people living in Ireland to choose the type of society they want for themselves and for their children. No Irish Government will allow that freedom of choice to be usurped.\n190.\tThirdly, my Government is open in its outlook and approach. It is ready to examine, to consider and, if major change is needed, to propose to our electorate whatever may best advance our basic aim of healing and reconciliation in Ireland.\n191.\tFourthly, to this end, too, we will do what we can to promote good will and understanding through dialog across the community divisions in Northern Ireland and also between north and south in the island of Ireland.\n192.\tFifthly, we want to do all this within a framework which gives expression to and further promotes the many close links between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.\n193.\tUnfortunately, for many months now an immediate and pressing issue the hunger strike by prisoners in Northern Ireland has diverted attention and energy from those broader aims. That issue, related as it is to prison conditions in Northern Ireland and to the status to be accorded in prison to those who have been convicted of violence, has attracted worldwide attention. It is natural that it should do so. Self-sacrifice, particularly through a long drawn-out hunger strike, testifies to deep conviction, and it arouses human emotions of sympathy and concern for those who are prepared to accept such a long and slow death. It is thus a weapon of great power. But it is a weapon; and in Northern Ireland it is a weapon which has been used with great determination by organizations and people who themselves have shown the most ruthless lack of concern for human suffering. In the words of the Irish poet Yeats: \\\"Too long a sacrifice makes a stone of the heart.\\\" The hunger strike and its needless prolongation have made a stone of many hearts in Northern Ireland today.\n194.\tSince it began in early 1981, 10 persons have died on hunger strike. But in that same period some 64 other persons have died by violence in the area, 40 of them struck down without mercy by those very organizations which seek to mobilize support and humanitarian concern around the world for their own members who are serving prison sentences in Northern Ireland for earlier acts of violence.\n195.\tMy Government has deep sympathy for all who suffer in Northern Ireland. No one of compassion could be indifferent in human terms to each successive death as it occurs. But what is one to say of those who encourage and use the long drawn-out and widely publicized death of a young hunger striker to call for human rights while they themselves are meting out death most cruelly and without compassion to those whom they choose to see as opponents of'Irish unity. For our part, the Irish Government, speaking for the great majority of the Irish people, wants to see an end to killing, to violence of all kinds and to the voluntary sacrifice of lives used as a weapon in a campaign of violence. We want this for humanitarian reasons but also because we know that the hunger strike is a weapon to gain support for those who use violence and we want to see that weapon defused and disarmed.\n196.\tThere have been times in recent months when it seemed to us that the hunger strike could have been brought to an end without any concession of principle, that is, without conceding so-called political status, if the prison authorities were to make changes in certain limited respects in the rules under which the prisoners are held, while continuing to ensure, as they must, the good governance of the prison system as a whole. My Government, in its continuing contacts with the British Government, has sought to encourage it to consider whether any such measure might be open to it and could be introduced without concession on basic principle. Our hope was that lives could be saved in prison and outside and that the weapon of the hunger strike would thereby be blunted and defused. We believe that some such changes are possible without yielding on principle, and we hope that, they will be made by the British Government in View of its particular responsibilities. But I want to emphasize here also the responsibility for an end to this stubborn confrontation on the part of those members of paramilitary bodies who have organized it and sought thereby to mobilize support for their campaign of violence.\n197.\tMany public figures in Ireland in both the political and religious life of the country have called insistently for an end to the hunger strike and an end to the campaign of violence. Those calls simply must be heeded. I want to echo and amplify them in the Assembly. The hunger strike and the campaign of violence with which it is closely linked are tragic and ultimately futile diversions from an aim which most Irish people share that of bringing healing and reconciliation to the island of Ireland and lifting the burden of history from the shoulders of all its people.\n198.\tI began my statement here today by referring to the sombre international climate and the need to do what we can at this session of the Assembly to improve it, to lessen tensions and to ease conflicts. That is our aim too in Ireland. I have tried to explain to representatives the approach that we are taking, and I ask for their support and understanding for what we are trying to do. I hope that by the time I come to speak to the Assembly next year I will be able to report progress and that I may be able to talk to representatives of real movement towards peace and reconciliation in Ireland.\n199.\tIn summary, we in Ireland seek peace in the world through the instrumentality of the United Nations; we seek peace in the many trouble spots of the world through the United Nations and other international agencies; and we seek peace in our own small island through the same principles of justice and mutual understanding that form the basis of the work of the United Nations.\n"

It is also an honor bestowed on his country, Iraq, with which we have fraternal ties and relations and a common heritage. We are fully convinced that his outstanding abilities will permit him to conduct the proceedings of this session to a positive and successful conclusion.\n169.\tMoreover, I wish to congratulate and pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar; for his skill and great ability in steering the proceedings of the thirty-fifth session.

That question still poses a grave threat to International peace and, security. That menace has worsened still more since we met here last year This is the natural result of the intransigence and conceit that characterize Israeli policy and conduct, as well as to Israel's persistence in flouting the resolutions and instruments of international bodies and the , demands of international public opinion, which each day increases its support for Arab lights, especially the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n172.\tIsrael's flouting of international public opinion is increasing ad infinitum and ad nauseam. We cannot sit idly by and condone its behavior; its intransigent conduct heightens the tension in the area and diminishes the possibility of reaching a durable and just solution to the question. Moreover, Israel's contempt for the numerous resolutions adopted by the Organization and other international forums naturally obstructs those forums from working to better conditions in the area and reduces the possibility that those forums could carry out the role of maintaining peace based on justice, to which we all aspire.\n173. The claims of the leaders and officials of Israel are well known, even if they are sometimes disguised as peaceful solutions. In the past, some States believed In these Israeli claims. Then, ample evidence of the falseness of their declared desire for peace was given in in form of expansionist and aggressive Israeli policies and practices, Israel's declaration of its annexation of the Holy City of Jerusalem and its consideration of that place as its eternal capital, as well as its efforts to change the city's character and demography, and its oppressive policies directed against the Palestinian people and the creation of settlements on Palestinian and Arab lands.\n174. We have mentioned before, and we wish n repeat here, that there cannot be durable and just peace in the Middle East unless there is a complete withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, and unless Israel restores the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Those rights have been affirmed through resolutions of the United Nations and the Islamic Conference, as well as by the non-aligned countries.\n175.\tProceeding from that premise, my delegation wishes to state its full support for the principles governing a solution of the Middle East problem which are contained in the statement by Crown Prince Fahd ibn Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia. The elements and details of that statement are identical to the just principles adopted by the Assembly and they therefore offer a sound basis for solving that problem.\n176.\tThe repeated acts of aggression by Israel against fraternal Lebanon, which reached their height recently, threaten to make the strained situation there explode and result in i.-e outbreak of a generalized war in the Middle East. My country, condemning the terrorism practiced by the Israeli authorities against the fraternal Lebanese people and the Palestinian camps, in spite of numerous resolutions adopted by the Security Council calling for the Lebanese Government to be allowed to re-establish its authority and full sovereignty over the whole of Lebanon, calls on the international community to stand firm against those acts of aggression in order that peace and stability may be restored to fraternal Lebanon.\n177.\tIsraeli aircraft destroyed the Iraqi nuclear research centre in a flagrant violation of established international legal norms and the Charter of the United Nations. We have to recall here that Iraq is a party to the treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which stipulates that all nuclear activities should be under the control of IAEA, which has testified that Iraq has implemented all its commitments and guarantees in accordance with the treaty.\n178.\tThat act of Israeli aggression against fraternal Iraq constitutes a serious and new development that can only make the situation in the area worse. In addition, it is a flagrant violation of the legitimate rights of the developing countries to develop their programs of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, with a view to advancing their economy and industries in accordance with their present and future needs. My delegation calls for the implementation of Security Council resolution 487 (1981), which stipulated, inter alia, the right of Iraq to appropriate compensation for the destruction its nuclear installations suffered as a result of the wanton, criminal Israeli act of aggression.\n179.\tThe continuing war in our area between two neighbors, the fraternal countries of Iraq and Iran, constitutes a source of grave concern for us. This is the second year of the war and there has been no success In the efforts, either of the Organization, of the non-aligned countries or of the Islamic Conference, to put an end to it. The Sultanate of Oman supports the efforts that are being exerted and hopes that peace and tranquility will be restored to those two countries as soon as possible. The continuation of that war, in addition to being a source of great human and economic waste, represents one of the gravest hotbeds of tension threatening security and stability in our area and in the world.\n180.\tThis year six Gulf States, among them the Sultanate of Oman, crowned their tireless efforts at co-operation with the creation of a Gulf Co-operation Council, the statutes of which were signed on 26 May 1981, at Abu Dhabi.\n181.\tOne of the most important objectives of that Council is to co-ordinate the activities of the countries involved in order to ensure economic welfare and social prosperity, as well as political stability and security for their peoples, in order to work actively and to have a more positive impact on events, whether those directly linked to the States members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, or to those that are interested in those events as Members of the United Nations who do not wish to. involve the latter Organization in international strife.\n182.\tThe Gulf Co-operation Council is inspired by the collective co-operation called for by the League of Arab States. It is therefore in keeping with the main objectives of the United Nations Charter, which is based on the realization of international peace and security through regional co-operation.\n183.\tThe Sultanate of Oman, as a member of that Council, affirms that it is not a military alliance against any quarter, nor is it a new political axis. That Council has been created, as we have mentioned before, to organize the co-ordination and co-operation of peoples with common aspirations. The Council will lend strong support to all the issues defended by States which cherish peace and justice.\n184.\tSince troops from the Soviet Union ravaged the territory of non-aligned Afghanistan at the end of 1979, cries have been heard from the international community daily, denouncing and deploring that armed invasion. United Nations resolutions and those of other international organizations called on the Soviet Union to withdraw immediately from Afghanistan, and reaffirmed the right of the Afghan people to choose its own form of Government and to determine its economic, political and social system without any outside interference, and without any coercion or pressure. However, despite all that, the situation in Afghanistan has remained the same, for the Soviet Union has rejected all these calls and resolutions, the most recent of which was the initiative of the European Community aimed at solving the Afghan problem.' That initiative also contained positive elements which would have made it possible to put an end to the crisis. My delegation calls on the Organization and on all peace-loving countries to devote their efforts towards ensuring the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and creating the necessary conditions to enabling the Afghan refugees to return to their homeland in security and dignity.\n185.\tThe position of principle of my country concerning its support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and its interest in implementing that Declaration, which has been adopted by the Organization, has led it to participate actively in the meetings that were convened for this purpose.\n186.\tMy country has noted with regret that the first and second sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, held this year to undertake the preparation of the Indian Ocean conference which is scheduled to be held at Colombo, have not thus far led to any positive results. The views of the members of the Committee have not yet been reconciled regarding either the political and security climate in the area or the formalization of the date of the conference. In view of the heightened tension in this area, which is a vitally important one, my country attaches paramount importance to the convening of the Colombo conference at the earliest possible moment. In the mean time, Oman hopes that the obstacles that have obstructed holding the conference will soon be eliminated.\n187.\tThere are other areas of our troubled world where the situation is still very serious, and where all our attention will be required to solve problems involved. If we look for the root causes of the strained and deteriorating conditions prevailing in these areas, we shall find that most of the causes are linked to non-compliance with the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of others and respect for the sovereignty and independence of States.\n188.\tThe situation in Kampuchea is still the same. The armed foreign intervention still continues, the foreign troops in Kampuchea have not yet been withdrawn and the economic, social and humanitarian problems that have resulted from this situation are becoming even more acute. The situation requires the adoption of urgent measures. Since my delegation supported the initiative of the United Nations to hold an international conference on Kampuchea, it deplores and deeply regrets the refusal of the Government of Viet Nam to attend this important conference. This is a challenge to the resolution of the General Assembly on the subject [resolution 3516]. My delegation also regrets that one of the five permanent members of the Security Council boycotted that Conference and declined to respond to the United Nations initiative designed to achieve a solution that would eliminate the crisis and put an end to the tragedy of the Kampuchean people.\n189.\tThe Sultanate of Oman participated in the International Conference on Kampuchea. This reflected its observance of the resolutions of the United Nations and its application of them in its foreign policy, which Is based on the rejection of any form of interference in the internal affairs of countries and on respect for the national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity'oT all States.\n190.\tThe Sultanate of Oman hopes to see a just solution to the problem of the reunification of Korea by peaceful means, through negotiations. We welcome international efforts, especially those of the United Nations, aimed at solving this problem, and hope that such efforts will continue. We maintain that the participation of the two Korean States in the work of our Organization will no doubt contribute to the attainment of the desired peaceful Solution.\n191.\tIn the African continent, with which my country has historical links, we note that the situation in its southern part is still tense. The suffering caused by racial discrimination is felt everywhere there. We also observe attempts at foreign intervention in many regions, including the Horn of Africa and Chad, to mention only two. My country denounces racism, neo-colonialism and attempts to interfere in the affairs of the African continent. It calls for intensified efforts in the United Nations to put an end to these tendencies so that the desire of the African peoples for freedom and stability can be realized. We also hope that the initiative of the five Western Powers will be resumed so that a peaceful and just solution for the Namibian problem may be found.\n192.\tThe centers of crisis, especially in the Asian and African continents, have resulted in a large number Of refugees. The deterioration of this situation constitutes an urgent humanitarian problem which requires the exertion of more international effort in order to find lasting solutions to it. The situation also requires supplementary social and humanitarian efforts to relieve the suffering of the huge numbers of refugees.\n193.\tMy country, while appreciating the importance of measures to relieve the plight of Refugees, Wishes to reaffirm its call for co-cooperation in order to avoid new flows of refugees. In this connection it Is relevant to refer to the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa, which was held successfully at Geneva last April. The Sultanate of Oman participated in this Conference and contributed within its means to dealing with the problem posed by the tremendous flow of refugees to certain countries in the African continent.\n194; The Third United Nations Development Decide started last January. In resolution 35/56 we adopted, at the thirty-fifth session, the International Development Strategy for the new Development Decade, which is part and parcel of the continuing efforts of the international community to accelerate progress in the developing countries, and to establish a new international economic order that would eliminate all inequity and imbalance prevailing in present international economic relations, which has widened the gap between developed and developing countries. Moreover, this imbalance and inequity represent obstacles to the development efforts of the developing countries, and prejudice international relations and the process of strengthening peace and security in the world.\n195. The response of the industrialized world to the requirements of the developing countries is a necessary and urgent matter, If adequate measures: are not taken, the harmful effects will continue, to the detriment of the development programs of the developing countries. Furthermore, the developed countries should not surmount\ntheir own economic problems at the expense of the developing countries. Such a situation causes imbalance, inequalities and instability In the economies ,of the. developing countries.\n196. Constant fluctuations in the prices of raw materials Impose strong constraints on the development efforts of the developing countries. As a developing country, Oman is also greatly affected by the negative aspects of the present international economic order. We hope that the ongoing negotiations and efforts will result in fruitful solutions to the economic problems of the developing countries.\n197.\tDespite the problems and constraints caused by the deteriorating economic situation in the world, the efforts of my country in the field of development and of building a modern Oman are still continuing. This year we have started to implement the second five-year plan in the Sultanate of Oman, covering the period front 1981 to 1985, following the successful, implementation of the first five-year plan. Those efforts resulted in a large growth in the exploitation of industrial resources and the five-year plan which we have just started is considered as a continuation and expansion of efforts to ensure economic development. That plan is especially concerned with the sectors of irrigation, agriculture and fishing. It will also give a strong momentum to the private sector in addition, the plan has adopted an expanded program to provide facilities and services throughout the country, with particular attention to the various regions of the Sultanate of Oman which have special geographical characteristics.\n198.\tWe  had great hopes that the tenth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea would be the last session. Instead, we find ourselves today in a situation in which we an asked to review the delicate balance that we had arrived, at through arduous efforts, lasting more than 40 years.\n199.\tThe determination of certain countries who do not want coastal countries to be able to exercise sovereignty over their territorial waters was a source of surprise to my delegation. It is completely illogical that any comprehensive International convention on the law of the sea should 'neglect one of the most important principles of international law, namely, the sovereignty of a State over its territorial waters, which is considered an extension of its sovereignty over its land.\n200.\tMy country firmly adheres to the right of the coastal State to require notification or prior authorization for the passage of military ships through its territorial waters, including through straits used for international navigation.\n201.\tMy delegation also hopes that agreement will be reached soon on the outstanding issues. We hope that the spring session, which is scheduled to be held in New\nYork next year; will be the last and definitive session, and that the States may be able to sign the long awaited convention at Caracas before the end of 1982.\n202.\tIn concluding my statement, I wish to-confirm that the delegation of Oman will give its co-operation to the President throughout this session. We hope that the goals to which the session aspires will be achieved.\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept my congratulations, Sir, on your election to the high position of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that your great personal experience of the work of the United Nations will ensure the success of this session.\n54.\tThe Mongolian delegation welcomes the admission to membership in the United Nations of Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu and wishes the peoples of these countries every success in strengthening their freedom, independence and economic development.\n55.\tThe world has entered the penultimate decade of the twentieth century, which is characterized by the steady growth of the forces of peace, democracy and socialism. The year 1981 is rich in events of special significance for our country. The Mongolian people has solemnly celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the foundation of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the sixtieth anniversary of the victory of the people's revolution, which ushered in an era of national renaissance, progress and prosperity in its history. In March of this memorable year a citizen of the Mongolian People's Republic, J. Gurragcha, took part as a member of the SovietMongolian crew in the flight into outer space of the spacecraft Soyuz 39.\n56.\tFundamental transformations have taken place in Mongolia in this historically short span. Our society has traversed from medieval feudalism to socialism, bypassing a whole stage of social development capitalism. Today, the Mongolian People's Republic has become a socialist State with a dynamically developing economy, a, flourishing culture and a steadily rising standard of living of the population.\n57.\tToday our people, relying on the disinterested aid and close cooperation with the countries of the socialist community, is striving to achieve the objective of completing the construction of the material and technical base of socialism.\n58.\tThe General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, President of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic, Yu Tsedenbal, in his report to the eighteenth Congress of the Party set forth the following tasks for foreign policy activities in the strengthening of peace:\n\\\"Actively and consistently to pursue the policy of consolidating detente and improving the international situation; to promote in every way the implementation of the peace initiatives advanced by the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as a follow-up to the Peace program; to support the efforts of peace-loving States to curb the arms race and to adopt effective measures in the field of military detente and disarmament; to contribute within the framework of the United Nations and other international organizations to efforts aimed at finding constructive solutions to the pressing problems of today; to contribute in every way to strengthening peace and security in Asia through the joint efforts of Asian States; to work for a further expansion of political dialog and equal cooperation in various fields with the countries of Asia.\\\"\n59.\tThe present international situation makes it incumbent upon all peace-loving States to set as their main objective the strengthening of peace and universal security. In 1981 the world community is witnessing growing international tension. The reason for such a negative turn of events lies in the intensifying intrigues of those in the most aggressive circles of imperialism, with the direct connivance of the Maoist leadership of China. These forces pursue the adventuristic objective of checking the world's social progress. Such a course represents an attempt to deny the right of nations to peace, national independence and social progress. It also represents a flagrant infringement of the right of newly independent countries to equitable and just international cooperation and to dispose freely of their national wealth and resources.\n60.\tThe ever intensifying campaigns in the West against the mythical \\\"Soviet military threat\\\" or \\\"international terrorism\\\" are intended to justify aggressive actions not only against real socialism and the forces of national and social liberation, but they also serve as a cover for an offensive against all that is just, democratic and progressive, a cover for attempts to export counterrevolution. This policy, which is utterly divorced from reality and aspires to achieve the unattainable, is fraught with adventurism. The international community should be well aware of all this.\n61.\tThat militarist and expansionist policy finds its material expression in the measures undertaken by the United States Administration and in the ruling circles of leading members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to secure military and strategic superiority over the world socialist community. Today the world is witnessing an unprecedented arms race and the implementation of a wide-ranging program to create new generations of strategic weapons as well as a whole system of nuclear and conventional weapons. New types of chemical and bacteriological weapons have been developed. A decision has been taken to deploy American medium range nuclear missiles in Western Europe. The United States has announced a decision to proceed to full-scale production of the neutron weapon. In that country too a scheme for the militarization of outer space is being hatched.\n62.\tImperialist military bases are being expanded and, in addition, \\\"rapid deployment forces\\\" are being created for the purpose of intervening in various parts of the world.\n63.\tThe United States refuses to ratify the SALT II treaty and evades negotiations on the vital issues of curbing the arms race and disarmament, particularly in the field of limiting nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction. The danger to mankind of such war preparations is further aggravated by the United States campaign to brainwash public opinion so as to make it susceptible to the idea of the admissibility of so-called limited nuclear war and the possibility of surviving such a war. In aspiring to world leadership, the United States has taken to arbitrarily declaring various regions of the world as spheres of its \\\"vital interest\\\", that is, turning them into targets of direct interference and armed intervention. Intrinsically connected with this is the United States military and economic support for reactionary regimes in the Middle East, South and SouthEast Asia, Latin America, southern Africa and so on. The undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the bellicose intrigues against the People's Republic of Kampuchea, carried out jointly by Washington and Peking, are part and parcel of the same policy.\n64.\tIn the face of the policy of diktat and aggression, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries advance their peaceful initiatives worked out at the congresses of the communist and workers' parties of these countries recently. In particular, the Peace program for the 1980s put forward by the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union contains a whole set of constructive and realistic proposals on the key issues of improving the international situation and preventing the threat of war.\n65.\tThe socialist countries propose peaceful dialog and constructive negotiations on the basis of the principles of equality and equal security as the only sensible way of settling international problems. dialog helps to strengthen trust and mutual understanding among States, ease tensions, preserve detente and eliminate conflict and crisis situations.\n66.\tIn this connection, the Mongolian delegation underscores the special significance of an improvement in the relations between the two major Powers with differing social systems the Soviet Union and the United States. We believe that constructive meetings of representatives of these countries at all levels, including the highest, as was proposed by the Soviet Union, will have a decisive impact on improving the international climate and will serve the longterm interests of strengthening universal peace and security. It is in this light that the delegation of the\nMongolian People's Republic views the significance of the meetings recently held between the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union and the Secretary of State of the United States. The agreement to begin negotiations this 30 November on the problems of limiting medium range nuclear missile weapons in Europe cannot but meet with the approval of the international community.\n67.\tImplementation of the proposal by the Soviet Union to hold meetings of the Security Council with the participation of the top leaders of the States members of the Council  and other interested countries would in fact represent multilateral negotiations at the highest level on vital issues concerning the strengthening of universal peace and security. Given a positive stand on all sides, especially the permanent members of the Security Council, such meetings could yield far-reaching favorable results.\n68.\tNaturally, the main thrust of the initiatives of the socialist countries is aimed at the adoption of measures to halt the arms race and achieve disarmament especially nuclear disarmament. The approach of the socialist countries in this field is based on maintaining the existing global military and strategic parity and then lowering the levels of arsenals of States in strict compliance with the security interests of all countries. Regrettably, because of the negative position of the United States and some other nuclear weapon Powers, up to now there has been a conspicuous lack of proper consideration of such important proposals of the socialist countries as the cessation of production of all types of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of their stockpiles until they have been completely destroyed, prohibition of the creation of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction, and so on.\n69.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers particularly important the resumption of the negotiations on limiting strategic armaments together with the preservation of what has been achieved so far. In connection with the forthcoming negotiations on medium range nuclear missile weapons, my delegation reiterates its Government's high appreciation of the proposal by the Soviet Union to reach an agreement on setting a moratorium both quantitative and qualitative on the deployment in Europe of new medium- range nuclear missile weapons by the NATO countries and the Soviet Union, including the United States forward-based nuclear weapons in that region. Such an agreement would create conditions favorable to negotiations on lessening military confrontations in Europe, which has a direct bearing on the world situation in general. It would  also facilitate settlement of the question of convening a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe and the achievement of tangible results in the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe.\n70.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, as one of the sponsors of the draft convention on the prohibition of the production, stockpiling, deployment and use of neutron weapons, submitted for the consideration of the Committee on Disarmament as far back as 1978, favors the immediate resumption of negotiations on this urgent problem. In its statement to the Committee on 20 August 19814 it condemned the decision of the United States on the full-scale production of neutron weapons and demanded that Washington stop production of this most inhumane type of weapon of mass destruction.\n71.\tMongolia advocates completion, prior to the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament, of the work on drafting a convention on the prohibition of radiological weapons.\n72.\tSuccess in the work of the second special session on disarmament, to be held in the first half of 1982,. would be particularly significant, as it would give further impetus to the talks on vital issues concerning ending the arms race and on disarmament. At that session the Assembly is called upon to reaffirm and develop the achievements of the first special session on disarmament, held in 1978, and to become an important step towards the convening of a world disarmament conference which could adopt binding decisions on urgent disarmament issues. The Mongolian People's Republic, as a member of the preparatory committee for the second special session, will continue actively to promote the success of its work.\n73.\tIn view of the fact that the danger of the militarization of outer space is at present becoming evident, the proposal by the Soviet Union for the conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of stationing weapons of any kind in this new area of human activity [A/36/192, annex] is most timely. Implementation of that proposal would strengthen the existing international legal instruments aimed at safeguarding outer space from becoming an arena of the arms race. In our view, it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to recommend to the Committee on Disarmament that it embark as soon as possible on the drafting of a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space, on the basis of the draft submitted by the Soviet Union.\n74.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic fully supports the highly important proposal of the Soviet Union on the adoption by the General Assembly at the present session of a declaration on the prevention of a nuclear catastrophe. The requirements of the present moment are aptly met by the proposal [A/36/241], which condemns the first use of nuclear weapons as the gravest crime against humanity, and any doctrines allowing the first use of nuclear weapons as incompatible with human moral standards and the lofty ideals of the United Nations. My delegation considers highly relevant the provisions of the draft declaration on the supreme duty and direct responsibility of the leaders of nuclear-weapon States to act in such a way as to eliminate the danger of an outbreak of a nuclear conflict. The adoption by the General Assembly of the declaration would be the most important measure meeting the aspirations of the people of the world to prevent the threat of nuclear war and would considerably strengthen the security of all countries, particularly the nonnuclear States. My delegation considers that it is the duty of the General Assembly in accordance with its obligations flowing from the principles and purposes of the. United Nations Charter to adopt' the proposed declaration.\n75.\tThe situation in the Asian continent gives rise to serious anxiety. The forces of imperialism, hegemonism and militarism are intensifying their intrigues against the peace and independence of the peoples of Asia. The expansion of the military political collaboration between the United States and China and the decision of the United States Administration to supply the latter with modern weapons, military techniques and technology constitute a particularly dangerous development. The increasingly obvious involvement of Japan in the military political partnership of the United States and China adversely affects the international situation.\n76.\tThe situation in SouthEast Asia has deteriorated as a result of the intrigues of the aggressive and expansionist forces unwilling to recognize new realities and the steady consolidation of the people's democratic system in Kampuchea. Attempts are being unceasingly made to restore the regime rejected by the people of Kampuchea and to this end to bring together various groupings of traitors to the interests of their own people. The convening of the so-called International Conference on Kampuchea despite the objections of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and broad international public opinion can only be qualified as a flagrant interference in the internal affairs of that sovereign State. The decisions of the so called Conference have no legal force. They only play into the hands of those who obstruct the efforts to normalize the situation in SouthEast Asia and run counter to the genuine interests of peace and stability of all countries in the region without exception. Assigning the seat of Kampuchea in the United Nations to persons who have on their conscience the lives of millions of Kampucheans undermines the prestige and authority of the United Nations.\n77.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the well-known proposals put forward by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea to turn SouthEast Asia into a zone of peace, stability and cooperation. The Mongolian delegation holds that the new initiatives set forth in the memorandum of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Lao People's Democratic Republic of 28 September 1981 [A/36/561] represent a further development of the proposals of the three countries of IndoChina on the normalization of the situation in the region and can serve as a constructive basis for the achievement of that important objective.\n78.\tThe intensification on the aggressive designs and bellicose intrigues by the hegemonist forces and their accomplices against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the unbridled campaign waged around the nonexistent \\\"Afghan problem\\\" increasingly aggravate the situation in this region of Asia.\n79.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic favors a political settlement of the situation arising around Afghanistan. The constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan set forth in its statement of 24 August 1981 [A/36/457] open up the possibility of a positive solution of the problem and the establishment of peace and good neighborly relations in that region. The new initiatives of the Soviet Union on ways to ensure peace and security in the Persian Gulf area are making a contribution along the same lines. The Mongolian People's Republic rejects the proposal of some Western Powers to convene an international conference on Afghanistan, without its participation, as a maneuver designed to make possible interference in the internal affairs of the Afghan people.\n80.\tOf grave concern is the situation in the Middle East, where the Camp David deals have led to a further escalation of tension, which is fraught with danger to peace in the region.\n81.\tThe barbaric raid by Israel on the nuclear research center in Iraq and its ceaseless aggressive actions in southern Lebanon have demonstrated anew the unruliness of Israel in its acts of aggression, which find full encouragement from the United States.\n82.\tAn international conference as proposed by the Soviet Union could serve as a most suitable forum in the search^ for ways and means to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem. A lasting and just peace in the Middle East can be ensured only on the basis of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied Arab territories and the exercise of the right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination, including the establishment of their own State.\n83.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic favors the speediest possible peaceful settlement of the IranIraq conflict. Further perpetuation of the conflict plays into the hands of imperialist forces which seek to restore their lost positions in the region.\n84.\tMy Government consistently supports the idea of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace and stands for the elimination of the military presence of imperialist Powers in this region. It advocates the convening of an international conference on the Indian Ocean without delay. The Mongolian People's Republic proceeds from the premise that zones of peace would serve as an effective means of strengthening international security and limiting the arms race in the respective regions of the world.\n85.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic continues to support the struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their country without outside interference. This requires above all the early implementation of the provisions of General Assembly resolution 3390 A (XXX), which anticipates the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Command and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the south of Korea.\n86.\tThe present complex situation in Asia urgently calls for concerted efforts to eliminate focal points of tension and to strengthen trust, mutual understanding and cooperation among the States of the continent. Guided by a sincere desire to facilitate the attainment of this vitally important objective, the Mongolian People's Republic has put forward a proposal [see A/36/388] for the elaboration and signature of a convention on mutual nonaggression and the nonuse of force in relations among the States of Asia and the Pacific, and for the convening to this end of a conference of States of those regions, to which the States permanent members of the Security Council would be invited.\n87.\tIn connection with that initiative, the Parliament of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Great People's Khural, made an appeal to the parliaments of Asian and Pacific countries which has been circulated as an official document of the General Assembly [ibid.]. The President of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural, Yu Tsedenbal, has sent a message to 50 heads of State or Government of the countries of those regions and to the States permanent members of the Security Council. These documents contain the reasons for our proposal, as well as some considerations on its practical implementation. The message from Comrade Yu Tsedenbal expresses our readiness to exchange views with interested countries at any level. We are confident that the elaboration and signing of a convention which proscribes the use of force in international relations would eliminate one 6f the major sources of tension and conflicts in a vast area of the earth Asia and the Pacific. We express the hope that the proposal will find support and understanding from the States of those regions and from all countries which cherish peace and security.\n88.\tI need hardly stress here that the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic is fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and has as its aim to contribute to the implementation of the provisions of a number of General Assembly resolutions on problems of strengthening international security and developing friendly relations among States. The initiative of the Mongolian People's Republic is intrinsically linked to the question of the conclusion of a world treaty on the non use of force in international relations, which is now under active consideration in the United Nations. It runs along the same lines as the Soviet initiative on the elaboration and application of confidence-building measures in the Ear East.\n89.\tThe attempts in imperialist circles to preserve the last vestiges of colonialism as their stronghold and to intensify their actions against the cause of national and social liberation under the pretext of combating \\\"international terrorism\\\" poison the international climate and impede full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)].\n90.\tThe eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, on Namibia, held at the beginning of this month emphasized anew the urgency of the* question of granting independence to the people of that country.\n91.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic strongly supports the struggle of the Namibian people for independence under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative, the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], and favors the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against the apartheid regime of Pretoria, which is occupying Namibia illegally. Having vetoed a decision of the Security Council on the application of sanctions, the United States has openly defied the peoples of Africa and the entire world community and has once more proved to be a supporter of the racist regime of South Africa.\n92.\tThe large-scale armed aggression against the People's Republic of Angola committed by Pretoria has clearly demonstrated the grave danger to the cause of peace and the national independence of the peoples of southern Africa represented by the collusion of imperialist and racist forces. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic and the .Mongolian people add their Strong voice to the demands for immediate withdrawal of the troops of the racist regime from those parts of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola occupied by them.\n93.\tThe Mongolian delegation shares the opinion of the SecretaryGeneral that \\\"in our time, international economic problems are inextricably linked with the maintenance of peace and stability ...\\\" [see A/36/1, sect. VI].\n94.\tThe policy of imperialist circles, seeking to perpetuate the old system of exploitation and diktat, adversely affects the world political climate and hampers the development of international cooperation directed at solving the global economic problems facing mankind. The socioeconomic situation of the developing countries, according to their main indexes, is deteriorating from year to year.\n95.\tThe straggle to establish a new international economic order free from exploitation and discrimination is an objective process. For the success of this struggle it is important to take properly into account the realities of the whole system of world economic relationships, in particular the increasing weight and progressive impact of the economic relations of the socialist countries. It is also necessary to consolidate the progressive provisions of the well-known General Assembly documents concerning the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. It should be added that lack of progress in reshaping international economic relations is rooted not in the forms or levels of negotiations but rather in the policy of the industrially developed capitalist countries.\n96.\tHowever complicated the present international situation may be, peace can be preserved. The increasing economic and defense potential of the socialist community  above all, that of the Soviet Union erects an insurmountable barrier to the adventurist actions of the enemies of peace and the national independence and social progress of peoples.\n97.\tThe role of the nonaligned movement, which recently marked its twentieth anniversary, has significantly increased as an important factor in the struggle for peace and international cooperation and against imperialist policies. The struggle of world public opinion to prevent the threat of war and for disarmament embraces the widest strata of people throughout the world.\n98.\tThe Mongolian delegation once again wishes to stress the need to combine the efforts of the United Nations with the struggle of world public opinion for peace and international cooperation. This serves as an important guarantee of effective action by the United Nations as an instrument for maintaining peace and international security.\n99.\tIn about a month it will be 20 years since the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations. The foreign policy of my Government during that period has been, as before, in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. My Government actively advocates the enhancing of the role and effectiveness of the world Organization as an important instrument for strengthening peace and developing equitable cooperation among nations.\n100.\tThe Mongolian delegation will, as before, spare no effort in contributing to the constructive work of the present session of the General Assembly in the interests of reducing international tensions and consolidating the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation.\n"

        "file_text": "92.\tMr. President, please accept the congratulations of the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR on your election to the responsible post of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and our wishes that energetic efforts should be made in the quest for constructive solutions for the sake of peace, international security and fruitful co-operation between peoples.\n93.\tAt the last session we noted with concern a marked complication of the international situation because of imperialist and hegemonic forces. At the same time, the forces of peace and progress, deeply conscious of their responsibility for the destinies of mankind, succeeded underlining in a number of General Assembly resolutions urgent measures for lessening the danger of war, curbing the arms race and solving vitally important problems through negotiations in the interests of peace and co-operation among peoples.\n94.\tRegrettably, it is still to be noted today that the international situation continues to remain extremely complicated and that it has even worsened in the past year. The true reasons for this are well known. Imperialist Powers, primarily the United States, deliberately heat up the international situation and continue their policy of confrontation with the world of socialism, try to achieve military superiority, feverishly whip up the arms race, which is unprecedented in its dimensions, while avoiding negotiations on disarmament, interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign States in a bid to subordinate them to their diktat and oppose the political settlement of conflicts and the elimination of hotbeds of tension. They are pursuing a policy of expanding the system of aggressive blocs, fighting national liberation movements, hampering the normal development of inter-State relations and trying to bury everything positive that was achieved in the 1970s in the field of detente.\n95.\tThe policy of the ruling circles of those States at the present time particularly blatantly demonstrates adventurism, and a readiness to risk the vital interests of mankind in the pursuit of their criminal designs. The closeness between imperialism and Beijing hegemonism is becoming ever more obvious. The military co-operation between the United States and China, with its far-reaching expansionist goals, is taking on tangible shape.\n96.\tIn this situation, the United Nations, which comprises practically all countries in the world, is called upon to concentrate its-efforts as never before on the implementation of the primary task proclaimed in its Charter: to save the present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\n97.\tComrade T. Y. Kiselev, Alternate Member of the Politbureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Byelorussian SSR, pointed out in his statement during the adoption of the appeal of the USSR Supreme Soviet to parliaments and peoples of the world that the conscience Of peoples cannot remain silent when the aggressive circles of imperialism, especially United States imperialism, whip up tensions, engage in gangster-like sabre-rattling and push the world towards a thermonuclear catastrophe. The time has come for all those who hold dear the cause of peace and progress to act immediately and persistently, for there is no international task that is more important today than that of safeguarding peace. We note with satisfaction that in the course of the general debate a unanimous and resolute \\\"no\\\" was given to the arguments espoused by certain people in Washington alleging that \\\"there are things more important than peace\\\".\n98.\tFor us, peace matters more than anything else. Peace-loving forces had to pay a very high price for the right to live in conditions of peace, for the opportunity to work peacefully and creatively for the benefit of their peoples in the interests of international economic cooperation. More than 20 million Soviet people, including every fourth Byelorussian inhabitant, perished in the scorching flames of the Second World War, which caused enormous suffering and misfortune.\n99.\tEveryone needs peace. War in the nuclear age is a calamity for all and is a direct threat to the existence of human civilization itself. What is needed is an active joint struggle against war and the forces which threaten to disrupt peace. The source of wars and of the arms race is generally known: it is the tycoons of the war business rather than peoples who make profits out of armaments and wars.\n100.\tUnswervingly following Lenin's behest that all our policy and propaganda are aimed at putting an end to war rather than dragging peoples into it, the Soviet State has made the struggle for peace and for the prevention of the threat of war and for curbing reactionary and militaristic forces the cornerstone, of its international activities. The policy of peace which flows from the social nature of the socialist system is the fundamental course adopted by Soviet foreign policy. It has found its expression in specific foreign policy actions and proposals advanced by the country of the Soviets in the international arena. That was once again convincingly demonstrated at the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which put forward a whole series of new sweeping initiatives aimed at preventing the threat of a nuclear war, curbing the arms race and strengthening international security. They deal both with nuclear missiles and conventional types of weapons as well as with land, naval and air forces. Those initiatives touch upon the situation in Europe and in the Near, Middle and Far East. They include the adoption of specific measures of both a political and a military nature.\n101.\tThose proposals constitute an organic continuation and a further development of the Soviet program of Peace adopted at the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the context of the most important contemporary problems. As Comrade Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, President of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, stressed \\\"It is not war preparations that doom the peoples to a senseless squandering of their material and spiritual wealth, but consolidation of peace that is the clue to the future\\\".\n102.\tThe Soviet program of Peace for the 1980s and specific proposals for its implementation, including those submitted at the present session of the General Assembly for its consideration, are imbued with concern for removing the threat of nuclear war that looms over the peoples, defusing tensions, preserving and extending detente, settling the most pressing international problems by peaceful means, halting and reversing the race in nuclear-missile and conventional arms and contributing to the development of peaceful co-operation between the States of all continents. Also proposed is the way to achieve those goals negotiations based on the principles of equality and equal security, without any preconditions or diktat and with careful consideration given to all constructive proposals put forward by other countries.\n103.\tThe general debate about to be concluded testifies to the fact that the majority of States share this approach. Yet forces which are against it are also active. This can be seen in their approach to any problem that the international community expects the United Nations to help resolve.\n104.\tAll States Members of the United Nations, even though they have their own specific interests, should be guided by the major commitments freely assumed under the Charter of the United Nations, that is, \\\"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security\\\". Yet, is everyone complying with the aforementioned requirements? No, unfortunately not. We see instances of irresponsibility, attempts by the ruling circles of some Western countries to build their relations with peace-loving States on the basis of hostility and the desire to unite the forces of aggression and reaction to undermine peace and the security of the peoples. All this is accompanied by disgraceful political blather about the hackneyed subject of the so-called Soviet military threat. Under its cover the United States has taken the decision to deploy 100 MX intercontinental ballistic missiles and to build 100 strategic bombers of the new B-l type. As a result of this, military expenditures by the United States will increase by over $180 billion.\n105.\tBesides, various malicious and fraudulent allegations are being turned out one after another, like for example the one contending that sometime, someone, somewhere in South-East Asia used toxic chemical substances said to be of Soviet manufacture. Yet what is known to be true is that the United States, in busily waging a hostile anti-Cuban campaign, is using biological weapons against it and is engaged in a new round of the chemical-weapons race, in particular, the binary system of warfare, and that the consequences of the large-scale use by the United States of the chemical means of warfare during its aggressive war in Viet Nam can still be felt.\n106.\tSome people are deliberately ignoring the indisputable fact, solemnly reaffirmed by the USSR Supreme Soviet in its appeal to parliaments and peoples of the world, that the Soviet Union is not threatening anyone, nor does it seek confrontation with any State, and that safeguarding peace has been, is and remains the highest goal of the foreign policy of the Soviet State.\n107.\tThe Soviet Union, the entire socialist community and the peace-loving forces of the planet press for the elimination of hotbeds of military conflicts and tensions and propose realistic ways of settling them and of preventing the emergence of new explosive crises. Also to be found among those proposals are initiatives by the USSR to expand confidence-building measures and the zone of their application in Europe, and to impose a moratorium on the deployment in Europe of new medium-range nuclear missiles and the United States forward based systems in that area.\n108.\tSo far there has been no positive response to those initiatives from the United States and a number of its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. In fact, the opposite is taking place, namely, the idea is being persistently impressed on Western Europe that the so-called dual decision does not in the least call for the entry into force of the SALT-II treaty on the limitation of strategic arms or for negotiations on all the aforementioned proposals, but that it merely envisages \\\"additional armament\\\" and the deployment of new United States medium-range nuclear systems, and now the neutron weapon as well, on the territories of some Western European countries contrary to the will of their peoples, who do not wish to live on top of a nuclear powder keg or close to it. Europe, which has received tangible benefits from the process of detente, is now being pushed towards the deterioration of relations with the socialist States, allegedly for the sake of \\\"NATO common interests\\\".\n109.\tIt is to be hoped that the Soviet-American agreement on the resumption of negotiations on the limitation of nuclear armaments in Europe, which we welcome, will help to overcome those unfavorable trends.\n110.\tIn the Middle East, stubborn attempts are still being made to push through the Camp David deal rejected and condemned in the United Nations. The Arab territories captured by Israel in 1967 have not been vacated, and the Arab people of Palestine is still being deprived of its inalienable right to create its own State. On an ever-growing scale, Israel is undertaking aggressive actions against Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, while the United States is taking Israel under American protection, even in the Security Council, and is entering into a \\\"strategic alliance\\\" with Israel, while fattening it up with what amounts annually to $5.5 billion of the American taxpayers' money.\n111.\tThe current situation makes especially timely the USSR proposal concerning an honest collective search for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem on a just and realistic basis within the framework of a specially convened international conference, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO].\n112.\tThe United States refuses to support the relevant proposals on normalizing the situation in the Persian Gulf area, on turning the Mediterranean into a zone of stable peace and co-operation or on establishing nuclear-free zones in the north of Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean. Those proposals are countered with the policy of an accelerated establishment of the \\\"rapid deployment force\\\" and military bases, the expansion of the NATO bloc and the desire to scrape together new aggressive alliances, some of them to include racist South Africa.\n113.\tIn Asia imperialists and hegemonists are pursuing a policy of stepping up tension and direct interference in the internal affairs of the countries of Indochina and continue to wage an undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In the United States statements are being made at the highest level about the intention to continue arming counter-revolutionary bands of mercenaries to be sent into Afghanistan. To that end arms which had been shipped to Egypt to help Israeli aggression are put up for resale.\n114.\tRegrettably, some participants in the hastily convened so-called \\\"Conference on Kampuchea\\\" in fact took their cue from the United States and China which are at-tempting to impose on the Kampuchean people bloodthirsty butchers who have been cursed and rejected by them and to keep those political corpses in the United Nations. Apparently, some people in those countries are deliberately forgetting or ignoring the fact that it is the United States and China which have turned down the idea of turning South-East Asia into a zone of peace, stability and co-operation and that it is the United States which has foiled the convening of a conference on making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace, refused to participate in the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa and opposed the positive conclusion of the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. They only need conferences that poison relations among States.\n115.\tWe vehemently reject the approach of imperialists and hegemonists to the problems of Asia, fraught as it is with the gravest consequences. A realistic approach to the settlement of problems in that area by peaceful political means has been outlined in the relevant proposals of Afghanistan [see A/36/457] and the countries of IndoChina [see A)'36/86, annex], the proposal of the USSR on the implementation of confidence-building measures in the Far East, the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic on the conclusion of a convention on mutual non- aggression and renunciation of force in relations among the States of Asia and of the Pacific and on the convening of a conference of States of that region [see A/36/388, annex] and the proposals of the Korean People's Democratic Republic on the peaceful solution of the Korean question, formulated by its President of the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n116.\tAny attempts to resolve questions related to the problems of Asia, which disregard the will of the peoples of the States concerned who have independently chosen the path of their development, and of their legitimate Governments, are doomed to failure.\n117.\tWe are convinced that joint constructive efforts by delegations to work out decisions designed to avert a nuclear catastrophe and to curb the arms race should occupy the central place in the work of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is obviously urgent for the General Assembly to adopt a declaration on the prevention of a nuclear catastrophe, a draft text of which was submitted at the current session by the Soviet Union [A!36/241, annex] and substantiated in the statement made at the 7th meeting by Comrade Andrei Gromyko, a member of the Politbureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR. The General Assembly .should clearly proclaim that \\\"States and statesmen who would be the first to use nuclear weapons would commit the gravest crime against humanity\\\" and that there would be no justification or pardon for them. Our duty is to do our utmost to eliminate the risk of a nuclear conflict emerging.\n118.\tA new impetus should also be given to the solution of questions relating to ending the nuclear arms race and reducing nuclear arms stockpiles until they are completely destroyed. Here, too, the process of negotiations to limit strategic offensive arms should be resumed as early as possible, while preserving the results already achieved in that field. Naturally, a reliable barrier should be established against the monstrous neutron weapon which threatens universal peace and the whole of mankind. That weapon can play the role of a fuse that could detonate a large-scale war. It dangerously lowers the so-called nuclear threshold; once it has crossed it mankind will find itself in the abyss of catastrophe. There is something sinister in the fact that that particularly barbaric weapon of the mass destruction of people which is meant to be used for seizing their material assets and natural resources received the blessing of Washington on the very day that the civilized world bowed to the memory of the victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. For Washington strategists who expatiate on the subject of the \\\"acceptability\\\" of a nuclear war and of \\\"limited\\\" nuclear wars to be waged on foreign soil, Hiroshima was not enough, they need \\\"Euroshima\\\"\u2014a Europe scorched by a fire-spitting tornado. And not only Europe it seems, for the neutron weapon may appear anywhere where there are United States military bases or rapid deployment forces, or in any area of the world which Washington would take it into its head to declare the sphere of \\\"vital interests of the United States\\\", even without the consent of the countries concerned.\n119.\tTales about the \\\"clean\\\" or \\\"humane\\\" nature of that weapon should mislead no one. We all remember how, using similar arguments, the United States went ahead with building up and improving its current nuclear potential.\n120.\tThe General Assembly should advance and should react positively to new important initiatives while making further efforts to achieve the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests, the strengthening of security guarantees of non-nuclear countries, the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territories of those States where there are none at present, the creation of nuclear-free zones, the consolidation of the nuclear- weapon non-proliferation regime and the prevention of their acquisition by South Africa, Israel, Pakistan and other countries, the prohibition of chemical and radiological weapons and of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction, the limitation of conventional weapons and the reduction of military expenditures, as well as coping with other tasks stemming from resolutions previously adopted, in the United Nations which are as yet unimplemented because of Western countries. We call on all delegations to support the proposal of the USSR entitled \\\"Conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space\\\" [A/36/192, annex] and thereby to complete steps already taken in the United Nations in order to rule out the possibility of using outer space as an arena for the arms race and for the aggravation of relations among States.\n121.\tThe elaboration and implementation of measures in the field of limiting the arms race and of disarmament should be linked inseparably with strengthening political, international and legal guarantees of the security of States. Of crucial importance here is the speedy elaboration and conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.\n122.\tIn the course of the general debate numerous figures have already been cited concerning the nefarious consequences of the arms race for the cause of peace and for the economic and social progress of peoples. It has been said, for instance, that in per capita terms there are more explosives than foodstuffs in the world. It may also be recalled that world expenditures on armaments in the post-Second World War period totaled more than $6,000 billion, a sum of IS times that of the gross national product of all developing countries taken together and that profits of United States monopolies from the sale of arms to African countries alone surpassed threefold the volume of United States economic aid to those States.\n123.\tAs military expenditures increase, inflation and unemployment increase, since military expenditures do not produce the goods needed for the market and create fewer jobs than would be the case if the same amount of money were invested in peaceful branches of the economy. Naturally the question arises: why does the United States step , up the arms race and force other countries to joint in it? There are numerous reasons, such as the desire to establish their diktat, military supremacy and world domination, and the need to solve its own economic problems at the expense of other countries. The militarization of the United States economy results in greater profits for the military-industrial complex and for those that deal in lethal weapons. The dragging of other States into the arms race not only ties them to the militaristic course pursued by United States foreign policy, to the detriment of their natural interests, but also lessens the prospects for the development of their peaceful-economies and sharply decreases the competitiveness of their goods on the world markets, which is to the advantage of United States business, already secure behind protectionist measures.\n124.\tAs Comrade Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev has pointed out, \\\"peace based on mutual intimidation is not attractive to us. We prefer peace in which the levels of armaments become lower and lower while the scale and quality of co operation in all fields grows and improves.\\\" That is the keynote of all the initiatives of the Soviet Union, including the proposals advanced at the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the creation of a competent international committee, composed of the most eminent scientists of different countries, which would demonstrate the vital need to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, and to convene-a special meeting of the Security Council at the highest level in order to look for ways of improving the international situation and preventing war.\n125.\tAlong with the other countries of the socialist community, the Byelorussian SSR consistently fights for the elimination of colonialism, racism and apartheid', actively supports the struggle of peoples for their national and social liberation; and opposes any attempts to suppress the will of peoples to self-determination and independence and to label liberation fighters \\\"terrorists\\\". Those who do so are also those who shamelessly equate national liberation struggles with terrorism, who overtly equip and send armed bands to subvert Governments supported by the peoples, who use mercenaries to suppress national liberation movements, who encourage aggressive actions by Israel against the Arab peoples as well as Pretoria's State terrorism and its aggression against Angola and other African countries, who shoot down aircraft in foreign air space, who stage political assassinations and provide assistance to odious dictatorial oppressive regimes, as is the case in Chile, El Salvador and some other countries.\n126.\tAs in the past, our delegation will actively contribute to the adoption, at the current session, of further steps aimed at ensuring the complete implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the plan of action adopted last year {resolution 35/118] to further its implementation with regard to Namibia as well as Micronesia or any other territory where imperialists, colonialists and racists hold sway.\n127.\tWe welcome the admission to membership in the United Nations of the Republic of Vanuatu and of Belize, which have freed themselves from colonial oppression. We wish their peoples every success on the road to independent development.\n128.\tNewly free independent States are facing the huge and difficult task of overcoming their economic backwardness, which can be done only in conditions of peace. Those countries can rely on our solidarity and support in their struggle for the elimination of all manifestations of inequality, diktat and exploitation in international economic relations and for the eventual initiation of global negotiations on the problems of economic development and mutually beneficial co-operation, which are currently blocked by imperialist forces. It is high time to take up the study of the problem of the outflow of financial resources from developing countries and to draw up measures for the protection of those States from the predatory activities of private foreign capital and especially the transnational corporation.\n129.\tThe States of the socialist community not only successfully resolve their economic and social problems in the interests of the working masses but also assist new independent countries in their economic development. Over the past decade the number of newly free countries receiving economic and technical assistance from the States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance has risen 62 to 90, and the amount of credits extended to them has increased by 110 per cent. During the same period 47,000 persons from developing countries were trained as highly skilled experts in educational establishments of the States of the socialist community. For instance, in the 1980-1981 school year alone, 3,419 foreign nationals studied in the Byelorussian SSR, including persons from 76 developing countries.\n130.\tWe shall have another opportunity to express our views on various items included in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. .\n131.\tIn conclusion, allow me to stress our readiness to support proposals designed to develop and deepen the political dialog between States, to resume suspended talks and to initiate new negotiations, both bilateral and multilateral, including negotiations at the highest level. These should be based on the principle of equality and equal security; they should not be conducted from a position of strength and military superiority. They should be aimed at achieving specific and positive results in the interests of the prevention of the danger of nuclear war, the strengthening of peace and international security, the triumph of the principle of the non-use of force in international relations, the curbing of the arms race and peaceful and mutually beneficial co-operation among peoples.\n132.\tWe call on all delegations to take such an approach, and we believe that compliance with the obligations stemming from the Charter and progressive United Nations decisions and our collective efforts will make it possible to adopt at this session decisions that will contribute to peace and progress on earth. We regard that as the primary role of the United Nations and as its principal responsibility to mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "143.\t I take particular pleasure, Sir, in congratulating you upon your election to the presidency of the thirty- sixth session of the General Assembly. In awarding you this high office, the Assembly has chosen a diplomat whose invaluable personal qualities, long experience and profound knowledge of the workings of the Organization will ensure the successful outcome of our work.\n144.\tI should also like to express once again my profound appreciation of the dedication, determination and efficiency with which your predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, carried out a most difficult task.\n145.\tI take this opportunity of extending cordial greetings to the delegation of Vanuatu. I recently had the pleasure of being host in Brussels to a mission from Vanuatu. My country looks forward to maintaining and developing the close ties which we established on that occasion.\n146.\tOn this very day Belize has joined the United Nations. I should like to extend to it our warm welcome. The alphabetical order will mean that our two delegations will be neighbors in most meetings, and we take pleasure in that.\n147.\tThe highest aspiration of human society is to organize its solidarity in justice and peace. The United Nations is the trustee of that aspiration, and the essential meaning of the general debate in the Assembly should be to gauge each year our achievements and to plan ahead. The General Assembly is the place for Governments to meet annually and examine their conscience. It should come as no surprise to find in this forum the contradictions and the doubts of all mankind.\n148.\tBeyond the diplomatic niceties and political constraints, serious reflection is necessary for us to see what we can really do to progress step by step toward the goal assigned to us.\n149.\tWhen we view the present state of the world it is all too easy to emphasize the injustices, the conflicts and the danger. The agenda of the current session is, in part, a catalog of the problems which endanger international relations. We have discussed many of these problems year after year without finding any satisfactory solutions.\n150.\tI shall speak on a single theme, that of peace, ,because my British colleague, Lord Carrington, on behalf of the 10 member States of the European Community, has already explained our views, our activities and our hopes concerning the main agenda items [8th meeting]. I need not cover all the points he has dealt with, for his speech was also that of Belgium. The very fact that the 10 member States of the European Community speak with one voice is in itself a concrete contribution to peace and to the transformation of a world of confrontation into a world of cooperation. We have here 10 countries of Europe, many of which for a century have repeatedly battled against each other and which, hardly 22 years after the First World War, were all caught up in another war which set the world aflame. Today, war between these countries of Western Europe has become unthinkable. What is more, they have embarked on building a genuine community. The results are not yet perfect, but they demonstrate that reason, a sustained will, a clear vision of the basic solidarity among peoples and the patient alignment of interests can overcome the age old curse. Starting from this example, I should like to consider practical ways which could ensure peace on a more stable basis, granting to all a real solidarity.\n151.\tArticle 1 of the Charter defines the purposes of the Organization. Foremost among these is the maintenance of international peace and security. Belgium, a victim throughout the centuries of the quarrels of its neighbors, has traditionally been particularly devoted to the search for peace. Few peoples have had as much experience as we have of the disasters of war and therefore also of the blessings of peace. But this experience has also freed us from simple illusions about ways to achieve and maintain peace.\n152.\tTaught by its past and conscious of its own particular situation, Belgium has entrusted its security to a regional defensive alliance, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, an alliance characterized by a high degree of permanent consultation among its members. Determined participation in this alliance enables my country to contribute fully to the difficult but essential dialog between East and West without which world peace would be no more than a precarious truce.\n153.\tWhen we view the problems of peace today, several facts stand out. In centuries past war was the ultimate instrument of international policy. When all ether methods became impossible, it was through war that the divergent views and interests and conflicting passions oilmen and Governments were finally resolved. Disputes found their solutions through war in ways that were often unjust but expedient. The threat hanging over everybody of destruction and misery encouraged compromises to some degree and often produced a period of stability of uncertain duration, characterized by fear and resignation. Power, above all military power, was the main goal of States, for even in times of peace, military power governed relations between States.\n154.\tIt is this unorganized and savage world, in which force takes precedence over the rule of law, that we have tried to change by adopting the Charter of the United Nations. Such a change is the fundamental meaning and highest objective of the Organization. Have we completely succeeded? We know very well that we have not, but we have sparked some hope in the world and have opened the way to another ambition for mankind, that of a world based on international law, on the sovereignty of States, on respect for the weak, on reciprocal assistance and on the refusal to use violence. Several elements tend to lead us to believe that war is no longer a normal instrument of international policy: regional cooperation among States, the balance brought about in some regions by strong alliances, the will to independence of peoples in the face of the biggest Powers and their contesting the fruits of invasion, and finally the devastating power of the weapons themselves.\n155.\tThe most striking and hopeful development, however, is the coming of age of world public opinion, which makes itself heard here in the United Nations, its point of convergence and its preferred means of expression. Aggression is not yet banished from the world we see this from recent and still current instances but it now involves a higher political cost and offers less promise of success. Aggression faces the general condemnation of the General Assembly, and its victims, feeling themselves supported, refuse to submit.\n156.\tSuch is the progress achieved. It is still modest, but it shows us a direction in which our efforts can usefully be aimed. Our awareness and our solidarity represent the principal chance for peace. Our first concern should be to develop them at the regional level, as well as in the world Organization.\n157.\tA particular and spectacular question that strikes public opinion is obviously the accumulation of armaments. It is a scandal that huge resources are thus spent each year to the detriment of the production of goods more beneficial to mankind. It is easy to wax indignant and to content oneself with words or to recommend radical disarmament measures. This is a natural and popular response, and it corresponds to a deep-seated sense of morality. However, if we look at the question dispassionately some basic facts stand out.\n158.\tThe first is that in the disarmament field, rhetoric cannot take the place of action. It is not the pedlars of dreams who best serve humanity. On the contrary, they tend to waste on illusions energies that could better be spent on the patient search for practical solutions.\n159.\tThe second point is that only those States or groups of States which nurture deep-seated mutual distrust enter the arms race. Many countries do not maintain any military apparatus against their neighbors, even though the means to do so are available to them. This is the case with the countries of Western Europe, which have developed ties of solidarity and enough mutual confidence to allow them to dispense with any kind of military precautions against each other.\n160.\tArmaments, therefore, are the consequence rather than the cause of distrust and hostility. If we truly wish to curb the arms race and Belgium certainly does we must first of all tackle the causes. Several approaches could, I think, be followed simultaneously.\n161.\tThe first and essential one is respect for the principle of noninterference in the affairs of other States, which was reaffirmed by General Assembly resolution 2131 (XX) of 21 December 1965. Without strict observance of this principle, no genuine progress towards peace can be achieved.\n162.\tNext, we must engage in the difficult but necessary dialog on problems that divide us. Even though conflicting viewpoints and interests cannot immediately be reconciled, such a dialog would gradually promote the accurate perception of the various motivations and views, the recognition of legitimate interests and, ultimately, a certain degree of tolerance and moderation and even cooperation in the search for solutions acceptable to all.\n163.\tThe third approach, without waiting for this general dialog to bear all its fruits, is to begin well-defined conversations on security problems. Such conversations should not be limited solely to armaments but should also bear upon the ideas different sides have of their security and the suitable means to ensure it. Between potential adversaries, security can best be grounded in the existence of an equilibrium, but this equilibrium itself is difficult to achieve. Each seeks to counter the opposing strategy as it guesses or fears that strategy to be. At times, such strategies determine which arms will be produced, and at other times they are themselves modified by the appearance of new weapons. We therefore seem to be witnessing a pitiful race taking place in darkness and confusion, in which each participant pushes himself to the limit for fear of taking a risk where his opponent's supposed strategy is concerned. In this area of dialog on disarmament, therefore, we must focus more sharply on the exchange of the precise ideas the parties have of their own security problems, their strategies and their weapons Programs.\n164.\tMy fourth recommendation would be to stress in the negotiations those measures which might decrease distrust and fear. Here, I should like to recall the steps taken in this regard by the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed at Helsinki, which, among other things, provides for prior notification of maneuvers and military movements of a certain scope. We think this is of great importance and are very anxious to see those agreements respected.\n165.\tWe should like to see further progress in this direction, leading to the holding of a conference on disarmament in Europe in the near future, the first aim of which would be to agree on militarily significant, compulsory and genuine confidence-building measures extending to the entire European continent. I mention the efforts undertaken on our own continent because I believe that this approach should also be attempted in other regions of the world, in ways, of course, suitable to each of them. Belgium is first and foremost desirous of obtaining practical results in matters of security and arms limitation and to this end has constantly advocated the free negotiation between neighbors of agreements likely to achieve these aims on a regional basis.\n166.\tMore clarity concerning military situations and a more accurate forecast of their possible modification by means of confidence-building measures on a regional level would allow all States concerned to proceed in an atmosphere of security towards genuine and far-reaching arms reduction measures. Indeed, is it not obvious that when States have divested themselves of the means of suddenly menacing their neighbors and have ceased to fear being suddenly menaced themselves, their interest would certainly be to reduce their military expenditures and to negotiate a stabilization of the balance at a reduced level of armaments? .\n167.\tA fifth approach pertains to arms limitation itself. We welcome the fact that a few weeks from now the United States and the Soviet Union will start negotiations on the limitation of medium-range nuclear weapons. My Government has actively encouraged the holding of such negotiations. If the rapid and genuine progress that we desire is to be made, it is essential that a number of principles be clearly established. First, we have to put a stop to the exchange of allegations and accusations, which poisons the atmosphere of the negotiations and tends to turn them into a propaganda exercise rather than a search for concrete results.\n168.\tWe must then recognize that the maintenance or restoration of equilibrium is a perfectly legitimate concern. Negotiations must start with the certainty that the equilibrium will be firmly assured in any eventuality, so that the negotiators can make a genuine, concerted attempt to reduce that equilibrium to its' lowest possible level. If this certainty is lacking there can be no assurance of the determination to hold genuine negotiations.\n169.\tFrom the outset we should concentrate our efforts on a limited number of arms and systems chosen from among those which are the most modern and of greatest concern that is, the most dangerous in a way that renders possible concrete and rapid results.\n170.\tI am well aware of the fact that the negotiations to which I am referring involve chiefly the United States and the Soviet Union, which possess these types of arms. But the negotiations are of concern to all of us, because they are an element of the strengthening of peace, to which we all aspire.\n171.\tWar, as I stated at the beginning of my speech, seems and should seem to be less and less a normal instrument of policy. But we must be aware of another danger, namely, the sudden creation by a brazen nation of faits accomplis, the results of which are then difficult to undo. As the penalties for war are forgotten, so the temptation for frustrated and ambitious States to resort to it, hoping for impunity, will increase. Thus, the defense of international law should remain our constant concern. It is our guarantee, particularly the weaker among us, in the face of the most powerful. It alone can ensure the stability and security of our day-to-day relations, on which the wellbeing of all peoples depends in our increasingly interdependent world.\n172.\tTo that end, we must remain watchful and ready to show, by our unanimous response, that a policy of fait accompli will bring general disapproval upon those who pursue it. We shall be able to prevent such action and apply effective sanctions only if we create among ourselves strong bonds of solidarity. No State will then lightly consider excluding itself from that solidarity and cooperation, from which all benefit. Such a state of affairs already largely exists in certain parts of the world on a regional basis. We must now develop it and extend it further so as to make it universal.\n173.\tThe defense of peace and international law therefore necessitates a search for solidarity and justice.\n174.\tHence, development cooperation is also essential in the search for peace. Just as transfers take place from richer to poorer areas within a country, so should they take place between nations. Balanced development of the family of nations and the reduction of economic disparities within it are thus prime concerns of the international community.\n175.\tAware of the fact that the poorest countries with practically no access to capital markets require an increased amount of official developmental aid, Belgium has progressively increased this type of assistance. At the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held recently in Paris, the Government of Belgium stressed the imperative need significantly to increase the volume and efficiency of the assistance to those countries. It announced that Belgium would pursue its efforts to attain, by 1985 at the latest, the goal of 0.15 per cent of its gross national product for assistance to the group of 31 most disadvantaged countries.\n176.\tThis assistance will not be at the cost of other developing countries; Belgium wishes to remain among the most active countries in matters of cooperation. The position taken by Belgium at the Paris Conference the latest manifestation of the dialog between developing and industrialized countries illustrates the positive and constant attitude of my country in the field of international economic cooperation.\n177.\tOver the last few years, and especially since the adoption of General Assembly resolution 34/138, calling for the launching of global and sustained negotiations on international economic cooperation, the Belgian Government has persistently demonstrated its determination to promote such negotiations, taking into account the mutual advantages, the common interests and the responsibilities of the parties involved.\n178.\tThe International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held at Cancun will bring together at the highest political level the representatives of 22 countries, from the most powerful to the neediest. We expect that this meeting will provide a new and much needed stimulus for the resumption of consultations leading to global negotiations.\n179.\tThe present difficulties should not blind us to the true progress that has been achieved in increasing <he general awareness of the strong Jink which exists between peace, justice and solidarity among our peoples. We can, I am convinced, advance along this road through a serious and practical approach. Let us not cling to what divides us. Rather, let us attempt, day by day, to develop confidence and cooperation among ourselves. At the same time, in order to strengthen our solidarity and promote a more reasonably organized security, let us follow both the regional and the global paths.\n180.\tThe Secretary-General in his report [A/36/1] rightly underlines the need to use the essential instrument the United Nations in a much more systematic, organized and regular manner so that it may better deal with the various aspects of international relations.\n181.\tI fully share the SecretaryGeneral's conviction, and I should like to pay a tribute to his untiring efforts to ensure respect for the laws and principles that the international community has laid down with such care.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, my delegation is pleased indeed to see someone of your unquestioned competence and wide experience in the President's chair, and we are confident that we can depend on your skill and wisdom to help us through the session ahead.\n64.\tMy delegation also welcomes this opportunity to extend our thanks, through you, to your predecessor, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany. We were extremely fortunate to be guided by his firm but always fair hand throughout a far from easy session. His quiet and determined conscientiousness, his sensitivity and his unfailing charm and courtesy will assure his fond remembrance by us all. We wish him well in his new post.\n65.\tThe SecretaryGeneral has again worked tirelessly over the past year, and we should like to pay a tribute to his ceaseless devotion to duty and his determined efforts in the cause of peace.\n66.\tWe are delighted to welcome the two new Members, Belize and Vanuatu. Both countries are fellow members of the Commonwealth, and we look forward to working with them in this forum also. Of course, Vanuatu's membership has special meaning for us, as we of the region felt strongly for Vanuatu during its sometimes troubled path to independence. We are especially proud to see how, with patience and perseverance, its people have found their rightful place in the international community. We know that the contributions that both those countries will make will, like their actions throughout their independence struggles, be the sort of fair-minded and carefully considered contributions that can only benefit the Organization. The admission to the United Nations of two small developing countries, which have the obvious economic weaknesses that many of us face but also a fierce determination to be their own people and to grapple for themselves with the problems of the future, is a further manifestation of the triumph of the human spirit and a tribute to the enlightened international community that has fashioned the climate for it to become a reality. Justly, like all of us, they are justly and rightfully proud of their nationhood and political independence. But they, and many of us like them more so perhaps than others in the world community will feel more keenly the reality that we cannot exist as nations without each other. The fact is that not even the large and resource-rich countries can go it alone today and still maintain for very long what they now enjoy.\n67.\tPerhaps in the past we in Samoa, removed from much of the turmoil and strife in the world, have viewed events from afar with a certain detachment, secure in our remoteness and the peacefulness of our region. But those days have gone. The world grows ever smaller, and all of us even the most geographically remote in some way feel the effects of events elsewhere and the actions of others around the world. The reality of interdependence in the world today demands genuine and urgent efforts on the part of all to recognize and to understand the problems and difficulties of others around the globe. Nowhere is that more true than in the economic sphere, and the sooner all countries, even the most seemingly self-sufficient and economically well-off, realize that, the sooner we can begin the fight to ensure that the world as we know it will survive.\n68.\tWe cannot continue to go our separate ways. No one country can be so self-centered as to insist that things be done its way and only its way, regardless of the views or the situation of the rest of the world. Such attitudes are, to say the least, not helpful in the world of today. We must work together on practical measures to solve problems such as inflation, energy costs, trade imbalances and foreign exchange difficulties.\n69.\tWe have heard much condemnation of protectionism, but in practice few remedies or meaningful accommodations have been found. We are grateful to those who have made the effort to assist in the Pacific in this? regard. The treaty with Australia and New Zealand to give Pacific island countries nonreciprocal duty-free access to the Australian and New Zealand markets for many of our products and other assistance in this area is a move which we welcome. Also, our relationship with the European Economic Community through the Lome Convention is extremely beneficial and important to us.\n70.\tBut however helpful those concessions may be, in the larger scheme of the world economy they are piecemeal measures. Other economic realities are fast overwhelming us, leaving the weaker economies, and especially the very vulnerable among them, like the least developed countries, the landlocked and the small island countries, in increasingly desperate situations. The plight of these countries is well known. They have the weakest economies in a world economic system which seems uncannily to ensure their perpetual disadvantage. In many cases they depend on a narrow range of products whose prices not only fluctuate wildly but slide backwards quite relentlessly relative to the prices of manufactured goods and other necessary imports. Sadly, this seems to have become the heritage of primary producers in the world market. Some of our countries are now facing chronic balance of payments problems which will surely undo the development efforts of the past and possibly even threaten political stability.\n71.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Paris last September attempted to focus on measures to launch the least developed countries on the path of sustained growth. Although the Conference could not be described as a resounding success, we applaud the encouraging attitudes and efforts of some of the developed countries at that Conference. The implementation of measures identified at that Conference holds out the only hope for the revitalization of the economies of the least developed countries. None of those measures, however, can be of lasting benefit to the least developed countries, or to anyone else, if they are not accompanied by international willingness to fashion a more just basis for international economic relations. We like to think that such an endeavor is not beyond the spirit of cooperation or the courage of a world that has grown so intricately interdependent. We very much hope that the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development at Cancun will provide the impetus necessary for the resumption of meaningful global negotiations on economic issues.\n72.\tThe law of the sea is another area in which the absolute necessity of mutual cooperation is illustrated. We are a global community, and in such a community the collective interest must be paramount. Many of us are heavily reliant on the sea for resources. We beg(tn the law of the sea negotiations many years ago on the noble assumption that a fair sharing of the sea's resources was possible and it seemed that, at long last, a convention that would provide as equitable a settlement as possible was within our grasp. Some had compromised on what they had felt they were justly entitled to in order that consensus for the good of the whole might be reached. The delay in the law of the sea timetable is therefore most dispiriting. We feel a tribute is due to the President of the Conference of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea for his energetic efforts to keep the whole process afloat. That there was some measure of achievement at the last two sessions of that Conference was due in large part to his tremendous energy, as well as to the patience of the many countries that have committed themselves to the successful conclusion of this unique undertaking.\n73.\tAs in the economic area, where the sharing of resources and the exchange of goodwill have become fundamental necessities, so in the political sphere we must share in the search for solutions. The United Nations must provide the main impetus towards such solutions.\n74.\tIn Namibia, South Africa must surely soon bow to the inevitable and abandon its posture of arrogant disregard for the world's opinion. We sincerely hope that common sense will prevail, for obviously South Africa cannot hold on to Namibia indefinitely, nor can a system that provokes worldwide horror continue without eventual bloody consequences. We deplore South Africa's stubborn refusal to abolish apartheid, and we feel its recent incursion into Angola it be an insult added to injury, for which South Africa must eventually pay. We look to a solution of the Namibian question based on Security Council resolution 435 (1978), and we urge the five Western countries to intensify their efforts to bring freedom to Namibia.\n75.\tIn the Middle East, the guidelines contained in United Nations resolutions are also clear. We believe in Israel's right to exist. We also believe in the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and a State of their own, should this be their wish. It is clear that all those involved must talk. Soliloquies and endless polemical slanging matches are nonproductive, whereas dialog can produce genuine communication and perhaps bring new perspectives to bear on the situation. Israel's recent actions, however, have not been conducive to dialog and have certainly not led to an improved general atmosphere, which might make eventual consultations possible. The policies of continuing settlements, altering the status of Jerusalem and the recent bombing of the Iraqi nuclear plant are deplorable acts.\n76.\tIn Lebanon, ceasefire after ceasefire has given way to hatred and violence. Innocent civilians have* suffered. In addition the United Nations peacekeeping forces have sustained many casualties. This senseless violence must cease. My delegation earnestly hopes that the present ceasefire will be the last, but this can only happen if those who use the situation in Lebanon to further their own ends refrain from so doing. UNIFIL must be allowed to do its job.\n77.\tThe situation in Afghanistan remains one of critical concern to the international community. The increase in foreign troops in Afghanistan during the past year and the growing number of refugees in Pakistan make the need to find a peaceful solution all the more urgent. The people of Afghanistan must be allowed to decide on their own leadership and to choose for themselves the political system they consider appropriate, without outside interference. The refugees have a right to return to their country without fear of reprisals.\n78.\tWe are disturbed to see that fighting continues between Iraq and Iran, two Islamic neighbors with much in common. Their quarrel must surely lend itself to a solution through discussion and negotiation rather than bloodshed and destruction. Surely, too, they are making unusable some of the very facilities over which they are in disagreement.\n79.\tIn Cyprus, as well, continued dialog is the preferred path towards a solution, and we commend the Secretary-General efforts to keep the inter-communal talks alive. We are encouraged that the prospects for progress in those talks appear brighter.\n80.\tThe tragedy of a people bitterly divided against itself remains unsolved in the Korean peninsula. We hope that the Koreans can begin to bring peace to their land through discussion and mutual accommodation.\n81.\tOn the Kampuchean situation, my delegation supports the initiatives taken by the countries of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations to bring this matter to resolution. We feel that the proposals contained in the declaration of the recent International Conference on Kampuchea suggest a useful framework for negotiation towards a settlement which would guarantee the Kampuchean people the right to select a government of their own choice, free from any intimidation, and allow the safe return of all refugees who wish to return. We sincerely hope that all parties to the conflict will eventually come to the negotiating table to restore stability to the SouthEast Asian region. We continue to be gravely concerned for the Kampuchean people, who have suffered so grievously in the past at the bloody hands of Pol Pot and his henchmen and who now labor under foreign domination. We earnestly hope that they may finally achieve a life free from fear, famine and fighting which have plagued them for so long.\n82.\tWe are pleased to see progress in one trouble spot of the world: Western Sahara. There, dialog has brought results, and at the last session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, decisions were taken that provide for a referendum that will enable the people of Western Sahara to determine their own future [see AI36I534, annex II, AHGI Res. 103 (XVIII)]. We are encouraged by this move towards a peaceful settlement.\n83.\tAll our efforts to improve our world by sharing those things that better our conditions whether they be our wealth, our resources, our cultures, or our solutions to political problems will be empty of meaning if nations continue to share in the inexplicable desire to increase military establishments and armaments. Tension between the superPowers has increased as they continue their race to produce super-weapons. Indeed, one such weapon is said to be so superior , and so refined that it can completely erase human beings without razing buildings or destroying other things considered to be of value.\n84.\tWe urge the superPowers to intensify their efforts to halt the arms race and eventually to move on to the progressive dismantling of existing weapons of destruction. We welcome their decision to discuss next month at Geneva the limitation of theater forces, and we look forward with hope to meaningful discussions between them in the future that would lead to overall balance and parity at the lowest possible levels, with the goal of effective reduction a future possibility. Mutual confidence is essential to the success of any disarmament talks, and we see confidence-building measures, however small, as steps in the right direction for the disarmament of both the big Powers and the third world. For let us not decry the big Powers as the only villains: many third world countries, much to our dismay, appear to put military priorities ahead of the health, welfare and education of their populations.\n85.\tWhen priorities in the world are that askew, our chances for ultimate survival seem dimmer and dimmer. But it is of little help to sink into the slough of despair. We must instead concentrate on possible measures that, however slowly, can start us on the road back to sanity. Such measures include the strengthening of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [General Assembly resolution 2373 (XXII)] to prevent the further spread of nuclear arms; the conclusion of a chemical weapons convention; security :guarantees for nonnuclear States; the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones; and, something of particular importance to the countries of the Pacific region, a comprehensive test-ban treaty so that all nuclear testing in any environment is stopped. Testing in the Pacific Ocean and the possibility of nuclear waste being dumped in our Ocean or any other have caused us great concern, both for the health of our peoples and for the purity of our environment. We wish those activities to cease.\n86.\tIf we can make progress on any of these matters at the coming special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament we shall have taken a satisfying step towards the preservation of our world.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should like, on behalf of the Ghana delegation and on my own behalf, to congratulate the President most warmly on his election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n271.\tHis election signifies a well-deserved international recognition of fits vast diplomatic experience, his capacity for hard work and the vitality of his ideas. There is no doubt that his long association with the United Nations will prove to be a major asset in the discharge of his onerous responsibilities as President of the Assembly. In offering him the best wishes of the Government of Ghana, and my delegation, for success in the weeks and months ahead, may I also assure him of our co-operation throughout his term of office.\n272.\t1 wish also to place on record the deep appreciation of the Government of Ghana for the brilliant and distinguished manner in which his predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, presided over the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are particularly appreciative of the personal efforts exerted by him in the search for a common basis on which to resume the deadlocked talks on the launching of the global negotiations. Although those efforts were not altogether successful, we none the less commend him for the crucial role he played in formulating the necessary understanding on which those negotiations can, in future, be based.\n273.\tThe Ghana delegation is also grateful to the Secretary-General and to his staff for the courage and dedication shown by them in their work during the past year.\n274.\tSince all nations must have an equal opportunity of participation in all decisions affecting the world community, U is a source of great delight for us to see new States accede to membership of the Organization. Our delegation is therefore happy to Join other speakers in warmly welcoming the new nations of Vanuatu and Belize as the 155th and 156th States Members of the United Nations. Their admission marks a further step towards the total eradication of colonialism and the ultimate goal of universality in the membership of the United Nations. We, for our part, look forward to fruitful and cordial relations with the Governments and the delegations of Vanuatu and Belize, not only within the United Nations itself but hi other international forums as well.\n275.\tSince the last session of the General Assembly, the international political scene has been far from encouraging; the political problems facing us have increased in complexity and our capacity to provide respite for an over-weary world continues to be seriously challenged. Critics of the Organization and those who lack faith in it are being furnished with ammunition to denigrate the efforts of the United Nations and to reinforce their belief that we are doomed to failure.\n276.\tFor example, despite several efforts both within and outside the United Nations system, the North-South dialog has so far not resulted in any decisive breakthrough in our endeavors towards the establishment of a new international economic order. The serious attempts to launch the global negotiations have similarly been rendered moribund. The plight of the developing countries continues to worsen from day to day as their development efforts are bedevilled by high payments Imbalances, unemployment, under-employment, Inflation and increasing debt burdens.\n277.\tMeanwhile, the arms race is speeding up at an alarming rate, resulting in the diversion of resources which, given political will and political courage, could have been utilized to Improve the economic and social conditions of the majority of mankind.\n278.\tIt is therefore self-evident that the Assembly is again convened in the midst of growing challenges for the international community. Whatever successes have been achieved during the last 12 months can only be described as limited. But that fact should not dampen our resolve to continue searching for meaningful but no less urgent solutions. On the contrary, the failures of the post year should increase our awareness of and, sensitivity to the precarious plight of mankind.\n279.\tSince the inception of the United Nations, and especially over the last 10 years, many calls have been made in this Assembly for urgent steps to be taken by the international community to grapple with the problems of development in such a way that all of us, whether rich or poor, large or small, could take a meaningful part in the international development process and act in concert to eliminate poverty, hunger, malnutrition and all the other attendant ills which continue to afflict mankind.\n280.\tIn spite of those perennial expressions of concern for the lot of humanity throughout the 36-year history of the Organization, there are more people today who are hungry, unsheltered and unclothed the world over than when our international quest for solutions began in earnest. The rich are becoming richer and the- poor poorer and the gap between the have and the have-not nations is widening into an unbridgeable abyss.\n281.\tIf we have awakened to the -wed for tackling this explosive, state of affairs in a realistic manner, it is not necessarily out of a feeling of altruism on the part of the fortunate towards the unfortunate. It seems true to observe that any real determination to apply permanent solutions to this problem stems more out of self-interest. Genuine interdependence among all nations -a concept which may have been misconstrued in the past- has become an imperative factor in international economic relations. Policies pursued in one country or group of countries have a direct effect on the lives of millions in other parts of the world. Self-interest, therefore, dictates that the well-being of the international community should be the primary concern of all.\n\n282.\tWith such, aspirations in mind, my country is watching with keen interest the personal involvement of leaders of the most powerful industrial countries of the West in attempts to restore the health of the international economy, Our assessment of the situation leads us to conclude that such direct involvement signifies that those nations rightly believe in the capacity of the international community to solve the problems currently besetting the world's economy and that they, like ourselves, refuse to accept failure. We should caution, however, that there is a great danger in seeing solutions in a self-centered perspective which undermines the United Nations in the formulation and application of global solutions. The initiative of those Industrialized countries should be structured in such a manner as would provide valuable inputs by the most privileged to the search for global solutions. Against that background may I be permitted to touch on one or two issues, of special importance to my country.\n283.\tBecause of its relevance to all aspects of development, the question of energy rightly dominates the political and economic thinking of all countries today. The international community has awakened to the fact that the major conventional forces of energy, which have been the basis of the energy balance of the modern world, may be depleted in the not too distant future and may .henceforth be available only at higher prices. Yet the most Important element, which should be given very serious consideration, is that the debilitating, impact of the energy crisis on the economies of the developing countries is massively out of all proportion to their share of total world energy consumption. That crisis has exacerbated general poverty and caused serious disruptions of unprecedented severity In developing countries whose developmental needs coincidentally involve increasing dependence on energy.\n284.\tThe food and agriculture situation in the world today gives cause for apprehension and anxiety. In 1974 the World Food Conference, held at Rome, targeted 1980 as the year by which the international community would have taken such steps as would lead to the complete elimination of hunger and malnutrition,\\\" in order that no child, wherever he might be, would go to bed hungry. It is a sad commentary on the efforts of the international community in that regard that today, when the technical ability of the international community to tackle the food problem has increased many times over what it was In 1974, in real terms more people are hungry than when the Conference made that historic resolve. In Africa, where the problems of development are present in their harrowing features, many millions of otherwise able men, women and children continue to face a real threat to their lives merely as a result of hunger and malnutrition in a world of exceptional scientific and technological progress.\n285.\tViewed against that disturbing backdrop, the Ghana delegation welcomes the decision of the IMF to broaden the existing compensatory financing facility to help cater for the needs of food-deficit developing countries. We hope that that facility will be greatly improved and expanded as the years go by. In the same vein, we recognize and appreciate the role which the International Bind for Agricultural Development tuts played in recent years in seeking to Increase food production in developing countries.\n286.\tMuch as we appreciate the steps being taken in the direction of general investment in. agriculture, we. are of the view that the initiatives to date, laudable as they are when considered in isolation, constitute a mere drop in the ocean when viewed in comparison with the immensity of actual needs. 1 am led to believe that the level of Investment required effectively to tackle the situation.will amount to something of the order of $600 billion over the next 10 years. That figure sounds really frightening in absolute terms, but it should not be beyond the capacity of the international community when we are investing - $500 billion each year in the production and refinement\nof instruments of war and destruction. It should also be possible, given the necessary political will, to divert into agriculture, for the edification of human life, a mere 12.5 per cent of the resources which we now devote, perhaps senselessly, to preparations for the final destruction of our own species. My Government continues to believe that only a speedy implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the 1974 Rome Conference could, avert $ world food crisis, in the immediate future.\n287.\tThe current economic climate demands of all of us an unequivocal determination to take concerted action designed to apply long-term remedies to the ills that beset the international economic system and to create conditions which favor the equal and effective participation of all its members in the development process. My Government, therefore, supports all the efforts still being made to launch the global negotiations. The tribulations which afflict the world should convince all and sundry that these negotiations should not be approached in a spirit of confrontation. They should, rather, be handled in the spirit of a mutual search for meaningful global solutions. In this connection, we are encouraged by recent developments in the preparations for the forthcoming International. Meeting on Co-operation and Development, to be held at Cancun, which we hope will put an end to the hesitations of the recent past and cause them to give way to the wholehearted support of all countries for. successful global negotiations.\n288.\tI now turn to some of the unsettled political issues of concern to the Government , of Ghana. There Is very little justification for the problem of Namibia remaining unresolved, especially as the principle of freedom involved in the independence of the \\\"territory and close United Nations Involvement in the final processes towards Independence have been accepted tad endorsed. What was outstanding as we faced the Geneva Conference ill January this year was the determination of the ways and means of taking care of residual but none the less important problems. But the entire world was witness to the dismal failure engineered by the racist Pretoria regime Worse still was the reluctance subsequently exhibited by some members of the Security Council when it came to giving the United Nations unequivocal support in its final efforts to restore legality and independence to Namibia. History will faithfully record that some delegations, which only a year ago hailed the United Nations independence plan, have today launched initiatives to modify Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and, it seems to us, even the independence plan. This sudden turn-about, unless properly handled, may very well result in the loss of the valuable gains made through that resolution.\n289. Under the guise of; a willingness to negotiate, the Fascist Pretoria regimes has openly engaged in delaying tactics, if not a rejection of its earlier commitment to the independence plan for Namibia, in a desperate effort to perpetuate its illegal occupation of that territory. It is for this reason that we are naturally skeptical of the efforts to modify the basic elements of resolution 435 (1978). It has been obvious over the past months that, instead of bringing no closer to a solution, these new attempts to alter the conscience embodied in resolution 435 (1978) have rather encouraged Pretoria to be more defiant and to resort to ever more desperate and repressive measures to defend and preserve its apartheid system, to perpetuate its illegal occupation of Namibia and to dominate the entire southern region of Africa. It has stepped up its reign of terror, designed to suppress the massive upsurge of nationalist feelings, by killing and maiming schoolchildren and detaining trade.union leaders and workers. A measure of its confidence, derived from the moral and material support it continues to receive from the most powerful and influential countries of the West, is the unprovoked and frequent attacks which it launches against neighbouring independent African States.\n230. In the context of our common search for international peace and security and the establishment of harmonious relations among States, we are compelled to condemn most vehemently the armed aggression against the People's Republic of Angola by the armed forces of the racist . Pretoria regime on 23 August 1981. We expect South Africa to make amends in due course by paying  Angola full and fair compensation for the damage to lives and property it has thus sustained. \n291.\tIn this regard, the Ghana delegation would like to take this opportunity to express its pleasure at and support for the outcome of. the eighth emergency special session on Namibia, which adopted a progressive resolution [resolution ES-812] to deal with the problem. The overwhelming support enjoyed by that resolution should persuade even the most hesitant of States Members of the United Nations to rally to the international effort to discipline the racist regime, to bring the Territory of Namibia , to legality and Independence, and completely to eradicate the system of apartheid.\n292.\tThe impasse over Namibia underscores the view of the overwhelming majority of the international community that sterile negotiations with the racist regime have gone oh for far too long and that the time has come for the international community to isolate South Africa politically and economically,\n293.\tIt is against this stern background that my Government and delegation have noted with considerable interest the joint statement issued on 25 September 1981 by the five Western countries associated with the quest for a speedy solution to the Namibia question. We note with a high sense of anticipation that, in the words of the joint statement, \\\"It is therefore now possible to identify more clearly the issues involved and a process for their resolution which would lead to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)\\\".\n294.\tThe recent incidents in the Middle East, especially the Israeli bombing raids on Iraq and the Lebanese capital, Beirut, have again underlined the grave dangers which the situation there represents for international security. It is true that a tenuous peace is now holding in the region, but the frequent resort to military and terrorist action means that much mote is now needed than mere verbal condemnation.\n295.\tTho Middle Bast conflict has remained unresolved for too long and has claimed far too many innocent lives. In my Government's view, any attempt to find a solution will obviously not succeed unless it adequately addresses two basic issues: the establishment of a line of communication between the major conflicting parties, and the settlement of the question of a permanent home for the Palestinians.\n296.\tThus, Ghana believes that in the present tense climate a realistic solution should contain the following elements: first, all parties to the conflict should start talking with each other instead of talking at each other.\n297.\tSecondly, the Palestinians should not be forced into accepting others to speak on their behalf. Arrangements whereby they are represented by other interests are unrealistic, inequitable and must be changed. Like the overwhelming majority of the United Nations membership, Ghana recognizes the PLO as the authentic representative organ of the Palestinian people. Happily, other international competences such as the QAU, the non-aligned movement and the European Community, have all accorded the PLO its due recognition as the body which should be involved in ail political negotiations relating to the future of the Palestinians.\n298.\tThirdly, Israel should withdraw from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967. We fully share the international consensus that Israel's policies in the occupied territories, marked by expropriation of land, eviction of local populations and the establishment of settlements, do not only constitute serious violations of international law but have seriously undermined prospects of peace in the region. The most influential friends of Israel, who number among the most powerful Member States of the Organization, owe it as a duty to humanity to review their posture in order to facilitate the achievement of a lasting solution.\n299.\tIt is a matter of deep regret for the Ghana delegation that we are beginning this session with a number of unsettled regional conflicts. The Iran-Iraq war, the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea readily come to mind. The early resolution of these conflicts would bring to an cud unnecessary human suffering and also remove the threat to the peace and stability of the regions concerned.\n300.\tGhana, therefore welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General to find an acceptable basis for ending the conflict in Afghanistan. We are also happy to endorse the outcome of the International Conference on Kampuchea held in July, and hope that the Ad Hoc Committee established at the end of the deliberations will redouble its efforts to elaborate proposals on which serious negotiations can commence on the basis of General Assembly resolution\n301.\tMy delegation Is equally concerned with the conflict situations in Africa because of the enormous suffering which they entail for our peoples and, more Importantly, because these conflicts seriously undermine the continent's ability to mobilize its resources, concert its actions and improve upon the already difficult economic and social conditions of its peoples. Ghana, therefore, appeals for the exercise of maximum restraint on all sides, as this is necessary for defusing these situations in a manner consistent with the region's imperative needs for socio-economic development.\n302.\tMy delegation would like, in this context, to express Ghana's gratitude to the organizers of the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa held at Geneva in April this year, which, we believe, served to arouse the conscience of the international community and make it more urgently aware of the magnitude of the refugee problem on that unfortunate continent. It is now universally acknowledged that Africa has the largest number of refugees and that African countries, already faced with grave socio-economic dilemmas, stand in need of urgent help from the international community. We none the less appreciate the spirit of co-operation and generosity demonstrated at the Conference by Governments which responded readily to the International appeal.\n303.\tIt is Ghana's hope that what has been accomplished at Geneva will serve as the forerunner of greater international support for the long-term needs of African refugees.\n304.\tAnother issue of serious concern to the Government of Ghana is that of disarmament and arms control, which constitutes one of the greatest challenges facing the international community. Expenditures on military technology and on research devoted to armaments are growing at an alarming rate. This terrible phenomenon continues apparently without due consideration for the fact that in a world of action and reaction the security of nations is not automatically enhanced by resort to high levels of armaments.\n305.\tIt is therefore a matter of deep regret for the Ghana delegation that no serious negotiations have been started with a view to implementing Important disarmament agreements suspended two years ago, in spite of the innocent protestation? of the. big Powers.\n306.\tWhile we call for an early resumption of talks, It is equally essential to emphasize the need for the exercise of the greatest flexibility on the part of all concerned if meaningful progress is to be made towards dispelling today's climate of distrust.\n307.\tIt is important that we break the psychological barrier of mutual suspicion and, instead, maintain a healthy momentum in the disarmament talks and negotiations. Ghana consequently welcomes the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament planned for 1982. We sincerely hope that the second special session will provide an opportunity for the international community to examine the whole question seriously, with a view to reaching agreement on those areas where progress has not been made since the first session, including fundamental issues which have impeded meaningful progress. My delegation stands ready to co-operate with\nothers in order to ensure a successful outcome of this special session.\n308.\tThere is no denying that the United Nations provides an essential instrument for achieving the objectives of world peace and security. It is our Obligation, therefore, not only to show abiding faith in the Organization but also to strengthen its capacity for peaceful action on behalf of the world community.\n309.\tPeace-keeping operations necessarily form an essential pail of the activities of the United Nations. By stationing military contingents in sensitive areas, the Organization has helped substantially to contain Or defuse situations which would otherwise have exploded into major armed conflicts. Such activities have been criticized by some, but the critics cannot be blind to the objective fact that they have been an invaluable factor in establishing an appropriate climate for the settlement of serious disputes. The lot of the United Nations soldier is an especially difficult one, and it is only when we contemplate the damage that could result from the absence of peacekeeping forces from the flash-points of conflict that we can appreciate how important it is that Member States extend their full support to United Nations peace-keeping operations.\n310.\tAmong the most serious problems which the United Nations peace-keeping operations have faced over the years arc delays in the payment of assessed contributions and the insufficiency of voluntary contributions. We are aware of the difficulties encountered in soliciting financial contributions to the United Nations peace-keeping activities. It seems obvious,, however that persistent denial of adequate means is undermining the United Nations peace-keeping efforts to such a point that we shall all stand to lose if this trend is allowed to continue. We therefore hope that all Member States will endeavour to review current attitudes in the interest of a more positive appreciation of the peace-keeping role of the United Nations and thus accord it all the support required.\n311.\tThe United Nations provides the appropriate forum for the promotion of international security, peace and prosperity, all of which our world cannot afford to do without. A strong and effective United Nations demands, above all, that we keep the principles of the Charter inviolate. The United Nations, is our best creation. Let us give it a growing chance to serve, unwell. Let us give, it full and unequivocal support.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is a tribute to your personal qualities and, through you, it constitutes unanimous recognition of the important role that your country is playing on the international scene. I am pleased, therefore, on behalf of my delegation to join those who preceded me on this rostrum in addressing to you our warmest and most sincere congratulations. We are convinced that, thanks to your qualities as a statesman, as well as your profound knowledge of international affairs, you will be able to conduct our proceedings to everyone's great satisfaction. It is my sincere wish that the high mission which has been entrusted to you will be completely successful. I should like to assure you of my delegation's full and frank cooperation.\n2.\tOn behalf of my delegation I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, who displayed his typical wisdom, devotion and dynamism in directing the work of the thirty-fifth regular session, as well as that of the eighth emergency special session, devoted to the question of Namibia.\n3.\tIt is particularly gratifying for me to reiterate the deep appreciation of the Government of the Rwandese Republic to the SecretaryGeneral for the skill and devotion with which he has discharged his noble and onerous mission. The tireless efforts which he continues to make to further the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations have always claimed my country's attention and deserve our gratitude.\n4.\tMay I also avail myself afthis auspicious occasion to welcome among us the representatives of the Republic of Vanuatu and of Belize, whose admission to membership of the United Nations undoubtedly strengthens the universality of the Organization and contributes to achieving one of its fundamental goals, that of freeing peoples from the yoke of colonialism.\n5.\tThe current session is being held at a time when the international political situation does not give much ground for optimism in view of the continuing factors of tension and instability, which we have already had occasion to deplore last year.\n6.\tFurthermore, the international economic situation is continuing to deteriorate to the detriment of the least-developed countries, and the multilateral negotiations to establish a new international economic order are still deadlocked.\n7.\tOver a year ago we welcomed from this rostrum the independence of the people of Zimbabwe and their entry into the great family of the United Nations after a long and heroic liberation struggle. At that time, it was our opinion that Zimbabwe's accession to independence represented a further step towards decolonization, and at that time we expressed the hope that it would provide encouragement for other peoples still subject to colonial oppression and domination.\n8.\tAlthough there are reasons today for being pleased at the progress which has been achieved in the field of decolonization we cannot, at the same time, fail to observe that, unfortunately, many peoples are still suffering from the aftermath of colonization and are the victims of domination and racial discrimination. This is particularly true in Namibia, South Africa, Western Sahara and elsewhere where obsolete conditions continue to exist and dangerously threaten international peace and security.\n9.\tTherefore, we deeply deplore the present situation in southern Africa resulting from the arrogance and intransigence of a regime which has raised colonialism, racism, aggression and repression to the level of government policy in contempt of the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations, which has unambiguously condemned apartheid as being a crime against humanity, and has unreservedly expressed moral, political and economic support for the oppressed people of Namibia and South Africa.\n10.\tIn Namibia the racist and regressive Pretoria regime continues to defy the international community by refusing to implement the United Nations plan for that Territory's accession to independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The efforts which have been undertaken continuously in many quarters to put an end to South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia have always come Up against Pretoria's dilatory tactics and intransigence.\nA/36/PV.21\n11.\tThe aggressive posture adopted by, the .South African Government, which is the root cause of the failure \nof the pre-implementation meeting on Namibia, held at Geneva in January 1981, the barbaric oppression of the Namibian people, the illegal exploitation of the natural wealth of that Territory, as well as of barbaric aggression against independent African countries in southern Africa, particularly the People's Republic of Angola, Botswana and Mozambique. The international community is duty bound to. condemn these acts unambiguously and vigorously.\n12.\tRwanda fully supports the Namibian people's right to self-determination and independence. It cannot be sacrificed on the .altar of the selfish interests of certain States Members of the United Nations which, despite the repeated appeals made to them, continue to cooperate with South Africa in economic, military, nuclear and other areas, thus encouraging the racist Pretoria regime to continue to hold the decisions of the international community in contempt.\n13.\tThe Rwandese Republic continues to believe that the Western countries belonging to what is known as the contact group still have a primary role to play in ensuring the success of the United Nations efforts to compel South Africa to withdraw from Namibia and to secure that Territory's .accession to independence. My delegation once. again solemnly appeals to the Assembly and to the entire international community to do everything possible to impose the enforcement measures needed to compel the racist South African regime to slacken its grip on Namibia.\n14.\tThe delegation of Rwanda would like to reaffirm its unstinting support for the valiant people of Namibia who, under the leadership of its sole authentic representative, the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], are waging an heroic struggle for the liberation of their country.\n15.\tWe should also like to reiterate our support for our brothers of the African front-line States for the sacrifices which they are continuing to make to help the freedom fighters in southern Africa in their struggle to free their territories.\n16.\tIn South Africa itself the racist regime of Pretoria continues its ignominious policy of apartheid and racial discrimination, which strikes at the black population in particular, and sees fit to defy the resolutions of the United Nations enjoining it to put an end to that inhuman and criminal system.\n17.\tThe acts of violence and of oppression which have been perpetrated by those in power in South Africa, the barbaric .massacres of innocent people who are only claiming their right to life, freedom, equity and human dignity, are not merely a flagrant violation of human rights and a crime against mankind, but also a factor making for instability in the region, as well as a real threat to intern^?' peace and security.\n18.\tMy allegation remains firmly convinced that all countries which cherish peace and justice should exert strong pressure, both political and economic, to force the Pretoria regime to put an end to its racist and oppressive policy and to its illegal occupation of Namibia and to end its flagrant violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighboring African States.\n19.\tStill in connection with Africa, the question of Western Sahara is no less a matter of concern to the Rwandese Republic. In recent years the international community has made every effort to find a solution to that problem, which, in the view of Rwanda, is one of decolonization.\n20.\tThe Rwandese Republic, which continues to give its unflagging support to the just cause of the Sahraoui people, hopes that, since Morocco, at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity held at Nairobi in June 1981, accepted the idea of organizing and holding a referendum in Western Sahara, the Sahraoui people will this time be able fully and without impediment to exercise their right to self-determination and to choose their future freely,\n21.\tElsewhere in Africa the persistence of fratricidal conflicts and the proliferation of hotbeds of tension dangerously imperil peace and stability in the regions affected. They often provide fertile ground for foreign interference.\n22.\tIn the case of all these conflicts, my delegation remains convinced that strict respect for the principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in that of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] should induce the parties concerned to seek a solution to their disputes.\n23.\tFor more than 30 years the Middle East has been one of the most dangerous hotbeds of tension, constantly threatening international peace and security because of the aggressive and expansionist policies of Israel, which stubbornly refuses to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n24.\tThe recrudescence in recent months of barbaric attacks by Israel against its neighbors has made the situation even more explosive in that part of the world and provides grounds for disquiet.\n25.\tThe Rwandese Government remains convinced that no settlement of the Middle East problem as a whole can be achieved without the full association of the Palestinian people, who, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], their sole and authentic representative, are seeking to recover their legitimate rights.\n26.\tIn this connection, I should like to say again, on behalf of the Rwandese Government, that a just and lasting peace will only be achieved in that area when Israel has unconditionally withdrawn from all the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967, including the city of Jerusalem, and has recognized the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, particularly their right to self-determination and to set up their own independent and sovereign State.\n27.\tThe situation which at present prevails in Lebanon is a matter of serious concern to my delegation, because the threat hanging over that country's unity and integrity, exacerbated by Israel's aggressive actions against Palestinian camps in Lebanon, constitutes a factor of instability in the region and a serious threat to world peace. We hope that the efforts of the international community to restore peace to that country, so sorely tried by years of fratricidal wars, will lead to lasting results and that the Lebanese people will one day recover the peace and tranquility they need in order to devote themselves to the arduous task of national reconstruction after so many years of suffering.\n28.\tTurning to the delicate problem of Cyprus, which sees its unity and territorial integrity threatened, my country deplores the fact that the numerous resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly with a view to restoring peace to the island have not so far yielded all the expected results.\n29.\tWe appeal to the consciences of both communities on the island and urge them to find ways and means of helping to promote the reestablishment of peace in the country and the consolidation of the unity and territorial integrity of that State, the nonaligned status of which should be respected.\n30.\tRwanda cannot remain indifferent to the situation which persists in Afghanistan and the tensions which prevail in SouthEast Asia. The persistence of such hotbeds of conflict remains a factor of instability and a serious threat to peace and security in that region.\n31.\tTherefore a political solution should quickly be found on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops and respect for the sovereignty, national independence and territorial integrity of all States in the regions affected.\n32.\tThe Korean question is of the greatest concern to the international community. The Rwandese Republic follows with interest and strongly supports the efforts made by the parties concerned to bring about a peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation. This approach to the problem presupposes the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from that area to enable the Korean people freely to solve their problem of reunification.\n33.\tThe Government of Rwanda has constantly made known its views on the subject of divided nations. It has always believed that the peoples involved have the inalienable right to find ways to end such a tragic situation.\n34.\tThat being so, we are gratified by the spirit of detente which prevails in relations between the two Gem&*? States. It is our earnest hope that the cooperative relations established between these two States will be exploited as thoroughly as possible in attempts to find a peaceful and freely agreed solution to the problem of the reunification of the German nation.\n35.\t'\tAmong the major items on the agenda of the present session is disarmament. The first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament succeeded in alerting the international community to the dangers threatening mankind because of the proliferation of weapons of all kinds, and particularly nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. Following that session a number of important initiatives were seen, such as the signing by the two major Powers of the SALT I and SALT II agreements on the limitation of strategic arms.\n36.\tUnfortunately, three years after that special session little progress has been made towards disarmament, and detente has given way to rivalry and the intensification of the major Powers' games of influence, thus gravely compromising peace and security in the world.\n37.\tMy country has always expressed its grave concern about the growing danger inherent in the spiraling arms race and its damaging effects on the economic and social development of all countries, and particularly the poorest. I; is scandalous that while two thirds of mankind live in abject poverty fabulous sums are being spent each day on the manufacture of arms and on building up arsenals of weapons for the destruction of human life.\n38.\tThe Rwandese Government repeats its appeal that those sums should rather be devoted to increasing assistance to the least developed countries to improve the standard of living of their peoples.\n39.\tThe increased foreign military presence in the Indian Ocean, despite the General Assembly Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], also causes great concern. Rwanda would encourage any initiative designed to make the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace.\n40.\tThat is why we are among those, who believe that an international conference on the Indian Ocean should be held, with the participation of representatives of the major Powers and of the littoral and hinterland countries of the Indian Ocean region, in the hope that this will make possible specific measures to make the Indian Ocean a genuine zone of peace.\n41.\tI should like to make some remarks about the present international economic situation, which is characterized by recession, unemployment, deterioration in the terms of trade, inflation, disorder in the international monetary system, the growing indebtedness of the developing countries and the depletion of energy resources, not to mention the food shortages which so seriously affect some parts of the world.\n42.\tThe economic situation and the economic outlook are particularly gloomy for the developing countries. The deficit suffered by all the non-oil-producing developing countries continues to increase and according to certain experts could well reach $100 billion in 1982. At the same time, off Jul development aid is no more than 0.27 per cent of the gross national product of the wealthy countries, whereas the target decided upon during the Second United Nations Development Decade was 0.7 per cent.\n43.\tThe result of such a situation is stagnation indeed, a slump in the economies of the developing countries, whose populations are condemned to malnutrition, sickness, poverty and deprivation. This persisting sickness in the international economic system is not a purely transitory phenomenon. It is, rather, the symptom of deep, underlying, structural imbalances, which call for bold reforms in certain important and vital areas, such as food, energy and development aid, and the reform of the international monetary system and the primary commodities system. An effective remedy for the serious international economic situation would be the active participation of all countries, and particularly the developed countries, in the restructuring of international economic relations, but, unfortunately, it must be said that the attempts made so far have been doomed to failure because of the selfishness and lack of political will of certain wealthy countries.\n44.\tTVvo United Nations Development Decades \\\"have passed without achieving the targets set. Similarly, the negotiations initiated after the sixth special session of the General Assembly, which were intended to provide a new foundation for international economic relations, have not yet enabled us to glimpse the possibility of a new international economic order.\n45.\tthe action plans which were drawn up successively at Lima, Buenos Aires, Vienna and New Delhi, in the framework of UNIDO and UNCTAD conferences, have not yet even begun to be implemented. More than a year ago the eleventh special session ci the General Assembly, which was intended to initiate the resumption of the global negotiations in the NorthSouth dialog, ended its work without having been able to reach agreement even on matters of procedure.\n46.\tToday, & we enter the second year of the Third United Nations Development Decade, the economic situation is deteriorating more and more for the developing countries, which are the hardest hit by the effects of the international economic crisis.\n47.\tIn view of this list of failures and the grave dangers which threaten the world because of the inequality and injustice which are characteristic features of the present international economic 'situation, the developed countries should evince greater realism and understanding. They should realize that the future of the world cannot be built without taking into account the developing countries, which make up two thirds of mankind. On the contrary, the time is now ripe for solidarity, for cooperation based on justice and equity and for interdependence among all nations. It is high time for the developed countries to reaffirm, today even more than in the past, their political will to work in harmony with the nations of the third world to bring about a new international economic order.\n48.\tRwanda, for its part, vigorously supports the continuance of the negotiations which are at present under way within the United Nations with the aim of bringing about a new type of international economic relationship. It is our belief that those negotiations should be of a comprehensive nature and should focus particularly on important issues such as development aid, energy, basic raw materials and the reform of the international monetary system. It is our sincere hope that during the present session the General Assembly will be able to remove the last of the obstacles which have hitherto stood in the way of a NorthSouth dialog, so that global negotiations may be initiated without delay.\n49.\tIn the course of such negotiations, special attention should be paid to the least developed and landlocked countries, one of which, unfortunately, is Rwanda itself. Those countries, above and beyond the difficulties which they experience because of the present international economic situation, also have to overcome other problems which are due particularly to their enclaved location.\n50.\tIn this connection, we were very pleased by the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Plans from 1 to 14 September 1981. It is our sincere hope that the measures drawn up by that Conference with the aim of promoting the in interests of that category of countries' will be transformed into concrete action which will enable them to tackle their own specific problems.\n51.\tAlthough we welcomed the special measures adopted by the United Nations in favor of the landlocked developing countries, today, unfortunately, we can only express regret that it has taken so long for those measures to become operational. I am thinking particularly of the United Nations Special Fund for Landlocked Developing Countries, which lacks sufficient contributions fully to play the role for which it was created.\n52.\tSimilarly, Rwanda is following very closely the negotiations taking place within the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, although we regret the fact that certain issues have been reopened, thus impeding the work of the important Conference. My delegation would like once again to emphasize that the right of landlocked countries to access to the sea and freedom of transit through third countries should be reaffirmed and guaranteed in the international convention which will result from the negotiations on the law of the sea.\n53.\tFurthermore, my country welcomed the convening of the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy at Nairobi from 10 to 21 August 1981. It will provide us with some food for thought as to how to pursue the search for new sources of energy.\n54.\tIn the light of the present international economic crisis, which affects all countries but more specifically the developing countries, it is imperative that the developing countries initiate action in order to achieve collective autonomy.\n55.\tIn this connection, the Rwandese Republic will continue to give active support to all initiatives which are designed to promote economic cooperation among the developing countries, because this is the only hope of salvation in the face of continual obstruction by the wealthy countries, which hitherto have paid very little attention to the claims of the countries of the third world regarding the establishment of a more just and equitable new international economic order.\n56.\tIt is for this reason that Rwanda has very close links of cooperation with neighboring and fraternal countries in both regional and subregional organizations.\n57.\tSimilarly, Rwanda considers the Lagos Plan of Action to be the vital and unanimous expression of the political will of African countries to undertake, step by step, concerted action to ensure endogenous, self-sustaining development leading between now and the year 2000 to the creation of an African common market, which would be the prelude to an integrated African economic community.\n58.\tFinally, we are very pleased that specific links have been established between the European Community and more than 50 countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Those links will undoubtedly provide a model for viable and positive cooperation between developed and developing countries.\n59.\tTo guarantee international security, to work to promote peace, to foster economic development and to help colonized peoples to find their freedom these are all noble objectives to which the Organization has devoted itself with faith and perseverance for 36 years. My delegation is convinced that the United Nations is without any doubt the ideal framework for negotiations in which we can reconcile our differing viewpoints, resolve conflicts and develop a spirit of solidarity and interdependence among peoples despite their ideological and other differences. I should therefore like to reiterate the unshakable faith of my country in the Organization.\n60.\tThe Rwandese Republic recognizes that the United Nations has a unique part to play in maintaining peace and justice and in the struggle to ensure the wellbeing of people throughout the world. We shall never fail to support its efforts in the search for solutions to the various problems of our time.\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and people of Japan, I should like to extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kittani on his election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that with his abundant experience in the United Nations and his manifest wisdom this session of the Assembly will prove to be a most fruitful one. The delegation of Japan, which shares his Asian heritage, will spare no effort in cooperating with him in the performance of his important duties.\n105.\tI should also like to express our deep appreciation to the President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar, for his extraordinary accomplishments. We have been greatly impressed by his decisiveness and outstanding leadership throughout his tenure as President.\n106.\tAt the same time, I should like to pay a sincere tribute to the SecretaryGeneral. It was a great pleasure for me to be able to invite him to my country last June for an exchange of views on various questions with which the United Nations is engaged.\n107.\tI wish also to take this opportunity to extend a most cordial welcome to Vanuatu, a friendly country in the South Pacific, on its admission to the United Nations. My country looks forward to promoting relations of friendship and cooperation with this new Member State, both within and outside the United Nations.\n108.\tToday's world is characterized by flux and instability in political situations as well as in international economic relations. I should like to take up, first of all, the question of disarmament  as a means of reversing the trend of world instability and setting the international community on a more solid foundation.\n109.\tThe awesome development in recent years of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems could lead to the danger of instantly bringing mankind to the brink of total annihilation. It is the most urgent task for the sake of world stability and development to halt the arms race and achieve disarmament, including the total elimination of nuclear weapons.\n110.\tToday, while the dialog between East and West is stalled, nuclear testing continues to be conducted, the production of nuclear weapons accelerated, their sophistication and diversification further promoted, and their deployment rapidly increased. Indeed, the total strength of the nuclear arsenal in the world today is said to be equivalent to about one million Hiroshima bombs. And yet there seems to be no cessation of the nuclear arms race. This situation gravely threatens mankind. Japan strongly urges all nuclear-weapon States to recognize their grave responsibilities to future generations and to make utmost efforts, from a broader perspective, towards the promotion of nuclear disarmament for the peace and security of the world.\n111.\tIn particular, Japan implores both the United States and the Soviet Union to be mindful of their crucial responsibilities and to make every effort in promoting negotiations aiming at the limitation and substantial reduction of strategic weapons. In this connection, I welcome the recent indications that negotiations may begin between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of theater nuclear forces. It is my earnest hope that the two countries will take advantage of the opportunity to promote the dialog for strengthening World peace and stability.\n112.\tIn my statement on the occasion of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, the first devoted to disarmament, in 1978, I made an appeal to the effect that: \\\"If we wish to move towards the realization of general and complete disarmament, there is no way open to us other than to keep this ideal always in mind and to proceed step by step with concrete and feasible measures\\\". [9th meeting, para. 116.]\n113.\tWhile the attainment of general and complete disarmament is the common goal of all mankind, at the same time disarmament is inseparable from the maintenance of the security of each State, and therefore, needless to say, it is difficult to promote. It should be frankly admitted that in the present international community, the balance of power among countries, whether on a regional or a global scale, constitutes a basis for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n114.\tHowever, in order to place the international community on a more stable foundation in the long run, Japan considers it essential to pursue genuine disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, so that peace and security can be secured at a lower level of armament while maintaining the balance of power. Keeping this goal in mind, we should make efforts, step by step, towards disarmament measures accompanied by effective means of verification. I earnestly hope that resources will be released by disarmament efforts and reallocated for promoting international cultural exchange, and for contributing to a solution of the NorthSouth problem as well as to the development of the world economy.\n115.\tJapan is of the view that a comprehensive nuclear test ban constitutes the first step in halting the nuclear arms race: it is the most urgent task among all concrete disarmament measures and should be realized as soon as possible. I also strongly urge that negotiations be expedited towards the prohibition of chemical weapons which, like nuclear weapons, are weapons of mass destruction.\n116.\tJapan sincerely hopes that the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to be convened next year will impel the international community to halt the continuing arms race which threatens mankind with unthinkable catastrophe, and initiate serious international efforts towards the ultimate elimination of all types of nuclear weapons. In this regard, Japan expects the second special session, to review the factors which have obstructed developments in the field of disarmament since the first special session and to conduct concrete and constructive deliberations on ways and means of making progress towards general and complete disarmament. Japan, strictly upholding the three nonnuclear principles of not possessing nuclear weapons, not producing them and not permitting their introduction into Japan and wishing to promote disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, is resolved to play a positive role towards this goal.\n\n117.\tIt goes without saying that a stable and expanding world economy is indispensable if those forces unsettling the world today are to be eliminated and peace and prosperity are to be achieved. Since the two oil crises, many countries have been confronted with difficulties: severe recessions, increased unemployment, accelerated rates of inflation and a disequilibrium in their balance of payments. On the other hand, as the economies of nations become increasingly interdependent, the bond is becoming stronger between developed and developing countries, which are passengers sharing a common fate on the great ship of the world economy.\n118.\tUnder these circumstances, the one and only direction in which NorthSouth relations can proceed is towards cooperation and mutual reinforcement by donor and recipient countries to improve the world economy and intensify the quest for world peace. We firmly believe that NorthSouth confrontation must cease, and that the new relationship between North and South, in this period of transition into a new era, should be based on a spirit of interdependence and a mutuality of interests.\n119.\tOn the basis of this belief, Japan intends to deal vigorously with NorthSouth problems and contribute to the promotion of a constructive NorthSouth dialog. \n120.\tAs is known, Japan supports the launching of the global negotiations at the earliest date possible as part of this NorthSouth dialog. With regard to the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held next month at Cancun, Japan will strive to make the most of this important opportunity to promote a North South dialog based on the recognition of our interdependence and mutuality of interests. I earnestly hope that one result of that meeting will be the creation of a favorable climate for the launching of the global negotiations.\n121.\tJapan has been actively promoting economic cooperation in order to contribute to the solution of the NorthSouth problem and also to the maintenance of peace and stability in the world.\n122.\tJapan therefore attaches great importance to the expansion and improvement of official development assistance, and in 1978 set as its medium term target the doubling of its official development assistance within three years. In 1980, the final year, Japan surpassed that target in its official development assistance disbursements. In January of this year we established a new medium term target, and, in striving to achieve that target, Japan will continue to improve its ratio of official development assistance to gross national product, and will make an effort, in the five-year period beginning in 1981, to more than double the total official development assistance disbursed in the five-year period 19761980: in other words, more than $21.4 billion over the next five years. Despite its strained financial situation, Japan is sparing no effort to expand and improve its official development assistance.\n123.\tIn the implementation of assistance, Japan intends to continue to place emphasis on such areas as rural and agricultural development, development of energy sources, aid for basic human needs and cooperation for the development of human resources, since it is in those areas that a direct contribution can be made to the stabilization of the livelihood and improvement of the welfare of people in developing countries.\n124.\tIn the trade area, Japan decided this year to extend the application period of the Generalized System of Preferences for another 10 year period in order to help promote the trade efforts of developing countries. In addition, since April 1980 there have been in effect such special measures as free preferential rates of duty and the abolition of ceilings with respect, as a rule, to all products covered by the System originating from the least developed countries.\n125.\tWith regard to the Common Fund for Commodities, to the finalization of which Japan actively contributed, Japan became a party to the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund in June of this year in the hope of facilitating its early inception. We believe that the Common Fund, which was agreed upon after long and difficult negotiations as a means to achieve the stabilization of the prices of the primary commodities developing countries produce, is a noteworthy achievement in the history of NorthSouth relations. It is our strong hope that Member States will expeditiously become parties to the Agreement so that it can come into force by the target date of 31 March 1982.\n126.\tNow I should like to take up the major problems which have brought about instability in the present international situation, and to present the views of my Government.\n\n127.\tIn considering the unstable situations in the world today, Japan, as an Asian nation, must first of all take up the situation in Kampuchea, which has gravely affected the peace and stability of SouthEast Asia. The core of the Kampuchean problem lies in the fact that foreign military intervention has led to the denial of the Kampuchean people's right of self-determination and that, as a result, SouthEast Asia's peace and security have been threatened and its stability and prosperity disrupted,\n128.\tIn this connection, we were gratified that, as a first step towards the solution of the Kampuchean problem, the International Conference on Kampuchea was convened last July in accordance with General Assembly resolution 35/6, with the participation of two thirds of the States Members of the United Nations, including a large number of nonaligned countries. My delegation sincerely welcomed the adoption by consensus of the Declaration and the resolution of the Conference on Kampuchea.13\n129.\tI strongly appeal to all countries concerned that they respect the principles and concrete measures contained in the Declaration of the Conference, which reflects the voice of the international community and aims at a comprehensive political solution of the Kampuchean problem. Also, we urge that negotiations be started promptly for the withdrawal of foreign forces and the holding of free elections under the supervision of the United Nations.\n130.\tJapan, as an elected member of the Ad Hoc Committee established by the Conference, will contribute to the best of its ability to the earliest possible restoration of peace in Kampuchea.\n131.\tIn the process leading to negotiations on the solution, I believe it might also be useful if, for example, the SecretaryGeneral, in close contact with the Ad Hoc Committee, would send to the countries concerned, including those absent from the Conference, a special representative who would convey to them the results of the Conference and explore means of facilitating negotiations for a comprehensive political solution.\n132.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express my deep sympathy to Thailand, which is bearing a heavy burden imposed by the influx of Indochinese refugees, including those from Kampuchea. The Government of Japan pays high tribute to the efforts of the United Nations in providing relief assistance to the Indochinese refugees and in expediting their voluntary return to their homelands, and further earnestly hopes that the Organization will play an even more effective role in the future. Japan has been actively extending relief assistance to the Indochinese refugees for humanitarian reasons and also in the hope of reducing the heavy burden borne by the nations of SouthEast Asia. However, in solving the refugee problem it is of urgent importance, not only to provide relief assistance to refugees, but also to find ways to eradicate the root cause of the refugee problem. Japan therefore renews its appeal to those countries from which refugees are fleeing to make further efforts to restrain their outflow.\n133.\tI should like to say a few words about the Korean peninsula. I firmly support the proposal made recently by the Government of the Republic of Korea that a dialog between the South and North be resumed, for example by exchanging visits between the top leaders of both sides. It is my earnest hope that continued efforts will be made for the.realization of such a dialog. The United Nations has so far played an important role in restoring and maintain \ning peace in the Korean peninsula, and consideration should be given to utilizing the SecretaryGeneral's good offices to enable South and North Korea to resume a dialog.\n134.\t<1 cannot help noting that serious events which have resulted in the destabilization of the international situation have centred on the SouthWest Asian region as well as the Middle East.\n135.\tThe Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan an armed intervention by foreign troops denying a nation its right of self-determination is an undisguised challenge to international justice and to the Charter of the United Nations. It can in no way be condoned. On this occasion, I should like once again to appeal, in the strongest terms, to the Soviet Union to heed the repeated calls of the international community and immediately withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and respect the Afghan people's right of self-determination.\n136.\tMy country fully sympathizes with the Government of Pakistan, which is experiencing manifold difficulties in receiving refugees from Afghanistan. It intends to continue for humanitarian reasons, as .well as from considerations of regional peace and stability, to extend positive cooperation to relief activities through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as through other organizations.\n137.\tWe are deeply concerned by the continued fighting that unfortunately broke out between Iran and Iraq last year. I should like to urge those two countries to cease fighting as soon as possible and to settle the conflict by peaceful means in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Moreover, I should like to appeal to them to cooperate so that the conciliation efforts of the United Nations, through the SecretaryGeneral's representative, may be successful.\n138.\tThe peace and stability of the Middle East are essential to the peace and prosperity of the world. Japan strongly hopes that a just, lasting and comprehensive peace will be achieved in the region by peaceful means and at an early date. It is of the view that such a peace should be achieved through the complete implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and through recognition of and respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the right of self-determination under the Charter.\n139.\tJapan further believes that in order to achieve a just solution to the question of Palestine, which constitutes the core of the Middle East question, it is necessary that both the Palestinian people's right of self-determination and Israel's right to exist be mutually recognized and that the PLO, which represents the Palestinian people, participate in the peace process.\n140.\tTUrning now to the situation in Lebanon, it was most gratifying that the efforts of those involved resulted in a ceasefire last July. The Government of Japan, as a sponsor of Security Council resolution 490 (1981) calling for an immediate cessation of all armed attacks on Lebanon, sincerely welcomed that achievement.\n141.\tWe consider it of the utmost importance that that ceasefire be maintained and that international efforts be made to move from that first step towards the solution of the Middle East question as a whole. I should like to appeal to all those concerned to exercise restraint and to refrain from any acts which would destroy the atmosphere in which such international efforts can be made.\n142.\tThe Government of Japan will continue to support strongly the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations, which are playing a vital role in the maintenance of peace in the Middle East. Moreover, it urges all parties concerned likewise to extend their support to those operations.\n143.\tIn June of this year, Israel undertook the outrageous step of bombing an Iraqi nuclear reactor, violating international law and the Charter. That act also constitutes a challenge to the efforts of countries promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy while committed to nuclear nonproliferation. Japan strongly condemns that act and calls on Israel humbly to comply with Security Council resolution 487 (1981), which was adopted unanimously and which represents the minimum demand of world public opinion.\n144.\tDestabilizing situations unfortunately still persist in Africa. That the practice of racial discrimination in South Africa has not yet been eradicated is a particularly serious problem. Japan strongly urges the Government of South Africa to eradicate immediately the policies of apartheid, which run counter to the principles of the Charter.\n145.\tFurthermore, it is utterly deplorable that, owing to the intransigent attitude of the Government of South Africa, free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations have not been held in Namibia, nor has Namibia achieved its independence. Japan reaffirms its view that the question of Namibia should be solved on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and wishes to express its earnest hope that the countries concerned will make further efforts towards an early solution of that problem.\n146.\tJapan has declared its readiness to participate actively in the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group and hopes that the Group will begin its operations and that Namibian independence will be achieved at the earliest possible date.\n147.\tI cannot help expressing deep concern at the current situation of the rapidly increasing number of refugees in Africa. At the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa held in April of this year, Japan declared its intention to extend positive cooperation to that problem. I believe that every country should continue to extend maximum assistance for the relief of those refugees, who are suffering from starvation and disease.\n148.\tBased on the fundamental position of the pursuit of peace and the refusal to become a military power, it is the consistent policy of the foreign relations of my country to contribute to the building of world peace and prosperity. We are determined to work actively for world peace and. prosperity, particularly at this time of global instability. For that purpose, we shall endeavor to promote relations of friendship and cooperation with other countries throughout the world.\n149.\tIn accordance with that policy, my country sincerely hopes to develop relations of friendship and cooperation, based on true mutual understanding, with the Soviet Union, one of its most important neighbors. However, there still exists between the Soviet Union and Japan an unsettled territorial issue. The Northern Territories, reversion of which Japan has always demanded from the Soviet Union, comprise the islands of the Habomai, Shikotan, Kunashiri and Etorofu. It is clear from the historical as well as the legal viewpoint that those islands are not included in the Kurile Islands, to which Japan renounced its title under the Peace Treaty signed at San Francisco on 8 September 1951. A peace treaty has not yet been concluded between our two countries because the territorial issue remains unsettled. This constitutes a major obstacle to the development of our relationship on a stable basis. I must also point out that we have been confronted with an extremely regrettable situation whereby the Soviet Union has recently deployed and strengthened its military forces in the Northern Territories.\n150.\tThe Government of Japan demands that this situation be promptly rectified, and strongly urges the Soviet Union to come to the negotiating table with a view to settling the northern territorial issue and thereby concluding a peace treaty. I firmly believe that further development of relations of true friendship between Japan and the Soviet Union upon the settlement of this issue will contribute to the peace and stability of Asia and to that of the world as well,\n151.\tIncidentally, the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union in his statement today [7 th meeting] made a reference alleging that Japan is getting involved in the establishment of military cooperation between the United States and China. I must state clearly that this is an entirely groundless allegation.\n152.\tIt is my conviction that in order to enhance the stability and prosperity of the international community the United Nations should be utilized in a more positive way as a means of reversing current trends in the world situation. A number of difficulties and limitations certainly confront the United Nations in the actual performance of its functions. We must not forget, however, that the ability of the United Nations to play an effective role in settling the problems before us depends precisely on our attitude as Member States.\n153.\tIn establishing the United Nations mankind entrusted to if its hope for world peace and prosperity. I consider it extremely important today for each Member State to remember this original ideal. In order to revitalize its functions, the role of the United Nations must be considered not in a passive way by asking what can be expected of the Organization but in a positive way by seeking to utilize it effectively in solving problems.\n154.\tI believe that in today's international community, where the interdependence of States and of regions continues to grow, important world problems can never be resolved without international effort. As mankind's only universal international Organization, the United Nations should be utilized in an effective way as a forum for the promotion of such international endeavors.\n155.\tI should like to conclude my statement by appealing not only to the world's most powerful nations but to all Member States to make joint efforts to eliminate the destabilizing elements in the world and thus attain the common goal of lasting peace and prosperity for mankind.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " My first words, Sir, from this podium are addressed to, you in expression of our sincere congratulations on your election to the high office of President of this the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your own long and distinguished service in the field of diplomacy and international relations is a matter of public record. You have served not only in the interests of your own country but also in pursuit of the noble objectives of international endeavor.\n4.\tI recall with particular pleasure the honor we in Guyana had of welcoming you in 1972 as a representative of the Secretary-General to the Conference of Foreign Ministers of NonAligned Countries. Since your return to the service of your country you have contributed to the strengthening of the bonds of friendship between the parties, the Governments and the peoples of Guyana and Iraq a friendship which is enhanced by our joint and cooperative activities as members of the Group of 77, the nonaligned movement and this Organization.\n5.\tThe business of this session promises to be challenging, if not perplexing. We are confident, however, that your skill, your experience, your aplomb and your dedication to the search for just and equitable solutions to the problems which at present beset mankind will be tactfully and maturely applied, to the benefit of the Organization and the peoples here represented.\n6.\tLet me take this opportunity to express as well our thanks and gratitude to Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal\nRepublic of Germany, who, as President of the thirty-fifth session, only recently concluded, applied unremittingly his talents and his energies to the achievement of consensus in the Assembly.\n7.\tWe must specially commend him for his untiring efforts to see launched a global round of negotiations on international economic cooperation as desired by the vast majority of Member States.\n8.\tEqually, I wish to extend to the Secretary-General our deep appreciation for his own consistent and steadfast work directed towards the fulfillment of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n9.\tWith the admission of Vanuatu to our midst, the Organization takes one more step towards its goal of universality of membership. Today we join with others in welcoming this new Member to our ranks. Guyana is convinced that this Republic will make a positive contribution to our work.\n1Q. It was with particular pleasure that Guyana took note of the unanimous decision of the Security Council to recommend acceptance of the application for admission submitted by the newly independent Government of the sister Caribbean country of Belize.The struggle by the Belizean people for their freedom and independence has been long and arduous. Yet even at the very last hour attempts were still being made to frustrate Belize's movement to independence. The Assembly has given constant and unyielding support to the people of Belize in achieving their independence and making secure their territorial integrity. It will be a moment of great joy for the people of Guyana when Belize joins the Organization.\n11.\tThe thirty-sixth session of the Assembly is being held at what may well be a historic crossroads for humanity. It is a moment for reflection on the real values and the present needs of mankind. It is equally a moment to make a projection as to where we go from here, for we seem caught up in the contradiction of extremes. Each hour that we meet, the number of hungry and starving people on this small planet of ours increases. While Saturn and Venus and other distant planets are being explored through the use of a technology which is a wonder indeed, there are people on this earth who spend days to get from one place to another on foot, sometimes in harsh conditions, in search of basic necessities like food, water and fuel. There are enormous extremes of wealth among nations. There are those who are luxuriously housed while others take shelter from the rain in the flimsiest hovels. There are others who remain illiterate while the bounds of knowledge expand continually. And each moment the preparations for war escalate.\n12.\tThe specter of deformation and death due to hunger; and malnutrition, that of disease and deprivation through \nlack of adequate housing, and that of decimation and destruction by conventional and nuclear warfare, even invoked in self-defense, combine to imperil the survival of mankind.\n13.\tAt this particular juncture, we are all aware of serious Negative trends and tendencies in international relations, Increasing turbulence within the international system has led to a pervasive deterioration in political and economic relations. Developments over the past two decades, which had encouraged the hope that principles such as sovereign equality, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and the right of each State to pursue its own path of political, economic and social development were achieving universal acceptance, are now challenged by postures and policies of confrontation, with resultant mistrust.\n14.\tThe nonaligned movement gave a warning about the possibility of the present circumstances at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries, held at Havana in 1979, and more recently at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non1Aligned Countries, held this year at New Delhi.\n15.\tToday there is a generalized mood of fear and foreboding. At the root of this outlook is the recrudescence, in virulent form, of confrontation and conflict, which some believe derive from ideological differences. It is a sad commentary on man's sense of values that, even as international political and economic relations have worsened and the plight of many peoples simple men, women and children has become more desperate, there can be an intensification in the preparations for war and an increase, both globally and within some nations, in the allocation of resources for such preparations.\n16.\tThe drums of war are beating everywhere. As yet; it is largely a war that is conducted through rhetoric by the world's powerful nations. But in some less powerful countries the war dead are being mourned. However, elaborate preparations involve policies which include not only the fabrication and acquisition of even more sophisticated components for an already overstocked war system, but also the threat which stems from the possession of such instruments of war and the determination to use them.\n17.\tThe question arises whether there are States in the various regions of the world which, egged on by the present circumstances, can feel secure in the belief that a recourse to lawlessness will go unpunished or, at worst, will be received with acquiescence by the international community.\n18.\tAlready, the pursuit of such policies has threatened to render asunder the fragile fabric of detente so laboriously constructed. True, it was a detente that was limited in both its geographical application and its substantive scope. But it represented a beginning and was an element in the process of the relaxation of tension and the democratization of international relations. It kept alive the prospect of building relationships of equality and mutual benefit and of expanding the opportunities for global consensus on the solutions of problems which are global in nature.\n19.\tThese developments threaten to negate the efforts which the United Nations has been so laboriously exerting over the years in the field of disarmament to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The overall result is that the world is slowly inching further away from the goal of a secure and lasting peace which the Charter envisages and which is particularly needed in our day. In these circumstances, the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, scheduled to be held in 1982, assumes an important and urgent character. It is our sincere hope that optimum use will be made by other States, particularly the nuclear-weapon States, of the negotiating machinery provided for within the United Nations. It is also our hope that the negotiations will be approached in a positive and constructive spirit, one that will best facilitate the achievement of genuine disarmament. But there are certain crisis situations which antedate the dangers inherent in the present trends and tendencies and remain in need of urgent solutions.\n20.\tIn the decisions taken at the recently concluded eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, devoted to the\\\" question of Namibia, we recorded our determination to maintain the momentum in the march towards universality. In anticipation of the adoption of those appropriate measures as provided for under the Charter, at the present session the Assembly must seek to advance further the cause of Namibian freedom and independence. We must demand that those Members of the Organization that, in one form or another, give succour to South Africa in its continued illegal occupation of Namibia and its acts of aggression against neighboring States join the mainstream of international rejection of the Pretoria racists and their apartheid policies. f\n21.\tThe situation in southern Africa remains a clear threat to international peace and security. In this regard we must not relent in our desire to dismantle the structure of apartheid in South Africa itself.\n22.\tThe search for a lasting solution to the situation in the Middle East requires the reactivation of a more than peripheral involvement of the United Nations. The strategic consensus which the Organization must achieve and implement is one which would ensure for the Palestinians an independent State of their own and allow all States in the region to live in security and peace.\n23.\tLikewise, in Korea the present apparent stalemate must not lead to the reality of permanent division. The wishes of the Korean people for their peaceful reunification on the basis of principles which are well known, including the 10 point program of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea presented by its President Kim II Sung, at the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, must be realized without delay.\n24.\tIn Cyprus, the inter-communal talks must be encouraged, but always within the comprehensive framework which was devised by this Organization and others in 1974 and subsequently.\n25.\tParallel to the turbulence in global political relations, to which I have already alluded, is an international economic system in deep-rooted crisis. It is a crisis from which no individual nation can insulate itself; it is a crisis with fundamental destabilizing consequences for all, especially the already battered economies of many developing countries. These countries continue to confront the twin dilemma of a longterm deterioration in the purchasing power of their commodity exports and a volatility in the prices they obtain from such products on the world market. At the same time, the import prices for essential manufactured and industrial goods from the developed countries show a consistent upward movement.\n26.\tThose of us who attempt to break out of this vicious circle of commodity trade by industrializing face the protectionist barriers that are erected. And some developed\\\" countries are attempting to shift from multilateral cooperation to bilateral exchanges, with deleterious consequences for the capacity of international financial institutions to promote development.\n27.\tCompounding these difficulties is the increasing loss of skilled manpower from the developing countries to those parts of the world that are already highly developed. According to a conservative estimate by UNCTAD, over the decade and a half from 1960 to the mid-1970s, upwards of 420,000 skilled personnel moved from the developing to the developed countries. The skilled personnel that were lost included physicians, scientists, engineers, agricultural experts and other critical professional categories, all trained at immense cost and whose loss has considerably weakened our efforts to develop.\n28.\tThere are some, moreover, who would wish to blame the ills of the poor on ideological preferences, and particularly the choice a country makes between a capitalist or a socialist path to development. There are those, also, who would wish to base their willingness to assist the developing countries according to the latter's choice in a so-called global ideological struggle.\n29.\tI ask: can we with genuine sincerity confront the harsh circumstances of today and the new reality of an interdependent world with the same old dreams, the same old illusions and the same old deceptions? We think not. The positive changes beckoning mankind cannot be contained, nor can we respond by merely clinging to the old economic order.\n30.\tIt is within this context that Guyana expresses regret at the continuing impasse in the NorthSouth dialog. Indeed, the expressed hope of the vast majority or Members of the Organization for the launching of a global round of negotiations has remained just that a hope, We have not advanced much since the near unanimity on the procedures that was achieved at the eleventh special session only last year. We must seek at this session to overcome such barriers as remain to the launching of the global round of negotiations. While such negotiations can lead ultimately to the solution of problems which are structural in nature, many of us are faced with economic problems of both short and medium-term dimensions. These problems require urgent solutions.\n31.\tYet even as lack of progress in the NorthSouth dialog is lamented, there may be a ray of hope on the horizon of economic relations at the global level. I have in mind in particular two developments. In May of this year the HighLevel Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries was held in Venezuela. That conference resulted in substantive decisions of an action-oriented nature designed to strengthen the bases of such cooperation. And there is to be held at\\Cancun in October of this year a meeting at the highest political level of a group of developed and developing countries the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development for informal exchanges on the world economic situation. Guyana hopes that the Cancun meeting will, through the manifestation of the necessary political will, help to give impetus to the search by the international community as a whole for solutions to the problems besetting the world economy, including the launching of the global round of negotiations, and that it will enhance the prospects for international economic cooperation in all its dimensions. We recognize that it presents the international community with an opportunity to demonstrate a breadth of vision and the political will to impart impetus and to lend authoritative direction to the global dialog on economic relations.\n32.\tIt must certainly be to our advantage that this meeting will be taking place against the background of an increasing realization and acknowledgment of the interdependent nature of the world in which we live. Let me hasten to add, however, that the interdependence I speak of is not the one that was born and nurtured in the systemic context of subordination and dependent relationships, for that was an interdependence between the exploiter and the exploited, between the rich man and Lazarus, one which saw the distribution of the results of that relationship shewed in favor of the powerful.\n33.\tA present danger is a lingering desire on the part of some to maintain such a patently unjust relationship. The emerging interdependence, and certainly the one to which we aspire, must be based on the principles of equality and justice and on an equitable distribution of the gains derived from it. We have a dynamic conception of an interdependent world, an interdependence which is symmetrical and based on mutual benefit and mutual respect.\n34.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has now completed its tenth session. Throughout the years of negotiations, all States have had the opportunity of full participation and have contributed to the significant progress which has been made. Indeed, we are at the threshold of concluding a comprehensive treaty. This is why Guyana is concerned that there can be attempts at this late stage to upset a balance so patiently wrought. It is Guyana's lope that ail States will participate in the signing ceremony at Caracas in 1982.\n35.\tIn the finely balanced life support system of this planet, the two most critical areas are those of food and energy. Food production and food security are now matters of universal concern. In his statement before the Committee on World Food Security at Rome in April of this year, the DirectorGeneral of FAO, in alluding to the precarious nature of the global food situation, said that we have to be prepared for the worst not only for this year, but also in the years to come. Indeed, for two successive seasons, as the DirectorGeneral reminded us, the world has consumed more cereals than it has produced. For us, therefore, it seems eminently reasonable to seek international support at all levels for promoting agricultural development, more especially in the developing countries.\n36.\tWe in Guyana have long been embarked on a program of self-sufficiency in food. We have not yet achieved this, but last year, along with Zimbabwe, Guyana was a net exporter of food within the Commonwealth. We intend to accelerate this process. We therefore regard as contradictory, to say the least, the recent positions taken in one of the international institutions, the InterAmerican Development Bank, Dy which Guyana was denied financial resources for increasing its capacity for food production. We cannot understand how there can be on the one hand an expression of an interest in preventing hunger and on the other the adoption of positions which perpetuate that same condition. Guyana remains ready and determined to exploit its potential for agricultural development for the benefit not only of the Guyanese people but also of the people of the Caribbean and even beyond.\n37.\tGuyana has a similar determination in the field of energy. Whereas eight years ago it required less than 10 per cent of Guyana's export earnings to pay for our imported energy needs, today we expend more than 30 per cent of those earnings, and this despite the fact that we have embarked on programs of conservation and have begun to use again alternative but once discarded sources of energy. We in Guyana have been beneficiaries of the generous oil facility established by the sister Caribbean Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. We pay a tribute to the Government of that country for instituting such a program and express our thanks for the assistance. In this regard, we also wish to commend Venezuela and Mexico, which have established an oil facility for the benefit of a number of Central American and Caribbean countries.\n38.\tEveryone knows that energy is critical in the process of development. That is why Guyana participated fully in the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held recently at Nairobi. That is why Guyana is resolved to bring into use its potential for hydro-power and other forms of renewable sources of energy and will resist all attempts, for whatever reason, to frustrate our development in that respect. Guyana will support wholeheartedly all States pursuing similar policies.\n39.\tThere have been other recent developments in my region, Latin America and the Caribbean. Our area has not escaped the vicissitudes and dangers which beset the international community elsewhere! In the quest for independence, its maintenance and consolidation, in the pursuit of economic and social development, change is inevitable in Latin America and the Caribbean, as it is elsewhere. That process takes different forms and moves in different directions, reflecting the difference in history, culture and political norms and experience. As elsewhere, too, there are external attempts to dictate unilaterally the nature of change and to fit it into a prism often at variance with the wishes of the people themselves and detrimental to them. We see some of these processes now at work in our region. Let the Assembly not be seen to be equivocating on the right of the people of our region to fashion their own societies without outside interference.\n40.\tMore generally, the people of Latin America and the Caribbean have increasingly been designing their own regional and subregional institutions with a view to advancing cooperation among themselves. Our attitudes are not autarchic. vVe seek to build bridges of friendship and cooperation not only within our region but also with other peoples and regions. The recent Caribbean Basin initiative can conceivably contribute to the realization of these objectives.\n41.\tThe development of these mutual relations must of course be based on respect for the sovereign right of each of our States to pursue its own political, economic and social development, free from all forms of external interference, coercion, intimidation or pressure. Equally, we. of the Caribbean call for scrupulous respect for the wishes of our peoples for the Caribbean area to be respected as a zone of peace.\n42.\tThere are, however, situations arising within our region itself, some of which contain a clear potential for threatening and indeed disturbing international peace and security. One such situation stems from the present nature of our relations with Venezuela.\n43.\tSeveral years ago the agenda of the General Assembly included an item entitled \\\"Question of boundaries between Venezuela and the territory of British Guiana\\\". The request for the inclusion of that item was made by the Government of Venezuela in 1962,' four years before my country became independent. The purpose of that request was for Venezuela to assert a claim to over two thirds of the territory of my country. It is apposite to note that, four months before taking such action, Venezuela had raised the question in the Fourth Committee, when the independence of my country was engaging the attention of the Organization, then, as now, in resolute pursuit of the goal of total decolonization. Although at that time Venezuela denied that the assertion of its claim was in conflict with its professed support for the independence of my country, the manner in which Venezuela prosecuted its case was tantamount to its making a settlement of its demands a precondition to the attainment of freedom and independence by the Guyanese people. Simply put, an attempt was made to weaken Guyana's urge for independence. With the full and active support of the Organization, however, our objective of independence was achieved on 26 May 1966.\n44.\tEarly this year the Government of Venezuela reasserted its claim to over two thirds of the territory of Guyana. In prosecuting this claim, Venezuela embarked on a carefully orchestrated campaign aimed at the retardation of our economic development and the dismemberment of my country. I was born and bred in a village in the area of Guyana that Venezuela claims. I look forward to retiring there in peace and tranquility. It is a part of Guyana which is rich in resources mineral, forest, agricultural, including fish and livestock and hydro-power, and in which more than one third of our population resides. As I stand before the Assembly, I face the prospect of one day becoming an alien in my own village, a colonial once again, after our uncompromising and successful struggle for independence, or a refugee from the place of my birth. Thousands of people in my country face this specter, this terrible prospect of a return to the condition of colonialism or of exile from their place of birth.\n45.\tI do not wish to burden the Assembly with a detailed analysis of the Venezuelan claim, or the absurdity of its nature; nor, indeed, do I intend to chronicle at this time the legal, historical, political and moral justification for Guyana's position. In brief, towards the end of the last century Venezuela sought and received the support of the Government of the United States of America in placing before an international arbitration tribunal the question of the boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana. Acting fully in accordance with the rules and norms of international law, Venezuela and the United Kingdom in 1897 signed in Washington a treaty which contained their agreement to submit the matter to arbitration procedures\nas a full, perfect and final settlement. Suffice it to say that the Tribunal met and delivered its unanimous judgment on 3 October 1899 in Paris.4\n46.\tIt is on the basis of that award that the boundary between Venezuela and Guyana was finally determined. Indeed, working assiduously between 1901 and 1905, Venezuelan and British commissioners spared no effort to ensure that the boundary on the ground corresponded in every relevant detail to the arbitrary award of 1899. It is that boundary which has given Guyana its present geographic form; we have lived on the basis of that boundary ever since. Incidentally, in 1932 Venezuela participated with the United Kingdom and Brazil in settling the tri-junction point where the boundaries of Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil meet.\n47.\tIn 1962, Venezuela presented its claim to the Organization, contending that the arbitrary award of 1899 was null and void. The weight of Venezuela's evidence rested at that time, as it still does, on the recollections of one of the junior participants in the Paris proceedings, recorded some 50 years after the event and a few months after he had received a decoration at Caracas, and when all the major participants in the arbitration process, had died. There must be speculation as to the true significance of the request by that junior participant that those recollections of his should remain a closely guarded secret until after his death, when he was beyond the reach of questions.\n48.\tAs the records confirm, in keeping with the time honored traditions of the Organization, Venezuela was given a full hearing in the Special Political Committee at the seventeenth session of the General Assembly [348th and 350th meetings]. As a result of the deliberations in that Committee, agreement was reached between Venezuela and the United Kingdom, with the concurrence of the then Government of British Guiana, that in order to dispel any doubt as to the validity of the 1899 award, experts from Venezuela and the United Kingdom should examine the documentary material relating to that award. At that session, the General Assembly limited its action to taking note of what had been agreed on by the parties [119th plenary meeting, para. 40].\n49.\tWhen that consensual position was reached, there was no ambiguity about what was agreed upon, or the nature of the exercise to be undertaken. To make this point pellucid, let it be recalled that the United Kingdom representative said at that time:\n\\\"In making this offer I must make it very clear that it is in no sense an offer to engage in substantive talks about revision of the frontier. That we cannot do, for we consider that there is no justification for it\\\".\nIn recent months, the Government of the United Kingdom has reaffirmed in the British Parliament its position that the arbitrary award of 1899 is valid.\n50.\tThe examination of the voluminous ,documentary material took place between the years 1963 and 1965. We in Guyana remain satisfied that there is not one scintilla of evidence to support the Venezuelan contention of the nullity of the award of 1899. Yet Venezuela maintains its contention.\n51.\tAs our independence approached in 1966\\\", and in order to facilitate the development of friendly relations with Venezuela, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and Guyana concluded an agreement in Geneva.6 That agreement provided mechanisms for ourselves and Venezuela to continue to examine the latter's contention of nullity of the 1899 arbitrary award and to find a practical solution to the controversy which had arisen as a result of that contention. But the ink from the signatures on the Geneva Agreement had hardly dried before Venezuela unleashed a campaign of hostility and aggression against us.\n52.\tIn three successive years, 1967, 1968 and 1969, in the general debate of this Assembly, Guyana had occasion to draw to the attention of the international community repeated acts of pressure, intimidation, subversion and aggression by Venezuela against us. Let me recall two examples: in 1966, only a few months after the conclusion of the Geneva Agreement, Venezuela, through the use of her armed forces, occupied the Guyana part of an island through which our common boundary runs; and 'Venezuela today illegally occupies that part of our territory. In 1968, even as we were engaged in discussion within the framework of the Geneva Agreement, Venezuela, in flagrant disregard of it, sought publicly and privately to discourage investment for development in the region of our country which it claims. And there are many other examples.\n53.\tIt will, therefore, come as no surprise to the Assembly when I report, as I do now, that during the four years which the Geneva Agreement provided for the purpose, Venezuela did not produce any evidence of nullity of the 1899 award. Instead, Venezuela demanded, and sought by all means open to it, a revision of the frontier.\n54.\tVenezuela claims that the 1899 award is null and void, and now denies its very existence. In many formal and official statements, as, for example, a recent letter to the former President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, opposing the involvement of that bank in the development of a hydroelectric project, the Foreign Minister of Venezuela described the 1899 award as \\\"nonexistent\\\".\n55.\tThe Venezuelan record of breaches of the Geneva Agreement is a dismal one. That record notwithstanding, the Government of Guyana did not abandon the search for an end to the controversy, nor efforts to develop friendly and harmonious relations with the people and Government of Venezuela. Thus, in demonstration of our goodwill and our desire to live in peace and harmony with our territory intact, we agreed with Venezuela, in 1970, by the conclusion of a protocol to the Geneva Agreement the Protocol of Port of Spain on an initial moratorium of 12 years during which period there was to be no claim by either party to the territory of the other. Further, it was the jointly expressed hope that there should be intensive efforts to develop and strengthen relations of friendship between the two countries. That development was reported to the Assembly at its twenty-fifth session [1876th meeting paras. 6869].\n56.\tIt is Guyana's view that by and large the Protocol of PortofSpain worked well. Although provision has been made in that Protocol for the automatic renewal of the moratorium, it also contains provisions whereby either \nGuyana or Venezuela could terminate it. Venezuela recently announced its intention to do so.\n57.\tWhen the Protocol of PortofSpain comes to an end on 18 June next year, the parties concerned should return within the ambit of the Geneva Agreement and activate the provisions of Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations.\n58.\tUnfortunately, in signaling its intention not to renew the Protocol, the Government of Venezuela simultaneously embarked on the studied campaign of hostility, pressure and intimidation to which I earlier made reference. Venezuela has also belligerently revived its claim to over two thirds of my country, and has communicated publicly that it will oppose any major effort on our part to develop the resources, particularly a hydro-power facility in the Upper Mazaruni, located in the region of Guyana which Venezuela now claims. In doing so, Venezuela is in clear breach of the provisions of the Protocol of PortofSpain.\n59.\tIn this connection, at the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy held at Nairobi, Venezuela advised the international community that it would not recognize any form of cooperation which would be given for the development of Guyana if such development included the area claimed by it. The Government of Venezuela has also urged the European Community to withhold its participation in the development of the region.\n60.\tThere is a position which Venezuela persistently but erroneously adopts. It is that the Geneva Agreement and the Protocol of PortofSpain, both of which Venezuela has repeatedly violated, repeatedly inhibit us from actively pursuing major development in the area of Guyana claimed by it. That position is juridically untenable. We will not succumb to such pressure. No one can reasonably ask the Guyanese people and their Government to place constraints on their development.\n61.\tIndeed, Venezuela has reneged on an agreement reached on the occasion of the conclusion of the Protocol of PortofSpain in 1970. Under that agreement there was the understanding that each Government would abstain from making any statement, issuing any publication, or committing other acts which would be detrimental to the economic development and progress of each other's State. Guyana has scrupulously adhered to that agreement.\n62.\tThe history of Venezuela's behavior on the question of the frontier with Guyana gives us little cause for optimism. What causes further concern are other policies being pursued by the present Government of Venezuela in that regard. Thus, allied with the desire of that Government to acquire new and sophisticated weapons of war, including F16 fighter aircraft, there are increasingly claimant calls within Venezuela for a military solution to the controversy. 3 would remind the Assembly that the planes used to bomb the nuclear reactor in Iraq were of the same vintage as the F16s which are being purchased by Venezuela. Thus, the purpose of the Venezuelan posture in this regard is to maintain a regime of pressure to bend us to their will.\n63.\tI have deliberately refrained from making this presentation detailed. We have produced a memorandum which amply describes Guyana's position. The delegation of Guyana will, through the established procedures, have that memorandum circulated as an official document of the General Assembly.\n64.\tThe Government and people of Guyana earnestly desire a speedy end to this controversy. We have no other wish than that of establishing a regime of peace, harmony and friendship with the people of Venezuela, with whom we share aspirations for a just and satisfying life and with whom we can together make a contribution to our development and that of our region and our continent, if the Government of Venezuela is of a like mind, then the Geneva Agreement, if henceforth scrupulously respected by Venezuela, can provide such an opportunity. It is oh that basis, and using that approach an approach which I am sure this Assembly will endorse that the Government of Guyana is willing to engage in discussions with Venezuela.\n65.\tThe implications of the Venezuelan claim are serious as much for the future of the relations between Guyana and Venezuela as they are for the future of several States in Latin America, and indeed beyond our region in Africa and in Europe.\n66.\tAs a result of the award of 1899, Guyana lost territory to Venezuela. I ask this rhetorical question: if Venezuela's contention of nullity is valid, is it prepared under those circumstances to entertain on an equal footing a claim by Guyana to territory which is now regarded as part of Venezuela?\n67.\tVenezuela brought the question of our boundary to the United Nations in 1962, at a time when our independence was being considered. We bring it back to the Organization in 1981 to help us maintain our independence and to have our territorial integrity respected.\n68.\tWe have given notice to the 'Assembly of the dangers inherent in the prosecution by Venezuela of its claim. There can be a threat to peace and security, and we have alerted this Assembly to it. Guyana reserves the right to request, if it become y, consideration by the United Nations of the threat which the claim and the manner of its promotion pose. However, we now appeal to the Organization and each and every one of its Members to prevail upon Venezuela to abandon the ill-conceived course of action on which it has embarked for too long.\n69.\tThe complexity of the political and economic crises facing the international community today, and the vast scope of the day-to-day concerns of the world's peoples place the Organization, I suggest, before a challenge which exceeds anything conceived at the time of its creation. The Organization is not perfect. Yet it has effectively over the years helped to mute and contain confrontation in specific areas. Equally, it has played a positive role not only in promoting those principles of a universal character which should guide the actions of Member States, but also in enhancing the prospects and devising appropriate mechanisms for international cooperation on matters of global concern.\n70.\tThe range of problems of increasing concern to individual States, particular regions or groups of States has narrowed. In any event, the interrelationship of issues and the necessity for the successful resolution of conflicts and controversies point to the increasingly global nature of problems and the concomitant imperative of a global approach to solutions. The capacity of the Organization to contribute to these solutions would clearly be enhanced if major Powers and those which act in their image would make their recourse to it less selective and self-serving.\n71.\tI believe that now more than ever we need to optimize the use of the Organization for the fulfillment of its primary purposes. Foremost among these must be, in the words of the Charter, \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". We must resolve to turn back the tide, which is heading towards a holocaust of unprecedented dimensions. We must resolve to embark unremittingly on a program of general and complete disarmament.\n72.\tThe second purpose is the provision of security of food, clothing and shelter for the masses of the world's peoples.\n73.\tFinally, there is the dire necessity to create the conditions for a regime of genuine peace and security. We are increasingly an interdependent world in which survival is dependent on mutual support and on collective action for mutual benefit.\n74.\tThe nonaligned movement has been in the vanguard of international action for the achievement of these goals. It continues to fulfill its vocation as an independent non-bloc factor in international relations, free from competition for spheres of influence and from hegemony and domination. The role of the movement as a force for positive and constructive change in the international system is universally acknowledged. There is now no question of the authenticity of our positions or the legitimacy of our cause.\n75.\tSo successful have we been that instead of the derision which we have attracted in the past there is now the adoption of not-so-subtle stratagems for infiltrating the movement and diverting it to purposes which are not of our making or in our interests. We need to continue to resist these efforts'. Now more than ever we in the movement need to adhere to our principles and to be resolute in our determination to pursue the policy of nonalignment. To those ends the people and Government of Guyana remain irrevocably committed.\n76.\tGuyana believes that when a better world is created by us all through our cooperation and concerted efforts it must be managed by us all in keeping with the standards and qualities befitting our humanity. Even the mightiest and most sophisticated implements of war cannot achieve this, Such armaments can only achieve what they were created for destruction, not only of the weak but also of the powerful and strong.\n77.\tThe developing countries must be encouraged to use the resources, both human and natural, that are available to them for the benefit of their peoples. The development process should be geared towards producing self-reliant nations which can benefit from the reality of independence, not by patterning their development styles after other nations but by a global effort for mutual cooperation and true partnership.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "192.\tMr. President, may I congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I recall with satisfaction that relations between Yugoslavia and Iraq are distinguished by warm friendship and cooperation. We are confident that your vast experience and well-known devotion to the cause of the United Nations will contribute meaningfully to our fruitful deliberations.\n193.\tIt gives me great pleasure to welcome the admission of the Republic of Vanuatu, which has recently gained its independence, to membership in the Organization. Thus a new step has been taken towards complete decolonization, the achievement of which is one of the most noble goals of the United Nations.\n194.\tRarely has there been such concordance in our assessment that the state of international affairs today is very grave and disturbing. During the past year new crises have arisen and the tension between the great Powers has increased. The situation is acquiring dangerous proportions, affecting negatively the international climate as a whole.\t\n195.\tThe relaxation of tensions, negotiation and cooperation based on respect for mutual and common interests are giving way to an ever wider and more frequent use of force, which is being imposed as a rule of international conduct. The , right of peoples to determine their own destiny is being denied. New forms of political and economic domination are threatening to become a chronic illness of international relations.\n196.\tThe world community is again at the crossroads. Peace, security and development are becoming ever more uncertain, as they were in the darkest days of the cold war. It is more than clear that the old order of privileges, monopolies and inequalities, based on the division of the world into blocs, cannot meet the requirements of our time. Not only has it proved its impotence, but it also carries risks for the future of the international community. However, I should like to point out that the peoples have never opposed the policy of force and foreign domination more resolutely than now. Aspirations to independence and equality, as well as the demands for substantial changes in the international order, are an encouraging feature of our time.\n197.\tIf we want to end the present stalemate and ensure lasting peace and progress for mankind, we must search for appropriate answers to the burning questions with which we are faced.\n198.\tIt is our belief that those answers are contained within the alternative offered to the world by the policy of nonalignment. Twenty years of the policy of nonalignment and its role in the international scene have irrefutably confirmed this. The full affirmation of nonalignment as an independent and positive political force has not been due to its military and economic power, but to its moral values. This policy truly reflects the hopes and needs of mankind. Owing to this, and to its comprehensive program of new international relations, it has won followers on all continents and has become a universal policy serving the interests of the entire international community.\n199.\tNo global strategy can yield positive results in She search for a way out of the present situation if it rejects or ignores this program. We hold that that has been confirmed by life itself.\n200.\tLasting peace and security can be achieved only through universal detente that takes into account the interests of all States and enables them to participate on an equal footing in the solving of vital international problems. In other words, detente cannot exist only between the superPowers and their respective military and political alliances, although it would be inconceivable without their participation and responsibilities. World relations cannot be reduced to their mutual relations.\n201.\tThe policy of relaxation of tensions must be clearly directed towards the elimination of all hotbeds of crisis, military interventions and interferences in the internal affairs of States. It must seek the peaceful settlement of disputes, progress in the field of disarmament, and the bridging of the gap between developed and developing countries.\n202.\tIt is important to note that Europe has not been able to avoid the general worsening of the international situation either, which has had adverse effects upon cooperation and security on our continent. We attach great significance to the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, as it is a positive program for life in Europe. There must be constant efforts to implement its provisions.\n203.\tAt the Madrid review session of the Conference, Yugoslavia, with other neutral and nonaligned countries of Europe, searched for means of mutual cooperation beneficial to all. Because of bloc rivalries that could not be achieved, but the hope remains for success when the Madrid meeting resumes its work. We believe it would have a positive impact on the general situation in the world.\n204.\tMy country's dedication to the spirit of Helsinki is a logical result of its foreign policy of nonalignment. In this regard, we also attach the greatest importance to the promotion of good relations with all neighboring countries.\n205.\tNoninterference in internal affairs, and unconditional respect for sovereignty, the inviolability of borders and territorial integrity are cornerstones of this policy. We also consider full recognition of the rights of national minorities to be an important element of mutual confidence and good-neighborly relations. In our view, these principles must be consistently respected in relations among all States, particularly between neighboring States. They should, of course, be applied on a basis of reciprocity.\n206.\tSuch a practice prevails today in the Balkan region. Hie importance of this positive process can best be understood if we recall that not so long ago this area was often referred to as a gray zone between existing power blocs.\n\n207.\tWith regard to the major problems facing the world today, we are of the opinion that their solutions must be sought primarily within the framework of the United Nations. However, there are tendencies to exclude the United Nations from that process, allegedly for the sake of greater effectiveness. We consider that to be completely unacceptable.\n208.\tUndoubtedly, the solving of major problems with the participation of a large number of countries is, like any other democratic process, neither easy nor simple. But it is the only lasting and effective way to reach solutions that will be in accordance with the interests of the world community as a whole. With that in mind, the Yugoslav delegation will again do its utmost to contribute to the success of this session of the General Assembly.\n209.\tWe consider the question of disarmament to be of great urgency. The unprecedented escalation of the arms race has become a dominant phenomenon of our time. Disarmament negotiations have so far failed to produce even a minimal result. Region after region is being covered with medium-range and long-range missile systems. Enormous financial resources are wasted for such purposes. They already equal annually the total debts of all the developing countries. This has the gravest consequences for international relations. In order to curtail that race, it is essential that this session ensure successful preparations for the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\n210.\tToday, nobody can deny that peace, security and the progress of mankind are closely linked to the state of the international economy. True, scientific and technological achievements are supposed to promote faster economic and social progress. Yet there is more hunger today in the world than ever before. The most recent data, as Well as the many international meetings held this year, have clearly confirmed this. A quarter of the total population of the developing countries is exposed to permanent starvation, while another quarter suffers from malnutrition.\n211.\tStill, efforts to establish the new international economic order have so far not produced even initial results. The global negotiations are not yet off the ground. We believe that at this session the necessary political will should be demonstrated to launch those negotiations and thus to pave the way for international cooperation. Progress achieved in this regard would greatly contribute to the creation of a favorable climate for dealing with the acute issues confronting the world. We will welcome any positive demonstration of goodwill and readiness to contribute to that end.\n212.\tIt is important that at this session the Assembly devote the greatest attention to the final elaboration and adoption of the proposed Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States.\\\" That would greatly increase the readiness of nations to resist the use of force in international relations.\n*\n213.\tThe security of the Mediterranean is of the utmost importance not only to the littoral countries, but also to all of Europe as well as to the Middle East. Current developments in the. Mediterranean give us cause for great concern. We are witnessing intensified bloc rivalry, a concentration of armaments and the increased presence of for eight fleets. This calls for constant effort on our part to transform the Mediterranean into a zone of peace and international cooperation.\n214.\tHotbeds of crisis have year after year been high on the agenda of General Assembly sessions. Again we note with concern that those crises are not being settled; on the contrary, they are flaring up. That is due to the continued violation of the basic right of nations to independence and to free choice as regards their own internal development.\n215.\tWe believe that it is clear to everyone today that there is no way out of the Middle East crisis without the withdrawal of Israel from all territories occupied since 1967 and without a solution of the Palestinian question with the participation, on an equal footing, of the PLO. Any just, lasting and comprehensive settlement must include the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self determination and to its own State, as well as the recognition of the right of all countries and peoples of that region to live in peace and security.\n216.\tNeedless to say, partial solutions to the Middle East crisis can be neither just nor realistic. In spite of that, there has been no progress since the last session. The situation has deteriorated, particularly because of the repeated aggression carried out by Israel against Lebanon, which threatens to escalate the war even further.\n217.\tWith all these circumstances in mind, we are deeply concerned by the protracted conflict between Iran and Iraq. We strongly believe that that conflict should be resolved by peaceful means, with full respect for the principles of the Charter and the policy of nonalignment.\n218.\tThe crisis in southern Africa is becoming increasingly dangerous. Despite the endeavors of the great majority of Member States, the United Nations has regrettably not succeeded in achieving independence for Namibia. The aggressive policy of South Africa against Namibia and other front-line States is transforming the whole of southern Africa into a powder keg, with global implications. The latest brazen aggression against Angola is yet another grave warning in that respect.\n219.\tIt is really the crucial moment for justice and political realism to prevail; now is the time to cease any kind of support for and to stop tolerating provocations by the racist regime of Pretoria against its neighboring African States. Such dangerous playing with fire can produce far reaching consequences.\n220.\tIt seems proper to recall the positive contribution made by the nonaligned movement to eradicate finally the last vestiges of colonialism and racism on African soil. Those include efforts exerted at the Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the NonAligned Countries on the Question of Namibia, held at Algiers, at the Security Council and, later, at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly. By their efforts, the nonaligned countries have searched for a just solution and have sounded a warning which should not remain unheeded. We also believe that the five-member contact group, which had presented a plan for Namibia, should itself firmly resist Pretoria's blackmail. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) should unambiguously be reaffirmed as the only possible basis for the urgent and just achievement of independence by Namibia, with the full participation of the South West Africa People's Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. Only thus can peace be brought to the peoples of southern Africa and independence and non alignment in that part of the African continent be strengthened.\n221.\tRemaining colonial problems, anywhere m the world, should be eliminated, since they constitute an unacceptable anachronism. We are also of the opinion that the necessary conditions must urgently be created to enable all peoples whose right to self determination is still denied to decide freely their own destiny.\n222.\tWe support all efforts in that direction. This ap plies equally to the right of the people of Western Sahara and to the search for a just solution based on the decision of the OAU [see A/361534, annex II, resolution AHG/Res. 103 (XVIII)].\n223.\tWe also favor continuation of the dialog on the peaceful reunification of Korea, which corresponds to the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people. We fully support the constructive initiatives by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the solution of that question.\n224.\tRegarding the crises in Afghanistan \\\"and Kampuchea, we continue to support a peaceful political solution, which should be found on the basis of General Assembly resolutions calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops, the elimination of foreign interference and full respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and nonaligned status of those countries.\n225.\tAs far as Cyprus is concerned, we envisage a settlement through the continuation of inter-communal talks and within the provisions of General Assembly resolution 32/15 confirming the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and nonalignment of Cyprus. Yugoslavia has always supported national liberation struggles and the right of peoples to freedom and independence. Those inalienable rights must not be denied to any nation, anywhere on earth, from Africa and Europe to Asia and Latin America, and Central America.\n226.\tThe current session of the General Assembly will consider a number of issues of vital importance for mankind and for peace in the world.\n227.\tThe accumulation of international problems and the exacerbated relations between great Powers threaten to instigate confrontation instead of the constructive cooperation we would like to see at this session. We are afraid that such tendencies would deepen the already existing atmosphere of mistrust and thereby create new difficulties.\n228.\tSo far, on several occasions in critical situations, the United Nations has made a very significant contribution to the consideration of complex international issues and to the lessening of tension in international relations. If all of us here, regardless of which groupings of countries we belong to, exert a joint effort and unite our political will, we could again succeed.\n229.\tSuch an effort certainly calls for a high sense of responsibility, especially on the part cf the great Powers. We must demonstrate our common readiness to meet new challenges and to search together for solutions which would not favor selfish interests but would reaffirm the lofty principles of the Charter, on the basis of which we have joined, together in the Organization.\n230.\tThus we would, despite all the existing difficulties, open new avenues into the future, to a world of cooperation and peaceful coexistence, to economic prosperity and independence and to a life in peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to join my colleagues who have congratulated you upon your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your experience and wisdom will greatly help you in finding solutions to the many problems which will be debated at this session.\n3.\tI should also like to welcome to our Organization a new Member State, Vanuatu.\n4.\tThe SecretaryGeneral and his entire staff have continued with devotion and steadfastness to work at the tasks given them by the United Nations. Allow me to express my thanks for their efforts and to promise to the SecretaryGeneral full support for his ceaseless activities in his important position.\n5.\tWhen the victors in the Second World War met at San Francisco in 1945 to build the foundation of a new and better world, the representatives of all the Member States signed the Charter of the United Nations. Its purposes and principles are to be found in the Preamble and Chapter I, including solemn declarations on fundamental human rights and basic rules for international relations. Since that time representatives of all new Member States have also accepted their obligations under the Charter. We are not a small group of States that have to stand together and resist the transgressions of other powerful States and groups of States when they do not respect the solemn declarations we have made individually and confirmed collectively.\n6.\tThe United Nations is almost universal in membership and the danger from those outside the Organization is minimal. Can we then ask ourselves whether we have not already attained some of the goals set in the original Charter and whether we do not after 36 years have the others within our grasp? I shall let each man answer for himself and I myself shall not attempt now to give a comprehensive answer to those questions.\n7.\tthirty-six years are not a long period in the history of mankind and some of the solemn declarations in the Charter certainly take time to put into practice. However, others need no time, but only the will to live in accordance with the agreement we have all signed, it is the lack of the will to honor those obligations of the Charter that is the main reason for the situation existing today in international relations.\n8.\tIt is almost two years since the invasion of Afghanistan began. We all have fresh in our memory the emergency special session of the General Assembly that was convened for this reason in January 1980. Then an overwhelming majority of all the Member States adopted resolution ES6/2 in which the Assembly confirmed in clear terms that the sovereignty and political independence of all States is a fundamental principle of the Charter of the United Nations, The violation of that basic principle, whatever the pretext, is a breach of the Charter. Therefore, all foreign military forces should be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally. A similar resolution was again adopted by the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly last year, but unfortunately those resolutions have not had any tangible effects.\n9.\tThere has to be respect for the sovereignty and political independence of all States if we are to succeed in lessening the dangerous tensions that exist today in relations between States and in maintaining international peace and security, which is one of the primary purposes of the Organization. All nations, large and small, will have? to work in earnest towards that goal. And 1 refer again to the principles of the United Nations as stated in the Charter. We have to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. There has hardly ever been more reason than there is today to recall these words, to remember them and to try to live up to them.\n10.\tDuring the past few months, European and North American representatives have been meeting at a conference to discuss the follow-up to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. When the Final Act of Helsinki1 was signed in 1975 it was the formalization of the results of the policy of detente, which had been practiced from the latter part of the 1960s. Unfortunately, some of theStates that have participated in the work of the conference have shown a rather limited determination to carry out in earnest certain important elements of the Final Act. However, it is much more serious that faults are beginning to appear in the basis for improved relations: the mutual confidence on which increased cooperation has to be built.\n11.\tThe Madrid conference will reconvene next month. There, all participants have to unite their efforts to strengthen the confidence necessary to promote a policy of genuine detente. If we are successful in building confidence, then it will prove easier to take effective measures to reduce armaments in Europe by negotiating agreements within the framework of a conference on disarmament and security in Europe.\n12.\tThis conference to which I have referred is certainly an important factor in the efforts to reduce armaments in the world. However, it would only be one part of the extremely important field of disarmament and arms control. It is no less important to achieve concrete results in the negotiations soon to be initiated between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic nuclear weapons in Europe. The arsenals of the superPowers are such a great part of the total armaments in the world that there is no hope for disarmament if they are not willing to cooperate. If the super Powers do not agree, there can be no progress in international negotiations, whether in the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, at the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to be held next year, or in the negotiations in Vienna on mutual and balanced force reductions.\n13.\tThe arms race is different from other races in that the faster the pace the greater the probability that all participants will lose. Therefore, the question of security must not revolve around the attainment of military superiority. Increased security must be attained through military balance at the lowest possible level of armaments and forces.\n14.\tMany serious problems will be debated at this session, and most of them have been discussed in the General Assembly for years or even decades, and yet no solutions have been found. Some of those problems have even become more difficult to solve as time has passed. This is notably the case with the developments in the Middle East.\n15.\tThe situation in the Middle East is a constant threat to world peace. That is why our Organization must do everything possible in order to find a solution to the problem. On earlier occasions I have stated what I will reaffirm again here: that a solution to the Middle East problem must be found on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In order to arrive at a comprehensive peace in the area, the right of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries must be respected as well as the legitimate national rights of the Palestinians. And in accordance with the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, they must also participate in negotiations concerning a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problems.\n16.\tIt is regrettable that no changes seem to be in sight in the apartheid policy of the South African Government, and South Africa continues to resist the implementation of the declared policy of the United Nations about the independence of Namibia. To boot, South Africa recently carried out a military attack on Angola. I condemn in the strongest terms this military intervention and call for the immediate and total withdrawal of all foreign military forces, just as I support wholeheartedly the demand for total withdrawal of all Vietnamese invasion forces from Kampuchea where a war torn nation should be allowed to organize free elections. We must constantly insist that all States Members of the United Nations abide by the fundamental principle of refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.\n17.\tWe also have other aims and fundamental principles in the United Nations, future goals that we knew in the beginning would take a long time to reach. And today we are possibly farther away from reaching some of those goals than at the time of the establishment of the Organization. Here I refer to international solutions of economic, social and cultural problems %s well as to respect for human and civil rights.\n18.\tThe development of international economic relations in the past few decades and the serious energy crisis of recent years have made it more necessary than ever before to organize closer cooperation between the industrial and the developing countries. New methods must be found to divide the riches of the earth in order to ease the suffering and scarcity which a great part of mankind endures.\n19.\tMy country is among the fortunate, economically speaking, and the Icelandic people have come to realize more and more our obligations to assist those who are less fortunate with larger contributions towards their development.\n20.\tNext month the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development will be held at Cancun, and recently we held in Paris the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and at Nairobi the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. The problems of the developing countries will also occupy a large part of the debates at the present session of the General Assembly. I should like to express the hope that all the efforts expended in those activities will result in substantive solutions, although it is obvious that the problems are so great that they will not all be solved in a short space of time.\n21.\tIn the Preamble to the Charter, we state that we are determined to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person. To reiterate that determination, we have solemnly proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. With that in mind, it is extremely depressing to have to observe the fact that violations of that fundamental principle of the Charter have become more and more frequent in vast areas of the world. Violence and force are openly used at will by governments, whether to compel individuals, minorities, or entire nations to accept the political opinions of the authorities, their religious beliefs, or whatever pretext they use to force obedience. Imprisonment, torture, and capital punishment have become part of daily life in many Member States, in spite of the clear obligations all of us accepted upon becoming Members.\n22.\tI want to stress here that I consider it one of the main tasks of the United Nations in the immediate future to stop that negative development. We should, rather, use all our collective strength to press for improvements regarding human rights. My Government will wholeheartedly support such efforts. Iceland would want to promote an agreement on the abolition of capital punishment. Iceland would want to conclude the drafting of a convention on the prohibition of torture and, along with the other Nordic countries, actively work for the final adoption of the Nordic proposal submitted to the Commission on Human Rights to establish a universal fund for the victims of torture.\n23.\tBefore closing, I must refer to one field of the work of the United Nations one which my country has long considered among the most important. Here I am referring to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, dealing with two thirds of the surface of the earth. When I addressed this Assembly at its last session [5th meeting], I thought the prospects for finally concluding the drafting of a treaty which all nations of the world would accept and sign were bright. Unfortunately, there are now clouds on the horizon which, if worst comes to the worst, could preclude the wide international support necessary if the convention is to serve its intended purpose, i.e., to ensure the application of international law in that large area of the globe and prevent disputes which might endanger good neighborly relations and international peace.\n24.\tI should like to use this opportunity to urge the representatives of all nations present here to do their utmost to ensure that all nations of the world can sign a new Convention on the law of the sea next year. If we succeed in that endeavor, we will have shown what our nations can achieve if they stand united, as the United Nations should.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, allow me to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, which I am convinced will successfully accomplish its task under your guidance,\n2.\tI also wish to welcome the delegations of the Republic of Vanuatu and Belize, the newly admitted Members of the world Organization.\n3.\tEvery session of the General Assembly is a significant event in international political life. This is particularly true now when the process of detente has suffered a set-back and elements of tension in international relations are on the increase. The intensification of negative processes which have been observed in recent years threatens to confront mankind anew with the grave consequences of the cold-war policy that once caused so much damage.\n4.\tThe main cause of unfavorable developments in the international situation lies in the attempts to push the world back Into the impasse of the policy of force by starting i new surge in the arms racc in pursuit of military superiority and by poisoning the international atmosphere. I know very well that other factors ate also mentioned as being at the root of international tension, but these ate mere pretexts used by extremist imperialist circles to conceal their true intentions.\n5.\tThe policy of those circles is aimed at destroying the results of detcnte. Systematic efforts are being made to undermine relations between socialist and developed capitalist countries. Before our very eyes, military and economic power is being used increasingly against countries pursuing progressive policies and against liberation movements. Efforts are being made to provoke confrontation, to exacerbate the situation and to create new hotbeds of crisis. Cold war propaganda campaigns have gained further momentum.\n6.\tIt is no exaggeration to say that all these ingredients combine to create a serious danger to peace and international security and cooperation among States and peoples which statesmen have, with a proper sense of responsibility for the fate of mankind, made untiring efforts to bring about and strengthen for decades. It is in the common interest of peoples everywhere to call a halt to those processes, jeopardizing as they do international peace and security.\n7.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic condemns attacks on detente, the arms race and irresponsible attempts to poison the international climate and revive the cold war. The prime goal of our foreign policy remains that of promoting the cause of averting the danger of war, strengthening peace and international security, achieving disarmament and deepening friendship and cooperation among peoples.\n8.\tIn the present situation we believe it to be of particular importance to maintain and reinforce the links which countries with different social systems have forged over the last few years in a spirit of peaceful coexistence. In so far as possible, international co-operation should continue to be developed, efforts to solve outstanding problems should be redoubled and any designs to impede or restrict, the achievement of such goals should resisted.\n9.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic is a staunch advocate of disarmament and of arms limitation. My Government participates actively and constructively in the different international disarmament forums and endeavors to promote solutions for the issues Involved through bilateral talks as well.\n10.\tIn the present-day international situation, all peoples of the world have a particular Interest in, and face the most important task of, halting the arms race, which is placing increasingly heavy burdens on mankind. At previous disarmament talks, a considerable number of valuable and constructive proposals were put forward and agreements were concluded. It Is important that the results of past efforts should not be wasted and should be drawn upon to achieve practical accords that would lead to a reduction of military confrontation. Renewed and mutual initiatives arc necessary for further serious steps to be taken by the world along the road to disarmament. We therefore welcome and support the Soviet disarmament proposals, including that of the addition of the most recent item on the agenda of the current session [AI36/I92], relating to the conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space.\n\nThese proposals are based on sober consideration, taking realities into account. They reflect an earnest desire for peace and consequently coincide will the interests and\naspirations of the Hungarian people\n11.\t The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic attaches particular importance to the cause of nuclear disarmament and great significance to the continuation of\ttalks, which are so crucial to the security of all mankind,\tbetween the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation and reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.\n12.\tThe failure to ratify the SALT II agreement, the slowing down or discontinuance of the disarmament negotiations by tho American side and the implementation of\tparticular attention to the promotion of\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NVATO] decision\tnot a mere expression which can be struck out of decision to deploy American medium-range strategic nuclear missiles in certain Western European countries, which a direct threat to the security of my own country, serves to increase international tension, disturbs the existing balance of power and further escalates the arms race.\n\n13.\tNot long ago we were shocked to learn the news of\nthe latest American decision to start manufacturing the\tneutron bomb. The emergence of that particularly inhumane weapon of moss destruction in the military arsenal is a consequence of the fallacious doctrine that proclaims\tthe possibility of a limited nuclear war and brings closer the danger of a nuclear holocaust. It is destined to\tbring about a new wave of nuclear armament and to reduce the chances of success of disarmament talks. We therefore have every basis for demanding that the neutron bomb be outlawed.countries,\n\n14.\tWe warmly welcome the draft declaration submitted\tproducing mutually acceptable agreements on ,the basis of to the General Assembly by the Soviet Union [Al36124 annex], whereby the first use of nuclear weapons would be considered a crime against mankind. We believe that the General Assembly should adopt such a declaration on the prevention of nuclear catastrophe.\n15. The Hungarian Government wishes to assure theAssembly of ifs total support for the various proposals for the creation of nuclear-free zones. We endorse the idea of converting northern Europe, the Balkans and tho Mediterranean into denuclearized zones, furthermore we hope\nthat other regions of Europe too will be transformed in nuclear weapon-free zones.\n16.\tMy Government believes that it is necessary to con-\tno substantial progress towards removing the hotbeds of continue efforts to prohibit new types of weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons and to limit conventional weapons. It is our earnest hope that at this session with the consent of all interested parties, decisions will be\t adopted that will help to move the disarmament talks out\nof deadlock. It is our conviction that, given the necessary\tpolitical will, progress in that direction is possible.\n17.\tWe regret that while the arms race is being stepped\tup no positive response has been received to any disarmament proposals, formulated with due regard to mutual interests, that the socialist countries have presented in various forums. A grave historical responsibility is assumed by those who no need to the proposals of the socialist countries.\n18. An important task for the Assembly at the present session is the preparation of the second special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament schedule for 1982. We expect that the efforts being exerted towards the intensification of disarmament talks will be encouraged by that session and even by its preparatory phase. In our view the second special session on disarmament should concentrate on the elaboration of concrete measures designed to restrain the arms race and effectively to promote the cause of disarmament: it should prevent problems of secondary significance being pushed into foreground of the discussion.\n19. The Hungarian People's Republic continues to pay particular attention to the promotion of detente. Detente is not a mere expression which can be struck out of dictionaries if it is not liked, but living process expressing the will of peoples. We believe that detente should continue to play a decisive role in maintaining peace and strengthening security, consolidating peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and expanding mutually beneficial cooperation.\n20. As regards the cause of security and cooperation in Europe, the Hungarian Government has consistently striven to develop its international cooperation in the spirit of the Final Act of Helsinki. Hungarian diplomacy is taking an active part in the Madrid meeting of representatives of States signatories to the Final Act and is tirelessly persevering in its efforts to contain tendencies towards confrontation and to maintain a business like spirit in all deliberations. Together with a number of other countries, the STates members of the Warsaw Treaty are working towards conducting a constructive dialog and producing mutually acceptable agreements on the basis of the Helsinki principles.\n21. We earnestly hope that the Madrid meeting will conclude its work by adopting a meaningful and balanced final document imbued with a sense of responsibility for the destiny of the peoples of the world. We believe it to be of extreme importance that a decision be taken to convene a conference on military detente and disarmament in\nEurope as that would make it possible to seek sensible\ncompromises In adopting certain confidence-building measures and solving disarmament issues.\n22. One of the major reasons for the present state of international tensions is that in the recent years there has been\nno substantial progress towards removing the hotbeds of\ntensions in different parts of the world. The latest international\nevents have once again placed renewed emphasis on the need to eliminate local conflicts, to eliminate hotbeds of crisis and to-prevent the emergence of new ones.\n23. In recent years tension and the danger of armed\nconflict in the Middle East have become chronic. Israel\u2019s\narmed aggression against Lebanon, its threats of war\nagainst Syria, its piratical attack on Iraq and the provocations\nof its air force against Libya are all evidence that\nthe Government of Israel and the imperialist forces backing\nIt ale attempting IO keep the Middle Fast crisis aIivc.\nIt would appear that they want to exploit the complex situation\nthen: In order to establish American military bases.\nAll this makes it even more evident that the separate Camp David deal is totally useless for the settlement of existing problems.\n24.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic favors a comprehensive and just settlement of the Middle East crisis and for the establishment of a .lasting peace in the region. It has taken a stand of solidarity with the just struggle of the Arab peoples and considers that complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied Arab territories, respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to establish an independent State of Palestine and international guarantees for the security and independence of all the States of the region are absolutely indispensable. This is in keeping with the interests of the States and peoples of that area as well as of international peace and security. My Government is of the view that the present session of the General Assembly should contribute towards convening an international conference capable of settling the acute crisis in the Middle East with the participation of all interested parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PL0].\n25.\tImperialist circles have created a dangerous situation in the area of the Persian Gulf and, more broadly, throughout the entire Indian Ocean basin. In that region, where a considerable part of the world's oil resources is to be found, peace, security and stability are of particular importance. What is needed is not a show of military force, but agreements that guarantee peace and security. We regret that the leading Western Powers reject the concrete proposals of the Soviet Union concerning a settlement of the situation and are impeding the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [General Assembly resolution 35/150].\n26.\tThe improvement of the international situation as a whole and the normal development of inter-State relations and co-operation is being hampered by collaboration between imperialist circles, the hegemonists of Peking and other elements to keep the so-called questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea artificially on the agenda. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic believes that the termination of outside intervention in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan is an indispensable prerequisite to the elimination of the dangerous situation around that country. We support the Afghan Government's proposals for a settlement of 24 August 1981 [A/36145] as providing a good basis for a political solution. Any settlement plan that seeks a decision on Afghanistan without the participation of the legitimate Government of th'U country and refuses to recognize the sovereign and Inalienable right of the Afghan people to settle its own affairs is unrealistic and unacceptable.\n27.\tThe policy of China, guided as it is by hegemonistic designs, has given rise to serious complications in IndoChina and South-East Asia. The Hungarian Government is in solidarity with the countries of IndoChina and supports their constructive proposals to restore tranquility in the region and to transform South-East Asia into a zone of peace and stability and multilateral cooperation among States. It is desirable that the dialog which is getting under way among the countries of South-East Asia on the basis of peaceful political initiatives by three countries of IndoChina should produce positive results. We are convinced that recognition of the existing political realities is the only correct path to follow in securing peace and stability in the area.\n28.\tWe take great satisfaction in the fact that the efforts, of the Kampuchean people, which has suffered a terrible tragedy, have produced significant results in the reconstruction and consolidation of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Keeping the so-called question of Kampuchea on the agenda of various international forums only serves imperialist and reactionary interests, The prestige of the world Organization is not enhanced by the fact that the rightful place of the People's Republic of Kampuchea is still being occupied by the Pol Pot clique which represents no one.\n29.\tAmong the factors preventing any improvement in the international situation, I should mention the long-outstanding question of Korea. My Government is unswerving in its solidarity with the struggle of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and supports its efforts to bring about the peaceful reunification of that country.\n30.\tMy Government shares the justified concern already voiced by several speakers over the mounting economic, political and military pressure being exerted by Imperialism and international reaction on the developing countries and the national liberation movements. I should like to declare in this forum that my Government supports the struggle of peoples for social progress, national independence and self-determination, and against colonial oppression and neo-colonialist ambitions. Our position concerning the situation in southern Africa, the policy of apartheid. Western Sahara and the revolutionary processes in Latin America is. guided by that same spirit.\n31.\tWe believe that the States Members of the United Nations should take much more effective measures than they have done so far with a view to the final elimination of the vestiges of colonialism and to ensuring the exercise by all peoples of their right to self-determination. One of the most urgent tasks is to ensure Namibia's accession to independence. My Government supports the Namibian people in its struggle for independence waged under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SHMFO], its sole legitimate representative, against the South African occupiers. My Government maintains that the United Nations should put its earlier resolutions into effect by immediately ending the Illegal occupation of. Namibia, and ensuring the Territorial's real independents.\n32.\tWe condemn the acts of aggression by the Government of South Africa against neighboring countries. Those acts pose a threat to international peace and security. We consider it to be particularly outrageous that the army of the racist regime has penetrated deep into Angolan territory, thus trampling underfoot international law and the principle of national sovereignty, The world Organization has a duty to adopt and apply sanctions against the aggressor.\n33.\tMuch disquieting news is coming in from Central America. With American assistance the military junta is out to crush the struggle of the patriots who represent the interests of the Salvadorean people; Imperialist pressures ate mounting on democratic Nicaragua also. Cuba has become to target of dally propaganda attacks by the United States. We believe that the right of peoples to self-deter-urination Is applicable also to the American continent and no one is entitled to Intervene in the internal affairs of other countries or to determine the course of their development.\n34.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic continues to maintain a profound interest hi the unhindered development of international economic co-operation. My Government seeks to promote the development of International economic relations, the removal of obstacles to co-operation, the elimination of unequal relations and the establishment of a just and democratic international economic order. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic supports and encourages the lawful economic demands of developing countries. The Hungarian People's Republic regards developing countries as Important economic partners enjoying equal rights in every respect. We are ready to participate in the vigorous development of economic, commercial, scientific and technological co-operation with them on a mutually advantageous and long-term basis. At the same time, I believe it is important to stress that we are also striving for a universal solution to the problems of the world economy, including the elimination of those factors which hinder the development of East-West economic relations. .\n35.\tI have attempted in this way to present the views of my Government on certain questions relating to the current international situation and to Indicate our priority concerns in foreign policy. It is true that the processes which are now at work in world politics give little ground for optimism. However, our hopes are based on our conviction that the forces which are interested in maintaining peace and co-operation among States will ultimately prevail over attempts at confrontation. It is our belief that the prevailing situation of tension is temporary in character and that the community of. nations will find itself able to return to fruitful relations and International co-operation for the benefit of all. lb that end my country is willing to combine its efforts with those of other countries which pursue realistic policies. It is in that spirit that the Hungarian delegation is ready to take an active part in a constructive discussion of the problems on our agenda and to take the necessary initiatives in a search for new solutions.\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is a tribute to your outstanding qualities as a diplomat and to your vast experience, and it augurs well for the success of the work of this body, which most clearly represents international public opinion. Please allow me to congratulate you most warmly on behalf of the Greek delegation and on my own behalf.\n36.\tThe outgoing President, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, has earned the gratitude of the Assembly for the exemplary way in which he guided its discussions, for his constructive initiatives and for the prestige which he has won for his important office.\n37.\tWe also wish to extend our congratulations to the SecretaryGeneral, who has once again during the past 12 months demonstrated the greatest dedication to his mission, thus winning for himself the confidence and esteem of all.\n38.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to welcome the delegations of the Republic of Vanuatu and of Belize, young countries which, we are convinced, will play a constructive role in the great family of nations.\n39.\tThe acting President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, Lord Carrington, has expressed [8th meeting] in a succinct and eloquent way the views of the 10 members on the principal problems at the heart of the present international situation. Greece, of course, fully supports that presentation. Please allow me, however, to describe the position of my own Government on a few questions of more particular interest to my country.\n40.\tFirst of all there is the problem of the Middle East, a region of which we are very much aware both because of its geographical proximity and because of the links which for so many centuries have united us to most of the peoples inhabiting it. Unfortunately, the tensions in that region so crucial to world peace, far from diminishing, have persisted and even worsened.\n41.\tIVvo events, above all, have caused a deterioration of the situation: the destruction of the nuclear reactor at Tamuz by the Israeli Air Force and the violent bombings of Beirut and other parts of Lebanon which, because of the loss of life and the material damage caused, have given a new magnitude to the escalation of violence. These are facts which, far from contributing to the success of peace efforts in the Middle East, have fueled distrust and perpetuated confrontation.\n42.\tThe prolongation of the ArabIsraeli conflict and the failure of all unilateral attempts to resolve it demonstrate that only dialog among the parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], can lead to a just and lasting solution. Our Organization has defined the guidelines for such a solution in several resolutions: first, the withdrawal from Arab territories occupied as a result of the wars of 1967 and 1973 and, secondly, the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, as well as of Israel's right to secure and recognized borders. The existence of the PLO is an undeniable reality, as is the fact that that organization represents the Palestinian people which, just like any other people, has a right to create its own State. The State of Israel is, likewise, a reality and has a right to exist within borders which everyone, including itsArab neighbors, recognize and respect.\n43.\tIn this context, there is a need to stress the responsibility of countries that have special weight in world affairs or that have particular links with any party to the conflict, that is, the responsibility of those countries to exert all their influence to make it possible for negotiations to begin.\n44.\tBefore concluding my comments on this question, 1 should like to say a few words about Lebanon, a country which has attracted general sympathy because of the misfortunes afflicting it simply because it finds itself at the center of a conflict with which it is only indirectly concerned. Greece affirms its support for all resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly which demand respect for the independence, territorial integrity and internal order of Lebanon and which affirm the right of the Lebanese Government to restore its authority throughout its national territory.\n45.\tIn Namibia also, prospects for a negotiated settlement have diminished since the thirty-fifth session. The failure of the pre-implementation meeting at Geneva, owing to South Africa's intransigence, has given rise to serious doubts about the possibility of an agreement in the near future on the accession of the Territory to independence. Yet, the basis for a satisfactory and viable settlement does exist and, moreover, has already been accepted by SWAPO and the front-line countries as well as by South Africa. It consists of the full application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which provides for free elections under United Nations supervision. It goes without saying that all Namibian political forces should be enabled to participate in such elections. Moreover, conditions must be created to enable the different ethnic groups of the Territory to live in harmony. This will strengthen the feeling of security in the region.\n46.\tIn the search for a peaceful solution in Namibia, the initiative of the five Western countries which form the contact group is of particular importance. Greece extends its full support to that initiative and hopes that the five countries will see fit to persevere in their efforts, always on the basis of resolution 435 (1978), of which they are the authors.\n47.\tA factor related to the Namibian problem which affects peace and stability throughout southern Africa is the continuation of armed incursions by South African forces into the territory of neighboring countries, especially Angola. These incursions have recently assumed truly\nalarming dimensions. It is clear that if any country whatsoever were to claim the right to police an entire region, we would no longer be able to speak of international order, but rather of the law of the jungle. This is further food for thought for the Organization.\n48.\tAnother international crisis of serious concern to my Government is that of Afghanistan. The presence of Soviet troops in that country is fraught with consequences that we cannot accept. The United Nations, which has on many occasions expressed its views on this subject, must continue its efforts to arrive at a political solution, which, as for any dispute of this nature, must take into account the* basic principles of the Charter, that is, respect for the independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan and recognition of the right of its people to be sole master of its destiny.\n49.\tThe same principles should serve as a starting point for the settlement of the problem of Kampuchea: withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and a free expression of the will of the Khmer people under United Nations supervision. It is time for that unfortunate people, which has suffered so much in the course of two wars and under the ' cruel regime of the years 1975 to 1978, to reap at last the fruits of a peaceful existence and dedicate itself to the enormous task of national reconstruction.\n50.\tThe conflict between Iraq and Iran has lasted for more than a year. We hope it will be resolved without delay by means of negotiations. It would in fact be inconceivable for those two developing countries, members of the nonaligned movement, to continue a war from which neither can benefit.\n51.\tWhile mentioning the nonaligned movement, I should like to reiterate from this rostrum the best wishes of my Government on the occasion of its twentieth anniversary. In the course of its 20 years of existence the movement has gathered together countries of different political and socioeconomic systems which have a common denominator: the desire to remain separate from blocs and to contribute to detente and understanding among peoples. This is a highly commendable aspiration in which we hope they will persevere.\n52.\tThis review of the international situation, however brief, would not be complete without a reference to my country's determination to contribute as much as possible to the successful conclusion of the work of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Limited progress has been achieved thus far at Madrid. My Government remains committed to the Final Act of that Conference, signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975, and hopes that the countries participating in the Conference will make every effort to ensure that a comprehensive and balanced final text is adopted.\n53.\tI should now like briefly to review a few questions which I believe are of universal interest. I shall begin with the problem of apartheid, in order to express once again our repugnance at that degrading regime which constitutes an affront to mankind.\n54.\tApartheid is an extreme case of violation of human rights. It is not the only one. In a number of countries individuals are arbitrarily deprived of their fundamental freedoms, torture is practiced systematically, and persons\ndisappear without trace or are illegally detained. Each year thousands of such cases become known to the world public, and an equal, if not larger, number of violations of this kind never become known beyond the borders of the countries where they are committed.\n55.\tThis is a situation in which we can take no pride. However, the task is not easy. Too often Governments invoke the principle of noninterference in their internal affairs to refuse any monitoring, any cooperation with the competent organs of the Organization. Therefore we must remain ever watchful and give human rights the broadest possible definition: not only the right to choose one's leaders freely, to express oneself freely and to practice the religion of one's choice, but also the right to a basic standard of living, one's own culture and one's own personal ethics.\n56.\tThe economic development of all countries, but above all of those which for various reasons are deprived of a satisfactory standard of living, has become increasingly the responsibility of the Organization. This is a source of gratification. In fact the close link that exists between the major economic problems of our day makes it impossible for us to consider the wellbeing of any particular country or economic entity as an isolated case. That is why we welcome the idea of dealing with the great economic challenge by means of negotiations open to all Member States.\n57.\tIt was not possible for the global negotiations to begin this year, as we had at one time hoped. We do not wish to underestimate the causes of this delay. It is natural that the Governments, especially those which in the final analysis will be called upon to contribute most to the common effort, should be given time for reflection in order to weigh the implications of the commitments they will be asked to undertake, but they must act quickly. The negotiations themselves will not prove easy, and this is one more reason why they should not be delayed. The millions of children whose growth may be arrested because of inadequate nutrition will not forgive us for our failure.\n58.\tGreece, a maritime country par excellence, believes in the need to conclude without further delay a convention which covers all the aspects of the law of the sea and is acceptable to all countries, large or small. Without such a convention mankind may soon be faced with chaos. I hope that this fact will be recognized by all and that all the parties concerned will show moderation and a spirit of cooperation, which are so necessary if we are to arrive at a convention for which the international community has been working for over 10 years.\n59.\tI could conclude my statement on that note if it were not for a problem of particular importance to all Greeks, a problem which has the sad privilege of being one of the oldest in the agenda of the Assembly and which in the course of recent years has not advanced a single step towards a solution. As you may have guessed, I am referring to the problem of Cyprus.\n60.\tThe situation has remained unchanged during the past 12 months. A considerable part of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus is still occupied. The refugees, approximately one quarter of the population, /continue to live far from their homes, and the fate of. some 2,000 persons who disappeared remains unknown.\n61.\tI should like first of all to say a few words on the missing persons. Following lengthy negotiations, the two parties agreed on the establishment of a committee of inquiry, which began its work a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, from the outset the work of that committee met with procedural difficulties. Hence, I should like to make an appeal for the committee to begin its work without further delay and report on the fate of the missing persons, thus putting an end to the anguish of their families.\n62.\tAs for the inter-communal talks, after having registered no progress for long months, some progress has finally been achieved through the introduction of TUrkish Cypriot proposals on the territorial aspect of the problem. However, although these proposals are a small step forward, they cannot be considered a substantial contribution to a successful dialog.\n63.\tFor its part the Government of Cyprus, in spite of justifiable disappointment, has made reasonable proposals on the constitutional aspect reasonable because they are consistent with the notion of a unified State within which the two communities could live in harmony and with equal rights.\n64.\tThere can be no doubt that the respective positions are still far removed from each other. The SecretaryGen eral and I wish to take this opportunity to thank him and his Special Representative for their tireless efforts  while noting this fact in his report, has expressed his intention to undertake an initiative to make it possible to bring the divergent views closer together [see AI36I1, sect. IV\\. We trust him to seek with his wisdom and customary skill the best way of making a contribution to the common effort at this crucial point in the dialog.\n65.\tThat is the situation at the beginning of the thirty- sixth session. A few days ago [12th meeting] my colleague from Cyprus assured us from this rostrum of his Government's desire to continue the dialog. We hope that this desire is reciprocated. We are convinced that a solution can emerge from the inter-communal talks if they are conducted in a constructive spirit and with the genuine political will to arrive at a solution acceptable to all.\n66.\tAs far as my Government is concerned, it is prepared to support any solution consistent with the principles of the Charter, General Assembly resolutions and the genuine interests of the two communities.\n67.\tThe case of Cyprus may prove to be the touchstone of the United Nations. It is the case of a small country which has placed all its hopes for survival in the Organization. If the United Nations were not to succeed in ensuring that the rule of law prevails it would be failing in a fundamental duty.\n68.\tForce has for too long governed the world. It is high time for it to yield to justice and reason. The ideals most cherished by mankind since the beginning of civilization have found expression in the Charter. It is up to all of us to see to it that they are not reduced to meaningless words.\n69.\tI should like to conclude with this marvellos sentence from Saint Exupery. \\\"Only the spirit can breathe life into clay and make it man.\\\"\n\n"

        "file_text": "50 Mr. President, on behalf of Venezuela and of my Government, I sincerely congratulate you on the honor of having been elected President of the General Assembly. Your personal qualities and experience as representative of Iraq are an assurance of correct and effective action.\n51.\tI should also like to pay a cordial tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Ridiger von Wechmar, whose composure has earned him the affection and respect of the Organization.\n52.\tI am also pleased to welcome Vanuatu, which this year participates in the work of the Organization, and with which Venezuela will work closely towards the common objectives of peace, progress and social justice.\n53.\tTo me as a Venezuelan, and as Constitutional President of Venezuela, addressing this gathering represents the embodiment of the admirable and grandiose foresight of The Liberator, Simon Bolivar, the 200th anniversary of whose birth we shall celebrate on 24 July 1983.\n54.\tWhen Bolivar conceived the still unrealized dream of Latin American integration, of \\\"forming a single nation from the entire New World\\\", he wrote:\n\\\"How beautiful it would be if the Isthmus of Panama were to us what the Isthmus of Corinth is to the Greeks. Would to God that we may some day have the good fortune to convene there an august assembly of the representatives of republics, kingdoms and empires to deliberate upon the high interests of peace and of war with nations from three-quarters of the globe. This type of organization may come to pass in some happier period of our regeneration. . .\n55.\tThirty-six years of United Nations life have led to the identification of its pathway, the consolidation of its perspectives and the evaluation of its achievements and failures.\n56.\tThose years have seen much progress in terms of decolonization and the furthering of human rights. World political geography has a new design; the traditional great empires have disappeared. None the less, power politics, cruel and covert, have made themselves felt in the life of this institution, but the constant labor of the small countries has given it an authentic being of its own.\n57.\tThe last decade bears witness to a. growing distortion of the ends, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and the reality of a world in which the dizzy kaleidoscope of events damages those principles.\n58.\tMany peace-keeping efforts have been made in this forum, and we must overcome great difficulties for this institution to contribute effectively to the achievement of a true peace.- The evils threatening mankind are not invincible, and hope in the United Nations is far from vanquished.\n59.\tThe peoples of the world are anxious for the truth, for the abolition of pious lies. They seek authenticity and turn aside from hegemonic pretenses disguised as ideological crusades. Nations previously colonized from without do not now wish to be colonized from within. They not only want to be recognized and known as independent; they wish to be and know themselves to be non- dependent.\n60.\tThe ideal of this Organization is to \\\"save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". Article 4 of the Charter allows as Members only \\\"peace-loving states\\\". For the same reason, a collective security system was established to prevent and control aggression.\n61.\tYet aggression occurs frequently, shamelessly, undisguisedly. Responses to such aggression are barely formal resolutions devoid of concrete substance, or may simply not even reach the level of operative recognition of the Organization, which often seems to have eyes so as not to see.\n62.\tHow long can this breach between principles and facts be maintained?\n63.\tOne of the bases of the United Nations is respect for the self-determination of peoples. Memorable General Assembly resolutions have bravely and rightly developed that principle, but solemn words alone do not become practical effectiveness.\n64.\tManifest examples and subtle evidence of the absurd policy of blocs abound. On behalf of that policy of force, interventions occur with the intention of imposing or maintaining given political regimes leaning towards one ideology or another, or intervention is threatened, to intimidate with the force of arms.\n65.\tIn 1945, the founding Members of the United Nations proclaimed our will \\\"to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples\\\".\n66.\tWe committed ourselves \\\"To achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character\\\".\n67.\tIn that regard, reality has led us over very different and overwhelmingly opposed paths.\n68.\tThe gap between the more developed and the poorer countries has widened. Material resources of the latter group, usurped or acquired at ignoble cost, have served to develop the industrialized nations.\n69.\tIn his Encyclical of 14 September 1981, \\\"Human Work\\\", His Holiness John Paul II bravely denounced that deplorable reality: \n\\\"... the highly industrialized countries, and even more the businesses that direct on a large scale the means of industrial production (the companies referred to as multinational or transnational), fix the highest possible prices for their products, while trying at the same time to fix the lowest possible prices for raw materials or semi-manufactured goods. This is one of the causes of an ever increasing disproportion between national incomes. The gap between most of the richest countries and the poorest ones is not diminishing or being stabilized but is increasing more and more, to the detriment, obviously, of the poor countries. Evidently this must have an effect on local labor policy and on the worker's situation in the economically disadvantaged societies. Finding himself in a system thus conditioned, the direct employer fixes working conditions below the objective requirements of the workers, especially if he himself wishes to obtain the highest possible profits from the business which he runs (or from the businesses which he runs, in the case of a situation of 'socialized' ownership of the means of production).\\\"\nHe adds:\n\\\". . . it is respect for the objective rights of the worker every kind of worker: manual or intellectual, industrial or agricultural, etc. that must constitute the adequate and fundamental criterion for shaping the whole economy, both on the level of the individual society and State and within the whole of the world economic policy and of the systems of international relationships that derive from it.\\\"\n70.\tIndifference, dehumanization and selfishness influence those who refuse even the most modest cooperation in reasonable plans for participation and for redistribution of wealth on the world level, adopting increasingly restrictive policies protective of their own markets, using capital and technology to bend the sovereign will of others and not hesitating to disrupt institutions and Governments which oppose their designs of economic dominance.\n71.\tA difficult world environment hinders the third world's efforts and the capacity of its individual nations to apply policies with a social content.\n72.\tOur countries demand that perspectives of independent development be allowed; that our efforts be permitted to result in full and integral well-being.\n73.\tIn a year which has imparted many lessons, Venezuela presided over the Group of 77. The North-South dialog faces difficult circumstances. Venezuela was honored to host the High-Level Conference on Economic cooperation among Developing Countries, and to have our capital as reference point in the Program of Action adopted [see Al36/333]. That effort reinforces our solidarity and we establish among ourselves the necessary principles of cooperation, self-confidence, equity and mutual benefit.\n74.\tThe Group of 77 considers the Program and its implementation as an effort at the collective restructuring of international economic relations, the establishment of a new international economic order, and a way for developing nations to become aware of and apply their potential, exercising the prominent position which is theirs by right and showing that, through will and vision, the obstacles which stand in the way of a better future for all may be overcome.\n75.\tThe areas selected are strategic in the evolution of our societies and through them we seek a balanced approach to handling our complementary attributes.\n76.\tI am honored to present this Program to the international community; it does not seek to replace the responsibilities of the developed countries. Its implementation will help to construct an international community ruled by the will to live in cooperation through self-managed human and material resources.\n77.\tWe aim at the operative levels, recognizing the global nature of the crisis and its solutions and seeking a negotiating process which will commit the political wills of the participating nations. We know what is at stake and must make the necessary decisions. It is not a matter of lapsing into transitory phases, nor of remaining therein. We must have clear objectives and program and carry out the required action until we achieve fair, sound and beneficial world relations.\n78.\tThe challenge assumes gigantic dimensions. If our efforts fail out of stubbornness or impermanence in decision-making, we shall have exhausted the roads to negotiation and consultation and placed the United Nations system in a powerless vacuum.\n79.\tWe have waited as long as necessary to adopt decisions and to present them to this forum, the appropriate one in which all can participate equally in a debate on matters of general and fundamental interest.\n80.\tVenezuela is honored to have been invited to speak at the highest level with countries of great political and economic importance, on the subject of international cooperation in its widest sense. We trust that at the forthcoming meeting in Cancun, Mexico, the will to find solutions will prevail and be rapidly reflected in the global negotiations which the international community must undertake to regulate its economic relations. The presence in this Assembly of the representatives of participants at that meeting leads me to ask, on my own behalf and with permission of the Assembly on behalf of all developing countries, that the dialog live up to the objectives of the global negotiations process which we propose.\n81.\tWe must overcome the reticence confronting the North-South dialog, reactivate it and impart to it a substantial and operative content with clear objectives. Thus, within a period of months, we shall have launched a complete revision of international economic relations in the North-South and South-South channels, recovering faith in our own collective future.\n82.\tDuring this season Venezuela will end its chairmanship of the Group of 77. We cannot judge our own actions, but we made the greatest possible effort to be loyal to and worthy of the trust placed in us. We had made the same effort long before assuming chairmanship of the Group and we shall continue to do so in the future: our international actions are consistent with the democratic principles on which they are based and are not confined to the temporary presidency, with which we were honored, of the Group of 77.\n83.\tAn African nation will soon replace Venezuela at the head of this Group. That encourages us to reflect on the understanding among Africa, Asia and Latin America in the context of the current world situation. The peoples of those three continents, with their similarities and differences, have a permanent vocation for justice, liberty and peace. \nI 84. Venezuela believes that the challenge of the future 1 lies in the cultural, scientific and technological development of the third world countries, allowing them to evolve on autonomous bases. In 1980 we created the Foundation for the International Institute of Advanced Studies, among whose major and most representative pro-grammes insofar as Venezuela's co-operative effort is concerned is the creation of the \\\"Institute of Higher Studies of Third-World Science and Technology\\\", or \\\"Intermundo\\\" which will be solidly backed by the member countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC], for the purpose of providing centers where people may meet and for the dissemination of scientific progress through graduate courses offered to young technicians and professionals in the developing world.\n85.\tConcern for the Caribbean Basin's economic and social development led the Governments of Canada, Mexico, the United States and my own Government to meet in Nassau last July.\n86.\tThe participating Governments issued a joint communique in which they restated their determination to continue efforts on behalf of the continuing, integral development of the area, with plans and priorities laid down by the countries of the area, free of military considerations or prior political conditions.\n\n87.\tMy country shares many problems and needs with the nations of that Basin and supports them as far as its means and level of development allow.\n88.\tThis cooperation effort is a move towards the new international economic order rather than the establishment of any particular relations in detriment of the North-South dialog. Conscious of the size of this undertaking, we should like other Governments within or outside the region to help those countries to achieve their national development. I extend this invitation to the Assembly.\n89.\tNo new international economic order can exist so long as colonialism endures. Since the creation of the United Nations my country has remained firmly anti-colonial in its policy, regardless of the centers of power in question.\n90.\tConfronted by colonialism, this Organization has complied with and will continue to further the struggle for the independence of peoples subjected to foreign domination and should be particularly energetic not only in the face of conventional colonialism, but also of new and subtle types of pressure of one State over another new forms of covert colonialism.\n91.\tVenezuela has been especially interested in the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and hopes that that Conference, one of the most important held under the Organization's auspices, can fulfill next year the mandate which it received from the General Assembly in 1970. The Venezuelan people are very pleased that the Conference began its work in Caracas.\n92.\tIn Latin America and the Caribbean, we also suffer from problems of colonialism or its vestiges, or other\ntypes of foreign domination.\n93.\tOn our continent, particularly in the Caribbean area, new States have entered the international community as full sovereign nations. Venezuela, because of its geographical ties and as a friend and good neighbor, feels committed to the efforts of those nations as they become ever increasingly the masters of their own destiny. However, there are still cases to be solved and we trust that solutions will continue to be found, without the traumas that have occurred in other parts of the world.\n94.\tI hope that the day is not far off when the Latin American people of Puerto Rico take their place among us. We nurture this hope of all Latin Americans, in the conviction that it is for the people of Puerto Rico alone to determine their future.\n95.\tThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries is one of the major organized expressions of the third world. Venezuela, as an observer of the Movement, shares the basic principles and objectives which inspire it.\n96.\tWe live in very difficult times. Tensions increase, and we return to a cold war which seems to spread and deepen. Extremists use terrorism as a weapon to subjugate the will of the people. Human rights are violated day after day, not only by Government regimes, but by organizations which share the common denominator of practicing violence.\n97.\tIn Africa, racism and the intervention of diverse poles of power fuel the flames of violence. Apartheid provokes indignation in the spirits of free men, and the United Nations has always condemned and stigmatized this practice.\n98.\tThe Middle East continues to be an explosive region. No serious effort is made to terminate the conflict between Iraq and Iran. Lebanon continues to be martyred, and peace cannot be achieved nor kept until there is a global solution to the conflict accepted by all the parties involved and until the legitimate rights of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples to live in peace and freedom are recognized.\n99.\tIn Europe and North America, the neutron bomb is announced and the world recoils in justified horror. Never has man felt so afraid of himself of his destructive creation, to state it paradoxically.\n100.\tIn Asia, foreign occupation threatens the peace, sovereignty and independence of the countries of the region. Afghanistan is pain writ in red letters.\n101.\tIn Europe, the noise of tanks and boots reverberates and the silhouettes of missiles point in every direction. While Solidarity shakes the popular soul of Poland, the shadow of powerful maneuvers huddles like a threat over that often-invaded country, whose people remain intact as such, in spite of successive dismemberments.\n102.\tSometimes it seems that the United States and the Soviet Union feel themselves to be the owners of a world at whose creation they were absent, but whose hour of destruction they feel capable of imposing in an act of anti-gods. \n103.\tLatin America and the Caribbean, like other continents, cannot cease to serve as a stage for confrontations among the global-domination strategies,\n104.\tOn this occasion the sister Republic of El Salvador, a small Central American country and the long-time victim of typical military dictatorships serving the interests of predatory, selfish and insensitive oligarchies, was chosen. Dictatorship was overthrown by a civilian and military alliance which stated democratic convictions and received the support of the Salvadorian people. Deep political, social and economic reforms were immediately undertaken, transforming the agrarian, financial and commercial structure and attempting to open roads for the people, through free elections, to decide their own destiny, without foreign interference.\n105.\tThe reaction could not be crueler or more fearful. The extreme right, rightly deprived of its ancestral privileges, has unleashed a perverse series of terrorist actions, violating human rights in an attempt to recover its lost power and to impose a new dictatorship in its own interest.\n106.\tThe extreme left, relying on the material backing of foreign countries, has also resorted to violence to attempt at any price to retain the abolition of social and economic injustice and to prevent the holding of free elections from ending its opportunity.\n107.\tThe \\\"ultras\\\" attempt to erase any possibility of a political, democratic and civil center. Neither side will allow itself to be counted, so as not to reveal its smallness.\n108.\tUnfortunately, some democratic countries have recently committed the error of attempting to impart an undeserved respectability to groups devoted to terrorism and to play the game of those who see a moral equality be-tween the side that is making efforts to offer a political opening through elections leading to legal institutions, and the side that is undertaking efforts to prevent such a process. Believing that they are facilitating peace, they may institutionalize war on Central American soil. El Salvador could relive the tragedy of Spain.\n109.\tMy Government has offered support to the Government of President Napoleon Duarte on the basis of its solemn promise to allow the Salvadorian people to elect their Government. This is done in support of freedom and peace, and not of any given tendency or group, as we do not wish to influence the internal affairs of that sister nation.\n110.\tVenezuelans believe in and practice democracy. We do not attempt to impose our own values and concepts of society on anyone, but we know that freedom is the road of history.\n111.\tWe believe in pluralism, within and without. We believe in solidarity and international cooperation. We contributed to the foundation of OPEC and helped to make it a formidable instrument to guarantee a fair price for a rare, strategic and expensive energy resource. This was a first step, which pointed the way for weak and developing countries. The road is open; traffic is invited.\n112.\tThe effect of the price of non-renewable energy sources on the international economic situation is frequently cited, overlooking the contribution which those same resources, very differently valued, have made to the material and social progress of advanced industrial societies. We need not recall that OPEC is a necessary de-fence mechanism in the face of the increasing prices of manufactured goods which we import.\n113.\tThe wealth enjoyed and largely wasted by the industrialized countries today is tied to the systematic undervaluation of these resources, dating back many decades. We received an unfair price and were almost expected to be grateful for it, as though it were a generous gesture.\n114.\tOil is an example typical of the many adverse effects of international economic relations based on the undervaluation of the developing world's resources and on poorly conceived and badly managed independence, as well as on the possible internal and international effects of the indefinite postponement of decisions related to the future evolution of those relations.\n115.\tThe situation is only partially resolved when new global responsibilities are imposed in the monetary or financial order. We must recall that constantly devalued foreign exchange is of little real value, as are investment portfolios subject to the goodwill of nations receiving our investments in public debentures, if it is not recognized that our financial surplus, eminently circumstantial over the long term, also helps to maintain the levels of investment, production and employment through the placement of capital in productive sectors through credit and the importation of goods and services.\n116.\tCurrent technological challenges continue to be motivated and justified in terms of costs, because of the revaluation of hydrocarbons. The time has not yet come when the contribution to the progress of humanity of a group of oil exporting countries can be objectively evaluated, although many developing countries consider the experience as traumatic.\n117.\tRecent events have proved us to be right. We have maintained that oil prices are not responsible for inflation and the West's economic crisis. For some time the in-crease in oil prices has been checked; the price has even dropped in some instances. But the inflationary process has not stopped, for the simple reason that it is the result of the economic policies of the various governments.\n118.\tVenezuela, as a developing country, has been willing to respond to calls for international solidarity. Our principles are devoid of selfishness, and our objectives of progress are not and never will be based on the exploitation of the needs of others.\n119.\tAt the regional level we took the initiative of inviting Mexico to participate in an Energy cooperation Pro-gramme for Central American and Caribbean Countries, not only guaranteeing these nations a supply of oil and favorable terms of payment, but permitting 30 per cent of the oil bill to be converted into long-term (20-year) loans at minimum interest (2 per cent) if used for development plans, particularly the search for new sources of energy. At the bilateral level, we have major cooperation programs with countries of diverse socio-political orientations, such as Nicaragua, Grenada, El Salvador, Dominica and Jamaica. We are also prepared to consider possibilities of cooperation with our brothers in Africa and Asia, within our modest limitations. We do this in the conviction that unconditional cooperation and the greatest respect for the international processes of Governments are tension-releasing and peace-generating factors.\n120.\tThe evolution of the developing countries' economies depends both on their own efforts and on the existence of favorable external conditions. They face today a series of outside pressures, as indicated by the financial problems pressing upon them.\n121.\tThe growing imbalance in developing countries' transactions apart from the oil countries with respect to the rest of the world during the seventies, has increased dramatically in the last two years. According to International Monetary Fund calculations, the current account deficit in 1980 rose to $82 billion, as against $38 billion in 1978. Estimates for the current year indicate that the deficit will approach $100 billion.\n122.\tThe major factors involved in this recent deterioration were the erosion of the purchasing power of exports and the foreign exchange drain caused by the cost of foreign debt. The recession in the industrialized countries and the emergence of protectionist pressures resulted in lower growth in exports and weakened prices for raw materials. This was complicated by losses caused by international inflation and the adjustment of oil prices. Debt servicing further reduced the availability of foreign exchange to finance the foreign cost of the development process.\n123.\tLimitations imposed on growth by world imbalances were attenuated by resorting to foreign indebtedness. During the last 10 years, the pending obligations of developing countries have multiplied more than sixfold: in 1980 they amounted to $370 billion.\n124.\tIn 1973, private financing accounted for more than 50 per cent of those countries' total liabilities, rising to 58 per cent by 1980. This dependency might have possibly been even greater without the active participation of OPEC in international financial cooperation. In contrast, the unfavorable attitude of the industrialized nations with respect to international aid helped create an even greater need for developing countries to seek assistance in private markets.\n125.\tThe volatility of exchange rates and deficiencies in the adjustment, creation and distribution of international liquidity caused by the lack of a real international mone-tary system constitute a set of problems in addition to those attributable to prevailing economic conditions and to structural deficiencies in the world economy, in which the third world as reflected in the Brandt Report3\u2014does not participate effectively in controlling its own development financing.\n126.\tThe major problems of social injustice, unemployment, inflation, production, access of the developing world's manufactured goods to the industrialized nations' markets, the urgent need for women to participate in social life, the increasing organized power of workers and farmers, the need for development models* educational reform, cultural animation and the advance of science and technology\u2014all are problems of capital importance which call for comment.\n127.\tHowever, I shall address myself briefly to the problem of hunger, the greatest threat now facing mankind.\n128.\tOn 24 June 1981, a select group of 50 men of science and the arts, winners of the Nobel Peace Prize and of the Nobel Prizes in literature, physics, chemistry, economics and medicine, made a dramatic call. to return to life tens of millions of human beings, dying of hunger and underdevelopment, victims of the political and international economic disorder currently prevailing\\\", and concluded, optimistically, that \\\"it is necessary, without delay, to choose, work, create and live in order to create life\\\".\n129.\tFAO, in making 16 October World Food Day, has attempted to emphasize the fact that man must become aware of the need for food security, intimately tied to agrarian social reform, the agricultural, productive and technological process, to the fair distribution of surpluses, to poverty, which is the main cause of hunger, and to international solidarity.\n130.\tWe must turn again to the land, to agricultural growth within the positive social framework of integrated rural development, in a joint and sustained effort. Today, two thirds of the world's food comes from the United States, which supplies 50 per cent of the wheat, 50 per cent of the corn and 80 per cent of the soybeans required by the rest of mankind. As for cereals, three quarters of the world's population depend on the United States for their supplies.\n131.\tThe United States dominates \\\"food power\\\". The former French Minister of Agriculture, Mr. E. Pisani, has stated:\n\\\"There are five ways of ruling the world: through arms, science, energy, minerals and food. In the first four sectors, the United States is neck and neck with other Powers, but it dominates the world market in staple foods (cereals, sugar and oilseeds). This domination will grow, and the world imbalance will worsen\\\".\nThat fact increases the social and human responsibility of the United States in a world threatened by hunger.\n132.\tThe developing countries have been asked on several occasions to set as their objective an average yearly increase of 4 per cent in food and agricultural production. This goal has not yet been reached. In the 1970s the effective increase was 3 per cent. These efforts must be constant and persistent, since imported food is very expensive. For example, between 19671969 and 19761978 the volume of cereal imported by the weaker developing countries increased by only 14 per cent, but the prices nearly doubled, and the shipping costs increased fourfold.\n133.\tFinally, it is worth pointing out that by the year 2000 foreign assistance for agriculture, according to the experts, should reach $10 billion. In contrast, the program for the continuance of world military expenses currently amount!; to $450 billion per year.\n134.\tI should like to state the five principles which guide the policy of Venezuela in the United Nations as a Latin American country.\n135.\tFirst, the problems of Latin America should be solved by Latin Americans, without foreign interference, and without direct or indirect hemispheric or extra-hemispheric intervention.\n\n136.\tSecond, Latin America's position vis-\u00e0-vis the world's great and serious problems should be autonomous, and neither related to nor integrated with the interests of bloc politics.\n137.\tThird, Latin America should seek agreements with Africa and Asia in the framework of South-South cooperation.\n138.\tFourth, Latin America should seek increasing agreements with Africa and Asia, both in adopting a common approach to problems in North-South relations and in assuming positions with respect to the many aspects of the East-West confrontation.\n139.\tFifth, Latin America should seek with Africa and Asia the structural reform of international institutions to ensure democratic control of the international community.\n140.\tThe peoples of the third world have growing bar-gaining power and should use it to the maximum to bring about a new international order.\n141.\tVenezuela and the countries of Latin America and the third world need a secure policy to strengthen our political independence, economic stability, cultural identity and defense against possible aggression.\n142.\tThe present international order is the product of self-seeking nations which have grown old and worn themselves out exploiting us and of new Powers which only attempt to replace them in their negative role.\n143.\tWe are the vigorous expression of the world's youth, the powerful presence of the new age. This new age is growing up in the furrows of history, beautiful in its challenge, and, with God's help and the backing of our peoples, we will respond in greatness.\n144.\tAt the founding of this Organization we proclaimed the need to promote and encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. We proclaimed those fervent and hopeful principles so that there should be no repetition of persecution and torture and the annihilation of human groups, or of disregard for the most elementary guarantees of dignified coexistence.\n145.\tYet political persecution, racial discrimination, religious intolerance, open or concealed genocide, and the drug traffic continue and increase, with no effective possibility of terminating these abuses and prosecuting those responsible. We have not been able to uproot terror and plant firm hope.\n146.\tThis is an Organization of \\\"peace-loving countries\\\". In that spirit it was created, and in that spirit it should continue. That is the spirit that imbues Venezuela's foreign policy in all situations.\n147.\tThose countries which continually intervene in the internal and external affairs of others and inflict blood- baths on resisting peoples are not lovers of peace.\n148.\tThose countries which openly trample on fundamental human rights and torture, kill or cause to disappear their presumed or real enemies are not lovers of peace.\n149.\tThose countries which have built an unfair world which they have held for their own benefit for generations, and which refuse to make the smallest changes to alleviate manifest injustice, are not lovers of peace.\n150.\tAs President of a peaceful and united people, I again express my wishes for peace, a true peace, a peace without pitfalls.\n151.\tThe gap between the more developed and less developed countries cannot be maintained indefinitely.\n152.\tIt cannot be assumed that the dispossessed will for long accept with resignation their gradual and irreversible impoverishment.\n153.\tThe United Nations is the proper forum for the correction of existing wrongs through negotiation. I wished to -be present at this thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly to restate Venezuela's faith in this Organization, and in peace and the hope of achieving peace.\n154.\tWe, the developing countries, constitute a majority in the United Nations, and our solidarity is our most formidable power resource. We hereby give notice that the powerful cannot be endlessly insatiable, nor can the poor and exploited be endlessly patient.\n155.\tWe all need peace to live in justice and liberty, and thus to make of love the highest and most solid spiritual and creative link among men and peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like at the outset, on behalf of the delegation of Zaire and on my own behalf, to offer Mr. Kittani my heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of his election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. This sign of confidence is a tribute to his competence, to his sense of responsibility, to his perfect knowledge of the workings of the United Nations and to his country. His devotion to the ideals of the United Nations and his vast experience of international problems are in our view of singular value for the success of our deliberations.\n244.\tWe wish to assure him of the full cooperation of the delegation of Zaire in the discharge of the very delicate and complex mission with which he has been entrusted.\n245.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, for the skill and patience with which he conducted the debates of the Assembly at its thirty-fifth session and for the efforts he made to narrow diverging positions on the world problems of the moment, and particularly on global negotiations.\n246.\tI cannot fail to mention the action undertaken by the SecretaryGeneral, for the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of the ideals of the United Nations in a decidedly difficult international situation in which the very principles of tK Organization have sometimes been seriously challenged.\n247.\tI wish to express to him our appreciation of the clarity of his report [AI36I1] and the lucidity of his analysis of the international situation. Undoubtedly this has been a valuable contribution to the enrichment of our deliberations.\n248.\tSince its creation in 1945 the Organization has been constantly enriched by the free accession of new Member States, testifying to its dynamism and the justice of its ideals. The admission of Vanuatu and Belize as the one hundred fifty-fifth and one hundred fifty-sixth Members is striking proof of this. My delegation welcomes the admission of those two new Members and, in welcoming them to the United Nations, assures them of our friendship and cooperation.\n249.\tThis session of the General Assembly has opened in a tense international climate, characterized by distrust, pessimism and anxiety. Indeed, mankind is at the present time going through one of the most critical periods in its history.\n250.\tIn the political sphere, the spirit of confrontation, violence, the use of force and interference in the internal affairs of other States tend to put their stamp on international relations, to the detriment of the principles of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation based on the philosophy of complementarity and interdependence.\n251.\tThe resurgence of the cold war, the hegemonistic ambitions and expansion of the great Powers, the pursuit of spheres of influence and the escalation of the unbridled arms race have given the latter part of this century an aftertaste of blood and ashes.\n252.\tIn the economic sphere, the persistent refusal of the developed countries to embark upon the structural and institutional changes necessary for the restructuring and democratization of international economic relations, the acute deterioration of the terms of trade, inflation, unemployment, protectionism, and so on, have helped to bring about a dramatic worsening of the crisis. We can never repeat sufficiently that the present international economic order, based on exploitation and injustice, is fundamentally inadequate and unsuitable. This crisis is not a mere cyclical phenomenon but rather the manifestation of a profound disruption of the structures of the present international economic system, which is no longer able effectively to respond to the needs either of the developing countries or of the industrialized developed countries themselves.\n253.\tIn this period of interdependence, the exploitation, domination and poverty of peoples in one part of the world cannot for long coexist with peace, brazen affluence and prosperity in other parts of the world, especially if there is a deep-seated feeling that the resources of the poor have been exploited to create the prosperity of the rich.\n254.\tWe believe, therefore, that it is time to undertake large-scale international action under United Nations auspices to find a comprehensive solution to the problems affecting our planet, unless we wish to confront a more serious world crisis with unforeseeable consequences.\n255.\tThere has been no positive progress on the many problems of major concern which were debated at the thirty-fifth session. On the contrary, many of them have worsened.\n256.\tThe question of the Middle East and Palestine has been of concern to the United Nations since the Organization's creation. In spite of many General Assembly sessions, meetings of the Security Council and relevant United Nations resolutions, the chances of a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the conflict have been compromised by the denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the persistence of Israel's policies of aggression, occupation and annexation of Arab territories.\n257.\tThere is no shadow of doubt that Israel derives its arrogance from the political, economic and military support that it receives from certain great Powers. My delegation believes that the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region necessarily involves: the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied in 1967; the right to existence of each State in the region, as well as its right to live in peace within secure, recognized borders, free from threats or acts of force; respect for and recognition of the Sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of each State in the region; respect for and recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to create their own State and the right to self-determination, independence and national sovereignty; recognition of the fact that the Palestinian question is at the heart of the Middle East conflict; the full participation of the PLO in the peace process in the region; the right of the Palestinians to return to their homes; and a just solution to the refugee problem.\n258.\tAll of that implies direct negotiations between the parties involved and the cessation of any state of war in the region. It is in that spirit that we have supported Egypt's peace efforts, which we regard as an important step in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict. In the same spirit we consider, without prejudice to the other relevant resolutions, that Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which defined the guiding principles for a comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict, complements General Assembly resolution 181 (II), of 29 November 1947, on the creation of a Jewish State of Palestine and an Arab State of Palestine, and resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948.\n259.\tThe Republic of Zaire reaffirms its complete support for the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force.\n260.\tThe persistence of the Middle East crisis has caused new dangers and threats to the peace, independence and integrity of other States in the region. Lebanon, which has already been sapped by a fratricidal war between Christians and Moslems, has for some time lived with the spectre of its own destruction. The international community cannot view with indifference the dismemberment of a Member State That is why my delegation considers that all Member States have the duty to strive to safeguard the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon, which have been seriously imperiled.\n261.\tThe violation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the Israeli act of aggression against the Iraqi nuclear installation at Tamuz, which is regularly monitored by IAEA, marked a new stage in the escalation of violence and in the worsening of tension in the region. Zaire vigorously condemns that act of aggression, for which Israel was entirely responsible.\n262.\tIn the same region, for almost a year another war has pitted against each other two Moslem countries that are members of the nonaligned movement Iraq and Iran. The Zaire delegation expresses the wish that there would soon be a peaceful settlement of this conflict. In this regard, it welcomes the efforts by the SecretaryGeneral and by other organizations to bring about the restoration of peace and understanding between these two brother States.\n263.\tThe situation in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea continues to preoccupy international opinion. The Republic of Zaire is duty-bound to recall that the search for lasting solutions to those conflicts must include respect for General Assembly resolutions 34/22, 35/6 and 35/37, which reaffirmed the following principles: nonintervention and noninterference in the internal affairs of States; non-recourse to the use of force in international relations; the peaceful settlement of disputes; respect for the territorial integrity, political independence and sovereignty of\nStates; and the right of peoples to self-determination. Those are the conditions for a peaceful solution.\n264.\tAccordingly, we consider that the prior withdrawal of foreign troops will create the conditions which would  favor a comprehensive political settlement and enable the peoples concerned freely to decide their own future and their own destiny, free from any external interference, subversion or coercion.\n265.\tIn the Korean peninsula there has been permanent tension for 36 years, following the division of that country by the victors in the Second World War. My delegation thinks that it is primarily for the Korean people themselves to resolve this problem by a direct dialog between the North and the South, free from any outside pressure. However, in the interests of peace and detente the United Nations should take new action to create conditions  favorable to a resumption of negotiations between the two parties. Indeed, we remain convinced that such negotiations are the only practical way to achieve a peaceful solution to all the problems resulting from the division of the country and to promote a relaxation of tension in that part of the world. In accordance with our policies, Zaire has recognized the two Koreas and maintains with both excellent relations of friendship and cooperation.\n266.\tAs regards Cyprus, resumption of the inter-communal talks seems to us to be a basic condition for bringing about a just and equitable solution to the crisis in that country. The United Nations, through the SecretaryGeneral, should continue its efforts to help the two communities find a basis of understanding and to create the conditions for a return to peace.\n267.\tSince .1945 the colonial Powers, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, have pledged themselves to guarantee the political advancement of the peoples in the colonial territories and to develop their ability to govern themselves. Since its creation the United Nations has ceaselessly worked for respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and independence, taking account of their own aspirations and the overriding importance of their own interests.\n268.\tGeneral Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), of 14 December 1960, which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, solemnly proclaimed the need to put a speedy end to colonialism and all practices of segregation and discrimination throughout the world.\n269.\tMore than 20 years later, we are happy to note it at a number of colonial territories have acceded to independence and now swell the ranks of the United Nations, thus helping it to fulfill its universal vocation. This is an undoubted success, to the credit of the Organization. Unfortunately, there are still some blots on this picture, particularly in southern Africa, where a handful of white racists continue, despite international condemnation, to practice an abject policy which has been universally condemned as a crime against humanity, to deprive the black majority of the South African population of their most elementary rights, illegally to occupy Namibia and to deny the inhabitants of that Territory their right to self determination, freedom and independence.\n270.\tSouth Africa's refusal to leave Namibia and its delaying tactics, designed to hold up that country's accession to independence notwithstanding the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, are an unacceptable challenge that must be met by the international community as a whole. That anachronistic regime is encouraged in its obstinacy and arrogance by the economic and military cooperation it continues to enjoy from certain States Members of the United Nations.\n271.\tThe Republic of Zaire considers that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only basis on which the Namibian question can be settled. It reaffirms the primary responsibility of the United Nations from that Territory since the termination of South Africa's Mandate in 1966.\n272.\tThe continued occupation of Namibia, the illegal nature of which has been recognized and reaffirmed by the Security Council, coupled with the denial of the fundamental rights of the Namibian people and the repeated acts of aggression by /South Africa against neighboring States from occupied Namibia, constitute a grave threat to international peace and security. This amply justifies recourse to comprehensive and effective mandatory measures to restore peace and stability to that region.\n273.\tThe Republic ox Zaire, whose geography and history link it with southern Africa, attaches great importance to the establishment and maintenance of a climate of peace and stability in southern Africa through the speedy accession to independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\n274.\tFollowing the failure of the Geneva pre-implementation meeting on the United Nations plan for Namibia, the Security Council should draw the appropriate conclusions from the recent International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, held in Paris, and take all the necessary measures advocated by the General Assembly at its eighth emergency special session [resolution ES8/2] on Namibia, including those prescribed in Chapter VII of the Charter, if South Africa continues to flout the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. In no circumstances could the Republic of Zaire sanction any approach that would tend to  favor South Africa in the quest for a negotiated solution of the Namibian question.\n275.\tIn this respect, Zaire reiterates its total support for the legitimate struggle being waged by SWAPO for the self-determination and independence of the Namibian people and vehemently condemns South Africa's repeated acts of aggression against neighboring States, in particular that recently perpetrated against its sister Republic of Angola.\n276.\tZaire appeals to all States Members of the United Nations to give concrete expression to their solidarity with the victims of South Africa's barbaric acts. We urge those countries which continue to support South Africa to observe the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and to cease all forms of collaboration with the illegal minority regime of Pretoria.\n277.\tThe delegation of the Republic of Zaire reaffirms its support for the oppressed people of South Africa, as well as for the national liberation movements and the heroic and just struggle they are waging to recover their wounded dignity and legitimate rights.\n278.\tRegarding the problem of Western Sahara, Zaire is happy to note that once again African wisdom and the virtues of dialog have prevailed over the spirit of confrontation. Here we must pay a well-deserved tribute to His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco for the political courage he demonstrated at the recent Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, which paved the way for progress towards a peaceful settlement of the dispute.\n279.\tWe urge the international community to support the process of peaceful settlement which has begun and to refrain from any initiative that might jeopardize the effort that has been undertaken by the OAU.\n280.\tOne of the important issues of concern to the world in general and to the African continent in particular is undoubtedly the problem of refugees. Of the 10 million refugees who have been counted throughout the world, 5 million live in Africa, including almost 1 million in Zaire. Apart from the moral and physical suffering they endure, the housing, placement and reclassification of those refugees place a heavy burden on the meager, resources of our young States, which themselves are confronted by problems of development.\n281.\tThe delegation of Zaire welcomes the efforts that have been undertaken within the United Nations system, particularly by UNHCR, to find a comprehensive solution to this problem. The International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa, held last April at Geneva under United Nations auspices, enabled the international community to appreciate the gravity of this phenomenon and to decide on certain specific measures to assist African refugees.\n282.\tThe Republic of Zaire welcomes the spirit of solidarity shown by some countries at that Conference and hopes that the international community will intensify its efforts to alleviate the plight of African refugees. We must show imagination in our search for comprehensive solutions to this problem.\n283.\tThe deterioration of the climate of confidence in international relations and the search for a hypothetical balance of forces, which underlies all theories of deterrence, maintain the infernal cycle of the arms race. If mankind is threatened with self-destruction it is certainly through a nuclear holocaust. Mankind has for some time been living under a permanent threat of annihilation because of the proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction which neither United Nations resolutions nor fine-sounding declarations of intent by those who possess those weapons have been able to check.\n284.\tNotwithstanding the proclamation of the first Disarmament Decade [resolution 2602IE (XXIV)] and the Plan of Action adopted by the Geneva Assembly at its tenth special session [see resolution ES10/2], which was devoted to disarmament, little progress has been made because of the lack of political will on the part of the great Powers. We feel that while disarmament is the concern of all States, the responsibility for halting and reversing the arms race rests first and foremost with the great Powers.\n285.\tThe nuclear-weapon States must also undertake by means of an international convention to guarantee the nonnuclear-weapon States, in particular those which have undertaken by treaty not to acquire nuclear weapons, against the use or threat of use of such weapons.\n286.\tThe proclamation by the United Nations of nuclear-free zones has been an important contribution to the establishment of a climate of peace and security in the world/Unfortunately, in the African region the possession of the' nuclear weapon by South Africa thanks to the collaboration of certain States Members of the United Nations makes the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa void of meaning, because once South Africa, a State which is overtly hostile to a number of neighboring African States, has the nuclear weapon there is no reason to prevent other African States from having access to it for the purpose of self-defense.\n287.\tThe possession of that weapon by a State which has no sense of respect for the customary rules of international conduct and international conventions and which continually ignores the resolutions adopted by the Organization constitutes indeed a grave threat to peace and security in Africa.\n288.\tThus the question of confidence-building measures in international relations becomes extremely important. General and complete disarmament under international control remains the basic condition for the establishment of an overall climate of trust and reduction of the risks of tension throughout the world.\n289.\tThe Republic of Zaire has always approached the question of disarmament from the point of view of peace, security, confidence-building measures and development. Indeed, it has been acknowledged that the arms race swallows up enormous resources that could more usefully have been devoted to organizing progress and improving the living conditions of millions of human beings throughout the world.\n290.\tAs everyone knows, the world economy has recently been going through a particularly serious period of crisis unprecedented since the end of the Second World War. This crisis affects all countries without distinction, whatever their levels of economic development. The deterioration of the terms of trade continues; industrial activity is practically stagnating; expansion of world trade has slowed down; payments imbalances have been accentuated; unemployment and underemployment continue to worsen, and the high rates of inflation have not fallen.\n291.\tThe developing countries which do not export oil in particular those of the African continent, economically the least developed of all continents, the most dependent on the economies of the industrialized countries and consequently the most vulnerable have not achieved significant growth rates.\n292.\tThe developed countries continue to be the masters of world trade and manipulate at will the prices of raw materials, keeping them at an abnormally low level to the detriment of the commodity-exporting countries. The gap between the purchasing power of the export earnings of those countries and the cost of the goods imported from developed countries grows ever wider, and everything indicates that these negative tendencies wiil become even more accentuated.\n293.\tThis situation, which is of great concern for one side and of desperation for the other, calls for the thorough and urgent restructuring of present international economic relations. Hence the need for the immediate resumption of global negotiations to implement effectively measures relating to the establishment of a new international economic order which is more just and equitable, in a manner that is consistent and integrated in accordance with the spirit and letter of General Assembly resolution 34/138.\n294.\tThe International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [resolution 35/56] emphasizes the urgency of measures which would speedily eliminate all obstacles to the economic liberation of developing countries and help launch a series of global negotiations for the 1980s.\n295.\tThe delegation of Zaire deplores the lack of progress in launching the global negotiations and the failure of the work of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly, which it ascribes to the absence of political will by the industrialized countries, which have not honored the commitments they undertook in respect of international cooperation and the establishment of the new international economic order. It is highly regrettable that Governments which a few years ago undertook to promote the cause of development have not met the hopes placed in them. It is to be hoped that the major industrialized countries, in accordance with the communique issued at the end of the summit meeting held at Ottawa, 7 will in the future be ready to participate in the preparation of a mutually acceptable process for global negotiations in conditions in which significant progress can be made, following the meeting to be held at Cancun.\n296.\tThe Republic of Zaire has opted for frank cooperation with mutual advantage to North and South and attaches great importance to overcoming the obstacles blocking the NorthSouth dialog and to the launching of global negotiations to bring about a new spirit in international economic relations.\n297.\tIn the sphere of international trade, while there is reason to welcome the progress made within UNCTAD, particularly as far as the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities and the agreements on cocoa, tin and natural rubber are concerned, it is yet true that as regards the complete implementation of resolution 93 (IV) on the Integrated program for Commodities adopted by UNCTAD at Nairobi a resolution which was supported by all Member States and negotiations on the adoption of a code of conduct for the transfer of technology, there is still a lack of political will on the part of the developed countries. Much still remains to be done.\n298.\tIn order to increase the value of commodities, stabilize prices and guarantee a remunerative and stable income to the producers, but especially to enable UNCTAD to accomplish its primary mission and really help the efforts of the developing countries, we urge the developed countries to relinquish their egoism and prevarication and adhere resolutely to the principle of international solidarity.\n299.\tThe Republic of Zaire appeals to the international community to give practical effect to the will it has so often expressed so that agreements on other primary products listed in the Nairobi Integrated program, in particular copper, manganese and vegetable oils, may positively and speedily mark the second stage in the negotiations.\n300.\tIf there is an area in which the Republic of Zaire needs special assistance from the international community, as has been recognized by the Economic and Social Council, UNCTAD and the General Assembly, it is that of transport infrastructure.\n301.\tGeneral Assembly resolutions 34/193 and 35/59 and resolution 1981/68, adopted at the second regular session for 1981 of the Economic and Social Council, relating to the specific problems of Zaire in the field of transport, transit and access to international markets require particularly urgent attention. The delegation of Zaire hopes that the report of the SecretaryGeneral on the implementation of those resolutions will help to speed up the quest for a solution to this problem.\n302.\tCooperation between developing countries is a requirement for the installation of the new international economic order. That is why all States Members of the United Nations and agencies within the United Nations system should support the program of Action adopted by the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held at Caracas [see A/361333 and Corr.1], to promote the collective efforts of the developing countries, because strengthening this economic cooperation will help speed up the economic growth of these countries and help lessen their dependence and their vulnerability with regard to the outside world.\n303.\tAccordingly, the Lagos Plan of Action 10 which is part of the collective and individual program for self reliance of the Group of 77, deserves the support of the international community so that it can be immediately implemented. J. should like to launch a solemn appeal to all States Members of the United Nations to give continuing support to the OAU in implementing this Plan.\n304.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which has just concluded its work in Paris, examined in depth the particular problems of the least developed countries, to which my country gives full support. We hope that the encouraging promises and the commitment undertaken by certain developed countries during this important Conference will be honored.\n305.\tMan has a duty to conserve and preserve nature, to maintain the balance of ecosystems, a balance necessary to his own survival. It is in this spirit that the General Assembly adopted resolution 35/7 on the draft World Charter for Nature, and invited Member States to conduct their activities with regard for the supreme importance of the protection of natural systems, the maintenance of the balance and the quality of nature in the interests of present and future generations.\n306.\tThe Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity at its thirty-seventh session unanimously adopted and the Assembly of Heads of State and Government endorsed, resolution CM/Res. 852 (XXXVII) [see A/36/534, annex /], which recommends the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the draft World Charter for Nature. We would hope that the recommendations contained in the report of the SecretaryGeneral, worked out on the basis of observations made by Member States, will make it possible to adopt th.is Charter as soon as possible.\n307.\tThis review of the major political and economic problems besetting our world would be incomplete without a reference to the important question of the law of the sea, negotiations on which seem to have stalled.\n308.\tSome questions on the work program of the tenth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which we had hoped would win a general consensus at the resumed Geneva session, have not yet been resolved.\n309.\tFor the developing countries which like us are land-based producers, it is vital that questions relating to production policies for, and to control of the exploitation of, the seabed and ocean floor should find a satisfactory solution.\n310.\tIt is appropriate here to emphasize that the seabed and the ocean floor are the common heritage of mankind and that their exploitation must take particular account of the interests of the developing countries.\n311.\tEveryone knows that the seabed and ocean floor contain innumerable mineral resources in the form of polymetallic nodules containing cobalt, copper, nickel, manganese, so forth, and that unplanned production would obviously be highly prejudicial to the interests of the land-based countries which produce these same substances and at the same time would upset the international market structure and the prices of these products.\n312.\tThe delegation of Zaire voices the wish that adequate machinery will be found to safeguard the vital interests of the developing countries which are land-based producers and that the draft Convention on the Law of the Sea will be adopted within the agreed time-frame.\n313.\tThese are the crucial problems to which the delegation of Zaire hopes the Assembly will give particular attention at its present session.\n314.\tIn the political sphere, we have stigmatized the climate of general insecurity, uncertainty and growing disarray throughout the world, the violation of the customary norms of international conduct and of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the arms race, the expansionist ambitions of the great Powers and the escalation of conflicts throughout the world.\n315.\tIn the economic sphere, the aspirations of the countries of the third world have not yet been satisfied, the gap between the North and the South is becoming ever wider and the establishment of the new international economic order continues to meet with resistance on the part of the rich countries.\n316.\tNotwithstanding this gloomy picture of humanity's prospects, I wish to reaffirm the staunch faith of the Republic of Zaire in the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which is an ideal framework for permanent conciliation and dialog to bring about solutions to the problems faced by the world. I should like to underline the primary role which the United Nations should play in the settlement of disputes, reducing international tensions and promoting conditions  favorable to the maintenance of international peace and security, progress, and the development of nations and peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a very agreeable duty and indeed a true pleasure for me to be able to associate myself with my colleagues in conveying to Mr. Kittani warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of this session. The task which has been entrusted to him is an onerous one and the responsibilities are heavy. But I am convinced that his distinguished qualities as an experienced diplomat and his extensive knowledge of the workings of the Organization, accompanied by a rare experience in international affairs, will make Mr! Kittani a President who will conduct our proceedings with competence and conviction. Loyal and constructive cooperation is something he can count on from Luxembourg.\n227.\tWithin the same context, we should like to thank most sincerely the President of the thirty-fifth session of the Genera! Assembly, Mr. von Wechmar. Throughout his presidency, which was so difficult and arduous, on more than one occasion, he displayed rare courage and tenacity which were necessary, indeed indispensable, in the face of the situations with which he was confronted.\n228.\tI should like to take this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to the SecretaryGeneral. I hope he will accept our sincere thanks for his tireless devotion to the causes which we all share and for his devoted efforts, not only for the maintenance of peace, but also for his constant commitment to the less spectacular but nonetheless necessary tasks undertaken by the Organization.\n229.\tAlthough I am new here, I do know that the Organization, if it means to satisfy its role of being a world forum, is gratified each time a new Member takes its place among us. Today it is my pleasure to extend a warm welcome to the Republic of Vanuatu, which only a few days ago became the one hundred and fifty-fifth Member of the United Nations. To these sincere congratulations I should like to add the assurance that we are for our part ready to do everything possible to increase our cooperation with the Republic of Vanuatu, in the United Nations or elsewhere.\n230.\tAt each new session the General Assembly gives us an opportunity each year to take stock of the world situation. It is also a time when the attention of our countries and of our citizens is focused, sometimes with anxiety, sometimes with hope, on the debates and problems which we undertake here.\n231.\tMy colleague, Lord Carrington, speaking on behalf of the European Community in the eighth meeting, sketched a complete outline of the policies, views and aspirations of the 10 member States. I wholeheartedly endorse those views, and I can thus confine myself to just a few comments which the world situation in 1981 suggests to the representative of a small country which has been a member of the United Nations since the very first hour of its foundation.\n232.\tTo say that everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds would, at the least, be taken for incorrigible optimism, or rather to be a display of unusual ingenuousness, if not indeed total cynicism. There have been very few years in the 36 years of the existence of the United Nations during which the international situation has been more critical, more dangerous or bristling with more explosive issues than today, as the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place.\n233.\tIn the face of this world situation, which is so discouraging, are we to resign ourselves to living in the shadow of danger contrary to the principle of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? I say no. It is true that the challenge is enormous, but it is often crisis situations which have compelled the Organization to give the best of itself, and there is plenty of evidence for this. I would even go so far as to say that it is in cases of extreme tension and imminent crisis that all of us, large and small, become even more keenly aware of the extent to which the Organization is indispensable to the survival of international society. Up to now we have succeeded together in avoiding the worst. Why should we not be able to take this crucial step which will enable us to live in peace in a world free from hatred, envy and threats?\n234.\tI am sure that some will rebuke me for exaggerated optimism and a lack of realism. Nothing of the land. My optimism, like my realism, is similar to that of the founding fathers of the Organization, neither more nor less.\n235.\tOf course it will be said that among the explosive issues it is difficult to decide which to try to defuse first. I will reply to you that this does not matter very much provided that all of us, including the chief antagonists, agree to undertake dialog, to forget our grudges, and to recognize that it is in peace and peace alone, and in respect for one's neighbor, that victory lies, and that in war and confrontation there are only losers.\n236.\tFrom this rostrum we are accustomed to speak as representatives of countries and nations. Let us not forget, however, that ultimately it is the citizens of all our countries who suffer or benefit from our successes or failures.\n237.\tA year ago the Organization welcomed Zimbabwe into membership in the great world family. The negotiations which led this State to independence, thanks to the farsightedness, courage and tenacity of the United Kingdom, the people of Zimbabwe and the front-line countries, gave us every hope that we would finally see the whole region of southern Africa achieve peace in independence and prosperity.\n238.\tUnfortunately, our hopes were dashed once again. Namibia is still illegally occupied by South Africa in spite of the many injunctions of the Organization. The initiative of the five Western members of the Security Council, endorsed by the Council in resolution 435 (1978), has so far not yielded the results hoped for because of the interminable procrastination and delaying tactics of the South African Government. We regret this very much and we appeal urgently to the Pretoria authorities to seize the opportunity to accept an equitable solution in order to lead Namibia to independence. We continue to lend every support to this initiative because we sincerely believe that it can bring about an equitable transition, free from violence and without rancor, to independence for Namibia. In this context, I must stress that we condemn the recent military incursions by South Africa into Angola.\n239.\tUnfortunately, the illegal occupation of Namibia does not constitute the only distressing problem in this long suffering part of the world. In spite of increasing pressure on the part of world public opinion, South Africa continues to pursue a racist ideology which is both unnatural and contemptible. Apartheid has never enjoyed the slightest sympathy in Luxembourg, and we will continue to urge South Africa, by .every means available to us, to give up this racist policy and to engage in the fundamental reforms which will ultimately restore to that country its right to belong to the family of nations which respect fundamental freedoms and human rights.\n240.\tSimilarly, my Government will continue to oppose the establishment of bantustans. Ghettos of this kind are not and will never constitute a solution to the serious problems of South Africa.\n241.\tSince we are meeting here to undertake a review of the situation, it should be done fearlessly, even if sometimes the dismal truths are not to everyone's liking.\n242.\tI would have liked to strike a more optimistic note in turning to the problems of the Middle East, but grim reality forces me to give up that idea. How many sincere efforts have been devoted to this part of the world, this long suffering region? How many failures have aborted these efforts before they had hardly started Happily for our world men of goodwill are not lacking, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to those who continue in spite of reverses to serve the ideals of the mission of peace of the United Nations. 1 hope that those who are contributing to the operations of the peacekeeping forces will receive this unreserved tribute. Our gratitude is also addressed to the United States and its peerless negotiator, Mr. Philip Habib. Contrary to certain allegations, we believe that the mission of this distinguished diplomat has served everyone's interest, because peace is indivisible and concerns us all.\n243., This leads me naturally to the efforts to bring about a settlement in the Middle East on a broader scale. Whether, it be the Camp David accords or, more recently, the peace ideas or plans developed by President Sadat or by Saudi Arabia, they are all valid because they are all attempts to bring about settlement of an extremely complex and delicate problem. Of course, the initiative of the European Community, which my British colleague described yesterday, still remains valid as far as we are concerned, since my predecessor, Mr. Gaston Thorn, made an initial tour of world capitals in an attempt to find a solution to this crucial problem.\n244.\tI hope that all those who are now still talking about preconditions or exceptions will think again and review their policy. A lasting peace in the Middle East is inconceivable without the following elements: the right to existence and security of all States in the area, including Israel; justice and the right to self-determination for all the peoples of the region; the withdrawal of all foreign troops from territories now occupied; the participation of all parties concerned in the drafting of an equitable peace treaty negotiated under the aegis of the United Nations.\n245.\tOf course, these requirements call for concessions on all sides, but I call upon all the parties concerned to consider whether global peace is not well worth this price.\n246.\tUnfortunately, we have recently witnessed a dangerous hardening of positions on the part of the political leaders of the countries concerned. We very much regret this, because here again, far from benefiting either side, such attitudes only serve to exacerbate a situation which is already all too explosive and to increase the suffering and hardships of the peoples concerned.\n247.\tWe deeply regret the new escalation of violence in Lebanon. Luxembourg has always supported international appeals for the preservation of a sovereign Lebanon whose integrity and territorial unity would be guaranteed.\n248.\tAs for the conflict in Cyprus, I should like to express the sincere hope that negotiations will lead the two communities towards a harmonious solution to that conflict. We welcome the work being done in Cyprus to achieve this by the representatives of the Secretary General.\n249.\tSouthEast Asia is another part of our turbulent world in which situations of armed conflict are continuing, to the detriment not only of detente, but also of the wellbeing of peoples who, over the past decades, have suffered all too much. Unfortunately, the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea still remain on our agenda.\n250.\tNeither the resolutions of the Assembly nor international conferences have succeeded in easing the situation in any way, although they have done no more than appeal for common sense, for dialog and for negotiations that will enable all the parties to save face.\n251.\tWhy, I wonder, does the USSR persist in occupying an Afghanistan that is hostile to its ideological and expansionist designs? How many human and material resources are needed in the attempt to prove, in defiance of world public opinion, that intervention is ever justified? Apart from the fact that such interventions are contrary to the fundamental principles set forth in the Charter, such acts and interventions and here I am speaking on behalf of all the people of Luxembourg are contrary to the most elementary human rights. Why cannot the initiative taken by the 10 member States of the European Communities\\\" constitute at least a first step towards a solution? That initiative does, in any case, represent an honest attempt, inspired solely by a sincere desire for peace in that region.\n252.\tThe same observations apply, perhaps with some qualifications, to the situation in Kampuchea. There Viet Nam has used the pretext of an inhumane and genocidal regime, established in a country deserving of peace and economic and social progress, to attempt to alter the normal course of history. Against the will of the population, it is attempting to impose a puppet regime on a people resistant both to the exactions of the Pol Pot government and to the caprices of neighbors rather too eager to turn it into an earthly paradise.\n253.\tI do not want to overlook here, in the United Nations, a problem that is becoming more serious every day and that is of serious concern to us the problem of refugees, whether in SouthEast Asia, Africa or on the Latin American continent. Instead of seeing a lessening of violence and injustice, in accordance with the Charter, we are seeing new outbreaks of blind violence, often accompanied by a total collapse of democratic values.\n254.\tI have mentioned only some of the major problems that have for years been of constant concern to world opinion. Unfortunately, there are others, which have been dealt with by my British colleague, who spoke yesterday on behalf of the 10 members of the European Communities. Yet I would be remiss were I not to touch briefly on some economic problems which at the present time are at the forefront of our leaders' concerns.\n255.\tIn the last decade, our world has had to deal with a vicious circle of recessions followed by periods of inflation and social instability which, in turn, have given rise to restrictive policies. Fortunately, we have thus far succeeded in stifling the protectionist impulses that are the inevitable consequence of such economic phenomena. We must persist in this course and overcome our problems, even though insecurity and disorder in the monetary sector have not made our task any easier.\n256.\tAll these elements, which are fundamentally unfavorable to any attempt to revive the world economy, and even more unfavorable to a rapid establishment of what we have come to call the new international economic order, have certainly not helped to improve the international atmosphere: We should; however, be gratified that in spite of these disappointments, this lack of progress, the dialog between the industrialized; and the developing countries has not been interrupted.\n257.\tTwo international conferences, one on hew and renewable sources of energy, held at Nairobi, and the other on the least developed countries, held in Paris that have taken place since the unfortunate delay in what has been termed the global negotiations have amply demonstrated that there are still enough people of goodwill who, far from allowing themselves to be discouraged by temporary setbacks, tirelessly persist in their search for solutions to particular problems for want of finding a global solution.\n258.\tIn this connection, I personally prefer to seek specific solutions that will be suited to the interdependence that is inevitable in the world of the future, rather than merely philosophizing on notions such as global negotiations or the new international economic order.\n259.\tI am personally convinced that these actions and ideas are complementary and should ultimately come to mean the same thing. In this belief, I remain convinced that \\\"interdependence\\\" stands for a specific idea, both from the economic and commercial standpoint and from the humanitarian and social standpoint. However, I fear that references to global negotiations and to the new international economic order alone will quite mistakenly give rise in some quarters to doubts and misgivings, and consequently to a reluctant attitude. This would be a pity and contrary to our wishes and our commitments.\n260.\tWhatever label is attached to the many economic discussions now under way, they certainly constitute a gigantic undertaking. Much progress has been achieved, but much remains to be done, and ultimate success has so far eluded us. Responsibility for this state of affairs, regrettable in itself, can in no way land at the door of Mr. von Wechmar. I should like to take this opportunity to tell him how much we have appreciated his commitment to such an eminently just cause and how much we have admired his perseverance, his courage and his gifts as an experienced negotiator throughout the long and difficult dealings of the past year.\n261.\tIt is now the task of the new President to take up the torch and to do his very best to conclude the work of giving our world an economic system that would be more just and more productive for everyone.\n262.\tLuxembourg has always encouraged fair and beneficial cooperation. In the association between the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the European Communities, we have seen an original method of promoting cooperation among nations that share the same ideals and objectives. Ever since the first association between the European Communities and the Associated African and Malagasy States, we have given every support to this undertaking and shall continue to do So. Similarly, we shall not be found wanting when our Organization continues its efforts to settle economic problems at the world level.\n263.\tIn reviewing these problems and offering certain reflections on them, we must agree that the world situation is hardly encouraging. Of course there are some encouraging elements in all this. There are also problems in regard to which the Organization can be proud of having, if not finally settled conflicts or disputes, at least embarked on processes making it possible to hope for a satisfactory outcome.\n264.\tI do not wish to conclude on too pessimistic a note with regard to the results of the work of the Organization. As in the past, the United Nations is indispensable for the survival of the world and will remain so. Its work, apart from certain major problems, which unfortunately are in the focus of world attention, seems to us to be particularly useful and constructive inasmuch as it is carried out in large measure without any publicity and for the benefit cf all our citizens. In this regard it is a pleasure for me to be able to say to the SecretaryGeneral how much we esteem him and how much we appreciate his devotion and his commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter. That is true also for all those who, under his enlightened leadership, in the Secretariat, devote themselves to championing our common ideals.\n265.\tThese considerations lead me quite naturally to share with the Assembly a thought which seems to me to apply to all our problems at the present time, whether they concern political or economic matters.\n266.\tThere are in our societies universal laws and imperatives applicable to the whole international community, whatever may be its ideology or religion. Those who believe that they can , change these rules with impunity, because at the time they seem to be contrary to their current Interests, are seriously mistaken.\n267.\tOur generation created modern civilization with its promises, but also with its threats. It is for us to fulfill the promises, which are immense, and to ward off the threats and dangers, which are no less so. Future generations, believe me, will judge us, and they will judge us severely.\n"

        "file_text": "141.On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Zambia, it gives me great pleasure to join those who have spoken before me in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. May your leadership ensure that the outcome of this session strengthens the collective efforts of mankind to bring about a better world.\n142.\tMy delegation commends your predecessor, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, for the excellent manner in which he presided over the work of the thirty-fifth session and the eighth emergency special session, devoted to the question of Namibia.\n143.\tThe SecretaryGeneral has continued to work with dedication in the service of the United Nations. I convey to him my delegation's appreciation of his efforts in working for world peace and security.\n144.\tLet me take this opportunity to welcome the new nations of Vanuatu and Belize on their admission into the United Nations. We rejoice, because once again the United Nations has moved closer to the realization of the much-cherished principle of universality of membership.\n145.\tOnce again we meet at a time when the world is confronted with growing international tension, heightened bloc rivalry, the escalation of the arms race, the persistence of regional hotbeds of crisis and the creation of new conflicts in various parts of the world, the continuing illegal occupation of other people's lands and the unabated evils of apartheid and racism. The major Powers seem powerless to block or put an end to the arms race, growing violence, armed intervention or aggression and violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other States, domination of others, inequity and injustice in the world.\n146.\tIn the quest to become \\\"the greatest\\\", some of them have become blind to the cause of freedom, independence, justice and equality for all the peoples of the world. Indeed, they shamefully support and sustain regimes that thrive on the savage repression and degradation of other human beings on the grounds of color and race and which deny others freedom, independence or a homeland. These circumstances, some of which provide a basis for glaring violations of human rights, threaten world peace and security.\n147.\tIt has been said that the emergence after the Second World War of two major Powers with antagonistic systems has played a significant role in the militarization of the world: The competition between these Powers has undoubtedly affected most parts of the globe. Thus, while it is true that today the two Powers are not actually directly at war with each other anywhere in the world, they are embroiled in a number of potentially explosive situations and, in fact, keep alive the many armed conflicts taking place between and among the small, poor countries of the developing world. The possible emancipation of States from military and political alliances clearly does not suit the interests of the great Powers, which strive hard, using every possible means, to frustrate the endeavor. Their stranglehold is causing a great deal of hardship to the small and poor nations concerned. The situation needs to be corrected.\n148.\tThere can be no doubt that the greatest threat to mankind today is the existence and continuing development of devastating nuclear weapons. An overwhelming majority of the world's peoples certainly does not possess or desire nuclear arms. They do not have the technological capability or the necessary resources to develop and produce these weapons. And we are back to the great Powers of our time and a few other countries. It is the Governments of these countries that hold the world hostage to their possession of nuclear weapons. It is these countries that are engaged in the never-ending quest for the development of advanced nuclear weaponry, and it is the Governments of these countries that must inevitably play a decisive role to rid mankind of the nightmare of worldwide nuclear devastation. Although the nuclear arms race affects the security of all States, it is clear that the two major nuclear-weapon States the United States and the Soviet Union will have to take the lead in the nuclear disarmament process.\n149.\tI now turn t\\\" the situation in southern Africa. Here we confront three major problems: that of the freedom and independence of Namibia, that of apartheid and majority rule in South Africa and that of South Africa's destabilization of neighboring independent States.\n150.\tThe problem of Namibia is one of colonialism and illegal occupation by South Africa, in arrogant defiance of the international community and of the various United Nations resolutions and decisions on the matter. Against the background of a momentous and impressive record of decolonization since the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)] some 21 years ago, the world community cannot but be indignant at the posture and actions of South Africa with regard to Namibia's freedom and independence. South Africa must be made to realize that the right of people to self-determination, sovereignty and independence is a universal quest of mankind and is exercised throughout the progressive world. There can be no turning the clock back in Namibia. Freedom and genuine independence will come to Namibia and soon, at that.\n151.\tSouth Africa and its supporters are laboring under the delusion that they can exclude SWAPO from the solution of the Namibian problem in favor of a puppet regime and that they will be able to preserve existing colonial and racist relations in Namibia. The recent victory of the people of Zimbabwe has proved that no amount of force by the oppressor, or chicanery through bogus internal settlement, can prevent a people from choosing a government that is responsive to its real needs and aspirations. As an authentic liberation movement, SWAPO \ncannot lose the battle under any circumstances, whatever the balance of power may be.\n152.\tThe continued illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa not only is intolerable but also constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. We have a viable plan for the liberation of Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), It is in everyone's interest that appropriate pressure should be brought to bear on South Africa to cooperate fully with the United Nations in its efforts to solve the Namibian problem. Zambia reaffirms its total support for and solidarity with SWAPO, the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.\n153.\tIn our view, which is shared by many others, the five-member Western contact group, which initiated the plan for the independence of Namibia, bears a special responsibility to prevail upon the recalcitrant Pretoria regime to accept the plan as it is so that Namibia can finally achieve its independence. Members of the group certainly possess enormous influence and leverage over South Africa. We are not satisfied that they have exerted sufficient pressure on South Africa to ensure its cooperation in the implementation of the United Nations plan on the independence of Namibia as envisaged in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We call upon them to do so.\n154.\tIn South Africa itself, the practice of racism, repression, oppression, deprivation and state terrorism against the nonwhite majority has now given rise to the heightened militancy and increased combat capacity of the oppressed segment of the population. This militancy is eloquent evidence of the current state and direction of the liberation struggle against apartheid and minority rule. The African nationalists and freedom fighters are no longer afraid of the much-vaunted military superiority of the apartheid regime. This clear defiance of military superiority by the forces of national liberation is indicative of the fact that the will of oppressed people shall not be thwarted, even under the most brutal military machine Africa has ever known.\n155.\tThe policy of apartheid has universally been condemned as an evil one and a crime against humanity. It can only be practiced, supported and sustained by evil men. We must, therefore, strive to dismantle the apartheid structure quickly. The international community should, accordingly, welcome, encourage and support the heightened struggle of the oppressed people of South Africa for the eradication of apartheid. This solidarity with the oppressed people of South Africa should be manifested in an intensified international campaign for the ostracism of the Pretoria regime, as well as through material assistance to the liberation movements in South Africa.\n156.\tThe situation in southern Africa is also one that directly endangers the peace, security and independence of African countries in the neighborhood of South Africa. Thus, the racist South African regime has been committing and continues to commit wanton acts of aggression against Angola, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia, mainly because those countries play essential roles as secure rear bases for the liberation struggle in southern Africa. The recent South African aggression against Angola has been particularly vicious and on an unprecedented scale. Now even newly independent Zimbabwe is being threatened by South Africa.\n157.\tSouth Africa is also fomenting dissension within neighboring independent States. To that end, it is giving military training to dissident groups from those States with a view to overthrowing their legitimate Governments, which are opposed to the evil system of apartheid and support the liberation struggle in the region. In addition, South Africa continues to recruit mercenaries to work against the neighboring countries.\n158.\tSouth Africa's aim in all those actions is the de stabilization of sovereign and independent African States in southern Africa. We strongly condemn South Africa for all those actions. We also wish to register our great indignation in regard to those Western Powers which are responsible for sustaining the apartheid system through their political, diplomatic, ideological, economic, strategic and other forms of collaboration and support.\n159.\tThere is another dimension of the southern African situation which my delegation wishes to underscore. This relates to the fact that the atmosphere of oppression, repression and war that obtains in the area has led to an exodus of people as refugees from South Africa and Namibia into neighboring countries in search of peaceful sanctuary. At the same time, the vicious act of aggression committed by South Africa against Angola has resulted in a severe displacement of people. Both the refugees and the displaced people represent a human tragedy of vast proportions brought about by the racist South African regime. We call upon the international community not only to condemn South Africa for causing the tragedy but also to come urgently to the assistance of the victims of the tragedy.\n160.\tIt is clear that all those problems of southern Africa have been brought about and are kept alive by the apartheid regime in South Africa. It is equally clear to us that, with the support it receives from certain Western countries, the racist South African regime has been enabled to build up its growing military power and machinery of subjugation, to defy international public opinion, and to increase its intransigence. We therefore hold those countries equally responsible for the tragic situation that we confront in southern Africa a situation that is certainly a serious threat to world peace and security.\n161.\tOnce again we wish to state that peaceful change in South Africa and peaceful resolution of the Namibian problem are possible. South Africa's aggression against Angola and illegal occupation of parts of its territory must end quickly. South Africa must be made to realize that its destabilization of neighboring independent States will not stop the internal struggle inside South Africa itself against apartheid and minority rule by the oppressed masses of that country. It is our conviction that the Western Powers and friends of South Africa have and can exert sufficient leverage over that country to facilitate the elimination of apartheid, to bring about desired change and majority rule in South Africa, to compel South Africa to relinquish its stranglehold on Namibia so that the Territory can secure its freedom and genuine independence, to compel South Africa to get its troops out of Angola, and to ensure that the peace, security and independence of the front-line and other affected neighboring States cease to \nbe threatened. We call upon those Western Powers to do so in the name of our common humanity.\n162.\tI now wish to refer to one other crisis area in Africa, namely, Western Sahara. The incomplete task of decolonization in Western Sahara has given rise to a situation fraught with tension. At the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Nairobi in June, a decision was taken to hold a referendum on the future of the disputed Territory [see Al361534, annex II, resolution AHG/Res. 103 (XVIII)]. We call upon all concerned to support the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in implementing that decision.\n163.\tMy delegation is very much concerned about the unending conflict in the Middle East. This situation has been brought about by Israel's policy of aggression, expansionism and colonial settlement in the occupied Arab territories. As in the case of South Africa vis-a-vis Namibia, we are confronted with Israel's continuing defiance of the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations. Again as in the case of South Africa's aggression against neighboring countries, the situation in the Middle East has become more explosive than ever before because of Israel's latest military adventurism against the sovereign States of Lebanon and Iraq not to mention its repression of the people of Palestine.\n\n164.\tAn imperative condition for defusing the highly volatile situation and establishing enduring peace in this area is the immediate withdrawal of Israel from all illegally occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, and the restoration to the Palestinian people of their inalienable national rights, including their right to a State of their own in their homeland. Together with such a withdrawal, there would also be the need to establish appropriate arrangements to guarantee the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States in the region. In this connection, Israel would be expected to adhere to the unconditional cessation of its intransigence and military adventurism in the area.\n165.\tThe PLO is the authentic representative of the Palestinian people. As such, the PLO should be an equal partner in any serious negotiations to resolve the question of Palestine, which is the crux of the Middle East saga.\n166.\tMy delegation wishes to express its profound regret that, in spite of the efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the United Nations and the non aligned movement, the armed conflict between Iran and Iraq continues with no end in sight. We appeal to both Iran and Iraq to end the war between them and thus put an end to the loss of human life, the destruction of property and the impediment to their development. They should resort to the exercise of finding a just and honourable settlement of the dispute through negotiations, as has been urged upon them by various international bodies and peace missions. The continuation of the war could well give a pretext to outside Powers to intervene and thereby enlarge the conflagration.\n167.\tDuring the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, my delegation joined in the call for an urgent resolution of the Afghanistan crisis [resolution 35/37], Today, that crisis is still with us. I therefore wish to reiterate my delegation's call at that session [70th meeting] for an urgent end to the crisis by having all foreign troops withdrawn from that country without any preconditions and by recourse to a political solution.\n168.\tAnother crisis situation which exercised the attention of the General Assembly during its thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth sessions is that of Kampuchea. We call for an urgent political solution to the problem.\n169.\tWith regard to the Korean peninsula, we strongly support efforts for the peaceful reunification of Korea and once again call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea.\n170.\tWe are encouraged by the resumption of inter-communal talks on the question of Cyprus under the auspices of the SecretaryGeneral. We hope that the talks will lead to the resolution of the conflict that has afflicted that country for too long. Above all, any settlement of the question of Cyprus should be based on the principles of the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and nonaligned status of that country.\n171.\tMy delegation notes with extreme disquiet that the question of declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace is still unresolved. In the meantime, the situation in and around the Indian Ocean is fraught with danger owing to the emergence of an arms race and superPower rivalry for the military control of the region. We reiterate our position, calling upon the great Powers to initiate the elimination from the Indian Ocean region of all their bases, military installations, logistical supply facilities, the disposition of weapons of mass destruction and any manifestations of greatPower military presence conceived in the context of greatPower rivalry. We further urge the holding of the Conference on the Indian Ocean in accordance with General Assembly resolution 35/150. That Conference, which was supposed to have taken place during the course of this year, was vehemently opposed and frustrated by certain Western Powers on dubious grounds concerning the harmonization of views as a precondition.\n172.\tIn the economic sphere, there can be no doubt as to the seriousness of the present situation and the hardships it has brought to the majority of countries. The rich industrialized countries are, to a very considerable extent, to blame for the present malaise in the world economic situation. We are witnessing increased resistance on the part of these countries to structural change. Thus, many of them are unwilling to work for a new international economic order in which interdependence between nations can become more meaningful. They have frustrated the NorthSouth dialog because they want to maintain the status quo in which the poor would remain poor and the rich would get richer.\n173.\tThose who care to be objective must concede that the present economic order has brought the world into a dangerously polarized state of inequality. Underdevelopment and the resultant conditions of poverty, deprivation and diminished human potential everywhere, which the present economic order certainly perpetuates, pose serious dangers to us all. There can be no doubt that the present economic relations in the world are a serious impediment to the development efforts of many nations, particularly those in the developing world.\n174.\tIt has been argued that the insistence by the developing countries on the elimination of longstanding world inequities is tantamount to a demand that the inhabitants of the industrialized countries should give up the fruits of the progress which they have achieved in the last two centuries. This is a mistaken defensive stance on the part of the developed countries. What is being demanded is quite different: it is that they should have more of the fruits of an internationally progressive, peaceful and amiable world m Which we can all participate, not by taking, but by fair and rational exchange. It is not charity that is being sought, but international cooperation, solidarity and justice.\n175.\tIt is against this background that we call for the urgent commencement of global negotiations aimed at evolving a coherent and integrated approach to the solutions of major problems concerning international economic relations and the world economy as a whole.\nA\n176.\tIt can thus be seen that international relations are at present at a crossroads. There is a need to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to find, through joint efforts and by negotiations, solutions to the major international problems, or to face an even deeper crisis. We must admit that the gravity of the moment and the importance of the task to be undertaken in order to overcome present political, economic and social problems will require a sense of increased responsibility and willingness to search for genuine and longterm solutions.\n177.\tThe United Nations has a vital role to play in the search for solutions to these problems. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us all to demonstrate our political will in our collective efforts to realize the lofty aims and objectives of this world body.\n178.\tZambia for its part reaffirms its faith in the United Nations, We also pledge to continue to support the Organization in its important mission to save mankind from the scourge of war and to achieve for all the people of the world political, economic and social justice.\n"

        "file_text": "212.\tI wish to convey to the President the congratulations of my delegation on his appointment to this high international office. I am sure that his appointment has brought satisfaction to his countrymen. I am further sure that he will discharge the duties and responsibilities of his office in such a manner as to warrant the confidence, respect and admiration of all in the Assembly.\n213.\tI wish also to express my congratulations to the outgoing President for what, I am informed, is the very able manner in which he conducted the affairs of the Assembly during his term in office. I look forward to his continued valued contribution on behalf of his country to the. work and to the vitality of the Assembly.\n214.\tAs She youngest Member country, up until very recently, may I now take the opportunity to congratulate Vanuatu and Belize on their attainment of independence and admission to this world body. I shall speak farther on Belize at a later stage.\n215.\tNo one who assumes the burdens of office does so without the hope of leaving some positive achievement at the end of his tenure. It is therefore my hope that during the course of this year many of the serious issues confronting this world body may come to a negotiated settlement. The ideas which were the precursors of the United Nations and its predecessor the League of Nations were intended to resolve international disputes and harmonize national differences by peaceful means and not by force of arms. \n216.\tTwice the world has seen major wars fought on land, sea and air. Twice the world has recoiled from the horrors of those wars. Yet today we still refuse to learn from those experiences. In the past, after each major holocaust of death, suffering and destruction, mankind has stopped at the edge of the abyss it had created and surveyed it. Through such surveys and after such reflections, leading thinkers found the will to resolve that it should not happen again. The tragedy of wars is that the people who suffer or might suffer most are never the ones who make the decisions, and those decisions are often the results of ambition, dreams of the future, national pride and perceived interests.\n217.\tIt is the taking of such decisions which now causes the work of the President and the work of the Assembly to be so much more complex and challenging. Because of these decisions there are growing and continuing conflicts in several areas of the world. Man seems to have ceased his quest for peace. Nations seem to forget that in wars all are, losers. The ever-costly, crushing burdens of military preparedness, the increased costs of expenditure in a conflict, the loss of life and property, the squandering of resources of all kinds these are the high price that is paid.\n218.\tIt is becoming increasingly evident that some world leaders are preoccupied with the resolution of issues on the battlefield and outside the realm of diplomacy. Time is running out and we must ask ourselves how we can best cause the Assembly to serve its original purpose that of preserving the wellbeing of all mankind. How can it best contribute to the diplomatic process by bringing nations in a dispute to the conference table, whether before they are combatants or after? The question is: do all members of the Assembly have the will to make this possible?\n219.\tI am aware that this world body has had notable success in calming tempers and separating the combatants in many parts of the world. I am aware that the intentions and actions of the Assembly have often been frustrated by the Security Council. Perhaps it is as well that this world body be reminded that a house divided in its purpose and intent cannot long stand, will not survive.\n220.\tUnless and until this world body receives the fullest cooperation and support of all Members, particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, we all may despair about being merely involved in an international talking club capable of identifying suitable subjects in need of urgent international attention, then debating those subjects and adopting resolutions and decisions knowing full well that that adoption represents the totality of its efforts.\n221.\tSaint Vincent and the Grenadines cannot accept that this must be the ultimate destiny of this world body. We believe in the principles it was intended to serve. We believe that those principles represent admirable human ideals, which are attainable. We believe that no Member has the right deliberately to frustrate the attainment of those ideals.\n222.\tI am aware that issues can at times be very complex and may be in need of careful analysis and debate so that a just decision can be reached. However, can anyone truly explain why Namibia should not become independent? Can anyone on any basis of principle say why foreign troops should by occupying Afghanistan and Kampuchea, in spite of broadly based opposition to then presence by a vast majority of the population? Can anyone say that the holding of free and fair elections is not the most appropriate manner to determine the will of the majority? Is it not time immediately to bring to an end those unjust conflicts of repression and the bloodshed and suffering of peoples whose only fault lies in their desire to be left in peace to determine their own future, whose only fault lies in their refusal to accept that a minority, without the endorsement of the majority, should govern them, either with or without foreign troops, to accept that might is right and that they must therefore be cowed into submission and so have no hope of enjoying that freedom that many of us know and have often taken for granted?\n223.\tIt would appear that just as the work of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples is coming to an end, another invidious and subtle type of colonialism is rearing its brutal head.\n224.\tThese are some of the serious issues which I hope this world body may be able to resolve during the President's term in office.\n225.\tSaint Vincent and the Grenadines further hopes that the present dispute between Iraq and Iran can be resolved at the negotiating table. To be ready and willing to negotiate should not be interpreted by either side as a sign of weakness, but rather as a realistic assessment that through the continuation of conflict national energies are diverted from their true purpose, which is to build the economies of the two countries and improve the standard of living of their two peoples. This is equally true of the situation in Central America, where the parties to the conflict should end the cycle of violence, renounce the resolution of differences by force of arms, discuss issues and decide on the type of constitution which their country should have, and implement the provisions of the constitution with free and fair elections, democratically supervised under the aegis of the United Nations. Life is the greatest gift bestowed upon mankind. Man, therefore, should not through indifference make himself his own exterminator.\n226.\tIt is for that reason that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines supports the call not only for arms control but also for arms reduction. It is unrealistic for any country to assume that people who are fearful of it and its intentions will indefinitely permit undue superiority in the means of waging war once they have the resources and the capability to redress that imbalance. It is one thing to wish to have parity, it is another to have superiority, for that superiority may, not unreasonably, be perceived by others as a direct threat to their own security. It is the existence of that superiority which creates the arms race that no one wants and that the world could do without.\n227.\tIt is a sad thing when the siege mentality creates the illusion that peace can only be achieved by preparation for war, that the more massive the striking force, the greater the deterrent and the better the guarantee of peace. \nThe question is whose peace, what peace? A peace that creates as much fear as war is no peace. It is the lethal nature of the weapons available that will create the fear. The corollary would be the phased elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. The reduction of conventional forces, with inspection, would also create a better climate for peace. Such a peace, assured by reduced comparable strength, would not create the fear among others that obtains today.\n228.\tIn a world of thermonuclear weapons no one is safe. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines therefore supports the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We do so because we support the argument the that greater the capability of the manufacture of fissionable material the greater the likelihood that there will be an ever-widening spread of the stockpiling of weapons and the greater the risk of miscalculation, which may draw others unwillingly into a global conflict. We are concerned because the existence of nuclear weapons everywhere poses a direct threat to everyone everywhere. Just as the aeroplane's speed has shrunk the world, the destructive force of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, with their delivery systems, has shrunk land area and distance. It is for this reason that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has a committed as well as a concerned interest in the settlement of disputes through the art of diplomacy.\n229.\tBut besides our preoccupation with peace in the world, we are even more committed to the improvement of the standard of living of our people not only the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines but all peoples of small States with highly vulnerable economies, often dependent upon a single crop and in most cases without any mineral resources. In such a struggle for survival it is not unreasonable to expect that small States will hope that those who are able to assist will do so.\n230.\tToday, bananas are the single most important crop of the Windward Islands and in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines represent over 60 per cent of our exports. At present the existence of that crop is threatened by legal proceedings now before the British High Court against the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries by an interested party who seeks to ensure that no protection is given to Windward Islands bananas on the United Kingdom market and that importers be free to purchase bananas from dollar sources. It is also threatened for other reasons. The fall of sterling against the United States dollar has caused a drop in the price to the farmers. Increased production has resulted in inadequate shipping space, which has created financial problems for the Banana Association that commercial banks may not be able to bear indefinitely. If that legal action were to be successful, its adverse consequences would be far greater than the effects of hurricanes David and Allen upon our several economies. We are aware that the Government of the United Kingdom is mindful of this present danger and we hope that every effort will be made to safeguard the interests of Windward Islands bananas.\n231.\tThe volume of our combined weekly exports is small compared with that of other producers, but our dependence on it for our economic wellbeing is far greater.\nThe demise of the industry would be an economic calamity. In addition to protection for our bananas, we need access to the markets of developed economies for certain specified crops at an agreed and guaranteed price and volume.\n232.\tThe real and constant preoccupation of the small States of the Eastern Caribbean is the fight against the forces of nature and the constant battle for economic survival. It is true that many countries have given financial assistance to enable my country, as well as others in the Eastern Caribbean, to overcome some of the difficulties which nature or our own small size have made it impossible for us to overcome on our own. However, the problems of poverty are multi-faceted. Because of our grinding poverty, where expenditure should often be less, it has to be more. The question is: how is this? Last year I made this observation and I do so again: What is usually a priority for remedying the plight of small and poor States can be, and is, identified by those on the spot who are better able to see the problems which are constraints upon development.\n233.\tYet, in spite of identification, these problems remain perennial, notwithstanding the obvious importance to the process of national development if they are resolved. hi a world of high inflationary trends, project costs are forever rising, while far too much money is being spent on the conduct of repetitious studies, often calculated to serve their own ends, on subjects that are obviously imperative if the economies of small States are to escape the cycle of poverty, desperation and dependence. We live in a world where everyone even the Oil producing countries speaks about conserving energy and oil, about exploiting alternative sources than oil, about identifying and tapping renewable sources of energy. If I may say so, this is indeed commendable. This is a laudable objective, for there is no prudent reason to squander a valuable and finite resource, for which there will always be a need, when there is an alternative which is continuously being renewed and, far better still, is cheaper. The uses to which oil could be put are many and, notwithstanding conservation, are increasing in many parts of the world. It is therefore obvious that so valuable a fUel should be conserved for the future needs of mankind and, where possible and financially practicable, other sources of energy should be exploited.\n234.\tI should like now to indicate how poverty places a heavy burden on poor States and how the poor become poorer because there is no surplus wealth to generate development of their country. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, electricity is generated by diesel and hydro power. In 1980, 10,020,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were generated from hydro-power, at a cost of 336,000 East Caribbean dollars. In the same year, 15,734,000 kilowatt-hours of diesel-powered electricity were generated at a cost of 4,106,000 East Caribbean dollars. It cost 3,770,000 East Caribbean dollars per annum more to generate 5,714,000 kilowatts of power from diesel fuel. It is this type of arithmetic which we cannot connect on our own and which crushes us into helplessness, making the poor poorer. Someone has to carry this very big differential in generating costs, and it is the consumer who does so. \n235.\tThe projection of the differential for 1984 is even more staggering; it will be 9,663,000 East Caribbean dollars. The capital cost of hydroelectric installations is higher than diesel costs to generate the equivalent amount of energy, but in five years, through savings on hydroelectric generation, the capital cost differential will be recovered without taking into consideration the normal benefit from profits. There exists water availability to exploit our hydro potential further. For years we have been endeavoring to secure financing for the project. For years the costs have been rising. In June this year we received assurances of finance for the construction stage of the project. The project is now delayed at the design stage because costs have increased by several hundred thousand dollars.\n236.\tIt is these special problems of poverty and underdevelopment in small States such as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to which urgent and special attention must be given special assistance in the area of economic development and disaster relief. I am aware that in the Assembly there are those who can assist us to find solutions to these problems.\n237.\tThere are other areas in our development plan which must be addressed if we are to rise above our present circumstances, notwithstanding the progress already made areas of improvement in our air and sea communications. These are imperatives if our tourist and industrial potential is to be fully realized. I know these are economic matters which are more appropriately discussed elsewhere, but I believe they should also be mentioned here.\n238.\tIt is for that reason that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would welcome any initiative seeking to.promote the economic wellbeing of the region by the injection of foreign capital, whether in the public or private sectors. However, there must be an interplay of investment in both sectors, even if greater emphasis is put on one of them. It is the proper functioning of both which will demonstrate the complementary nature of each. The private sector would function better if there is proper education, training, agricultural inputs and infrastructure.\n2?9. The gap between the North and the South, the rich and the poor, is ever widening. I perceive that there is now awareness of that fact. I am aware too that to varying degrees all countries are beset by economic ills. The strong, however, are better able than the weak to absorb shocks and take corrective measures, and they should lend a helping hand. But as the weak become stronger, that strength will promote the greater economic vitality of the strong.\n240.\tThe rich and the poor are both in a partnership of development; hence I look forward with hope and expectation to the early realization of the new initiative for the benefit of the Caribbean Basin countries. A worthy idea is worthy of prompt execution.\n241.\tSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has been proud to be associated with the admission of Belize to the Organization, not only because We have evolved out of the same colonial experiences, tradition and mores but also because we have close historical human ties. Because of that spirit of freedom which exists within the hearts of all mankind, men who fought for their homeland, and lost after the death of their Chief \\\"Chatoyer\\\", were deported with their women and children to Roatan and British Honduras, now Belize. Some descendants of those lovers of their country and of freedom, the \\\"Black Caribs\\\" of Saint Vincent, are today citizens of an independent Belize, though a cloud still hangs over its freedom. At the thirty-fifth session in my address to the Assembly [5th meeting] I urged that this world body use its not inconsiderable influence to ensure that Belize proceed to independence without delay. That this has been possible during this session is an occasion for satisfaction to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The Assembly and the United Kingdom must now be complimented on the decisive action taken.\n242.\tIt was not too much to have hoped, after some apparent success resulting from protracted tripartite negotiations earlier this year, that Guatemala might have joined the United Kingdom in sponsoring the admission of Belize as a fitting tribute to the settlement of this territorial dispute of an historical nature which started at a time when men carved empires out of aboriginal territories, based either on conquest, cession or settlement. Today Belize proclaims its independence in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, which recognizes the inalienable right of all colonial peoples to be free to plan their own destiny. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines supports that right. The United Nations, in keeping with the Charter, should guarantee that right.\n243.\tThere is another festering colonial legacy which concerns the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela a dispute which seeks to emasculate Guyana very seriously. It is a matter of grave concern for any Government to be confronted with a claim, whether invalid or valid, on so large an area of territory.\n244.\tIt is a dispute that must be resolved: it cannot be merely swept under the mat of international opinion for us thereafter to pretend that it does not exist; for it does exist. We cannot, here in the Assembly, play ostrich and bury our heads in the sand, while leaving other parts exposed to the fury of the storm. This dispute has already affected the developmental efforts of Guyana, which that poor country cannot afford; whereas the dispute, so far as we are aware, does not affect the developmental efforts of Venezuela. I believe it is the duty of the Assembly to try \\\"to resolve this dispute, to bring the parties to the conference table in order to reach a final solution consistent with reality. Parties on opposite sides of a chasm cannot meet unless they build a bridge. Guyana is entitled to an internationally settled future it can build on. \n245.\tI am saddened that the Convention on the Law of the Sea has not been concluded. It is the hope of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines that all obstacles to its signing will be overcome and the Convention made final within the President's term of office. It is important for small States such as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to know their entitlements to jurisdiction and the resources of the sea, and to know that through the force of a treaty they carry the stamp of approval of this world body a body whose responsibility it is, ultimately, to safeguard and protect the interests of all States, but in particular small States which do not have the strength, resources and influence to protect their own interests.\n246. I wish to speak now in some detail on the Namibian issue and to repeat parts of my statement circulated in the Assembly early in September during the emergency special session on Namibia:\n\\\"The people of this world cannot be part free and part slaves, and if this world body does not consistently exert itself to ensure that rights which people take for granted in many parts of the globe become the inalienable rights of all mankind it will ultimately become as useless as its predecessor; the League of Nations.\n\\\"A debate on Namibia is not only a debate on the very serious issue of the right of a colonial people to self-determination, to build their own institutions, to set their own standards, to educate themselves, to establish their own developmental priorities or determine their own friends, but also a debate on the future of this institution itself. For South Africa's challenge to the authority of this institution for challenge its is strikes at the very foundation of this institution. For the strength of this institution is dependent on respect for its authority and its ability to persuade [States to comply] with its decisions. The Assembly belongs to us. We are the Assembly. What the United Nations is is what we are. We are each several parts of this whole and we are, through this Assembly, what we represent in the sum total of our efforts.\n(4\n\\\"There is a need for peace in Namibia. There is need for an end to this vicious circle of suffering and death. South Africa holds the real answer to the question of peace. What is needed is South Africa's appreciation that it will inevitably have to relinquish administrative control over Namibia. It is in a confrontation which it cannot win, only prolong, and, in the process [prolong] the agony of the majority of a people the birth-pains of the nation.\ni<\n. . The question is: where do we go from here? What options do we have left? How must we find a solution to the present impasse? What further action should we take to make the blinkered South African Government change its present confrontational course and return to the path of understanding, prudence, negotiation and a peaceful settlement of this conflict?\n\\\"For what exists between South Africa and this Assembly is not a dispute, for a dispute suggests that there is some debatable right which exists. The most that South Africa has ever had was administrative control in trust for the inhabitants. It must know it has no other right. What it has is a conflict of interests and a duty. Those interests are racial, economic and strategic. The duty it believes it owes is to its own racial minority in South Africa, but its duty, rather, is to the people of Namibia, for whom the Territory is held in trust. This is all an academic exercise of which we are and, I am sure, South Africa is aware, but South Africa chooses to ignore [this].\n\\\"Member Governments with influence should launch a diplomatic offensive to convince South Africa that it is in its own longterm economic and security interests to resolve the Namibian question by an election, and that if [it] failed to heed the request [it] would be alone and isolated.\n\\\"Should this approach fail, a committee should be appointed by this Assembly to consider further options to be exercised.\\\"4\n247.\tHow can we in this world body also bring peace and unity between divided countries so that brothers can learn to dwell together in harmony? I am aware that to achieve such results may be difficult where there is suspicion and fear, where there are ideological differences, where there is religious bigotry, where reason often is blind and takes to flight. But where reason does not exist, hatred and tension will fill the vacuum. The objective must, however, be to bring the sides together by peaceful means. Confidence must first be established through dialog. Areas of common interest must be found and used.\n248.\tThere are many such problem areas of the world which are the cause of heightened international tension: for example, the two Koreas and Cyprus. Cannot both Koreas be admitted to membership of the United Nations without prejudice to the principle of reunification, in the light of a precedent already established? I am sure that members of the Security Council could see the wisdom of such a course of action. If we can eliminate the cause we may be able to effect the cure. Can we not persist and continue the serious efforts to find solutions to these problems by peaceful means? The challenge and responsibility are\n249.\tI am not, nor is my country, naive enough to believe that achieving peace for all mankind is easy. But we believer that if there is a real desire and will for peace on the part of all, with the passage of time, the world may become a saner and happier one in which to live.\n250.\tAt this stage 1 should like to join in the tributes and respects paid to the memory of the late Anwar El Sadat. We live in the Caribbean, very far away from the area in which he lived, worked and died. But those of us who have followed developments in that part of the world could not help but admire the boldness and dynamism of the man himself in trying to break through and overcome a situation which seemed to him static. He was a man who was bold enough to go into an area and to beard the lion in his own den, at the risk, perhaps, of his own safety. In our view, that man was genuinely in search of peace: he was prepared to risk his own safety and his own country's identity in the cause of peace. I, like others, hope that the dialog which he established can be pursued and that all people, wherever they live, will realize that world problems are best resolved through the art of diplomacy and at the conference table, for the suffering and the sacrifice that must otherwise be endured are too heavy a price to pay.\n251.\tIn conclusion, it is therefore my hope that in the President's term of office a momentum will be generated that will permit many of the serious issues which now perplex and threaten the world to be resolved, and that he will get the fullest support of all in this world body so that the silent hopes and expectations of all mankind may be realized. Let us all, in the Assembly, light a candle of hope which will never be extinguished.\n"

        "file_text": "38 I am very grateful for the opportunity to address the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. May I be allowed, first of all, to convey to this gathering warm greetings from the President, the Prime Minister and the Government and people of Zimbabwe. The Republic of Zimbabwe further wishes to assure you all, that 15 .months after our own admission to the United Nations we still firmly stand by our pledge and commitment to support the efforts and ideals of this great Organization. We rededicate ourselves to the United Nations ideals of freedom, equality and social justice for all.\n39.\tOn my own behalf and also speaking for the Zimbabwe delegation, may I congratulate you, Sit; and your country on your well-deserved election to the most important position of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The Assembly could not have made a better choice of a successor to the President of the thirty- fifth session, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany. Your predecessor presided over the deliberations of the thirty-fifth session and of the special sessions with skill, dedication and, indeed, distinction. May I congratulate him through you. Your own experience and distinguished career as diplomat and member of the United Nations Secretariat amply qualify you for the difficult task which the Assembly has given you. Let me assure you of my personal wishes and those of the Zimbabwe delegation for a most enjoyable and fruitful term of office.\n40.\tThe thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly has before it an agenda which is as long as it is truly reflective of the current international scene. Even the most optimistic observer of international affairs will readily admit that our world is today characterized and, indeed, threatened by potentially explosive tensions which have in some regions already led to open armed conflicts, thus menacing regional if not international stability, security and peace. Political oppression, flagrant disregard for and violation of the principle of nonintervention and noninterference in the affairs of a sovereign State, territorial expansionism, racism, disrespect for human rights and inequitable distribution of wealth, nationally and regionally, are among the most common generators of these tensions and open conflicts. In other words, the dangers to regional and international stability and security are very much man-made. In our view, the United Nations, which was founded to ensource world peace and security and to protect the rights of the individual and those of the nations and peoples of the world, must stand firmly and without fear of favor behind the principles and ideals of its Cahrter. The United Nations must unequivocally denounce, condemn and reject outright any acts, designs or tendencies, from whatever quarter, which are aimed at compromising the principles and ideals that have always made this international body a truly effective guarantor of human rights and world peace and security.\n\n41.\tMay I now turn to the southern African region, one of the world's danger spots. We from that troubled area are very much concerned that unless the international community, through the United Nations, intervenes quickly and effectively, the rapid breakdown of regional stability now threatening world peace and security may soon get irretrievably out of control. It is our sincere hope, therefore, that this warning will be taken seriously by the General Assembly and that appropriate measures will be adopted to deal with the situation.\n42.\tAlmost all the causes of the tension and open armed conflicts already mentioned are at work in southern Africa and are attributable to the racist apartheid Pretoria regime. Not only does this regime employ the most repressive police and military machines to silence internal opposition and resistance by the politically oppressed and economically and culturally exploited black majority, but the white racist minority Government also, without any provocation, repeatedly invades the neighboring sovereign States. Thus, unashamedly, the regime's forces have invaded and continue to attack the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of Botswana, the People's Republic of Mozambique and the Republic of Zambia. Again, without any provocation, the racist Pretoria regime has declared its intention to attack our young republic and is currently doing everything in its power to destabilize it.\n43.\tBy far the most dangerous crime in the racist regime's endless catalog of brutalities against humanity is the recent unprovoked invasion of Angola. As representatives know, the invasion was followed by the occupation of the southern part of Angola by the enemy forces, which killed thousands of civilians and senselessly destroyed much Angolan property. The world was stunned and revolted by the regime's disregard of international law. And yet, it must also be sadly observed that Pretoria was not without advocates, if not supporters, in its acts of brutality against the peace-loving people of Angola. As representatives will recall s when in August last the Security Council met to discuss apartheid South Africa's aggression against Angola, certain voices would not support the relevant draft resolution. Those voices wanted the invasion to be seen within a context other than that of an unprovoked aggression against another State resulting , in the violation of that State's territorial integrity and national sovereignty.\n44.\tIn addition to its attacks against the neighboring States with its well-equipped air force, it is also a well known fact that the Pretoria regime finances, equips and trains dissident and unpatriotic Angolan, Mozambican, Zambian and Zimbabwean criminal elements which are regularly unleashed to return to their respective countries to commit sabotage, rape and murder against their own people. Nor is this list of the racist regime's crimes complete. The activities of the murder and kidnapping squads of the apartheid PretoriaGovernment are well known in the capitals of neighboring Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, where hundreds of Namibian and exiled South African patriots have been cold-bloodedly murdered. Many more have been and are being kidnapped and abducted to apartheid South Africa to be tortured to death in the regime's death chambers, euphemistically called prisons.\n45.\tThe international community has now given the racist minority regime more than enough warning and opportunity to end its crimes against the black majority in South Africa and Namibia in particular and humanity in general. And yet, racist Pretoria continues arrogantly to defy with impunity the already very numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. It has disregarded, again with impunity, an equally large number of calls and resolutions of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the nonaligned movement to end its illegal occupation of Namibia and to facilitate genuine political changes internally in order that the black people of South Africa may exercise their full rights as free citizens of their land.\n46.\tWe have already expressed grave concern and warning about the dangerous military consequences for our region caused by the regime's destabilizing policies and activities. We must also emphasize and warn against the equally injurious effects of the apartheid system upon national as well as regional economic developments. For instance, it is not a secret that, taking advantage of the fact that the economies of the neighboring States are linked to it by geographical and historical factors, apartheid South Africa often adopts a policy of economic intimidation and blackmail. Pretoria's economic bullying and its military aggression against the front-line States are aimed at deterring us from giving material, moral and diplomatic support and Assistance to the oppressed South Africans and Namibians and their respective authentic liberation movements.\n47.\tThe Republic of Zimbabwe joins its free and independent neighbors in the region in telling racist South Africa unequivocally that intimidation, whether military or economic, will never deter us from our progressive and internationalist duty and responsibility to give whatever assistance we can to the forces fighting for social justice, political independence and sovereignty in our own region or for that matter anywhere else in the world.\n48.\tThose of us living in the troubled region also know full well that economic independence is crucial not only to our ability effectively to support the processes of liberation in South Africa and Namibia, but also to the maintenance of our own respective hard-won national independence and sovereignty. Consequently, not only do we, as the concerned nations, promote diplomatic relations among ourselves and with other regions, but we are also taking practical measures to develop our respective national and regional economies. Our countries are cooperating amongst themselves economically and are also encouraging cooperation with other regions. The formation of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference in early 1980 clearly demonstrates that determination to develop our economies through regional and interregional cooperation and also effectively to resist the racist regime's economic blackmail.\n49.\tThose honest efforts can succeed only if there is an effective mobilization of our national and regional resources, as well as generous assistance from the developed countries which are Members of this international body. I should like, in that context, to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to those countries, organizations and institutions which have already responded so generously to our .appeal for financial, technical and material aid and assistance. Indeed, the remarkable success of the Zimbabwe Conference on Reconstruction and Development in March this year was largely attributable to a positive international response to our needs. \n5U. l should now like to turn to other areas where foreign aggression, occupation and domination continue to deny the indigenous societies their sovereignty, with serious consequences for regional stability and international security.\n51.\tOn our own continent, for instance, the Sahraoui people of Western Sahara are still denied their right to self-determination by a foreign Power claiming their Territory. The Sahraoui, under the leadership of the gallant and revolutionary POLISARIO5 movement, have for many years been fighting for their country's liberation. Zimbabwe stands solidly behind them because their cause is just and in conformity with the principles of the United Nations, the OAU and the nonaligned movement.\n52.\tThe delegation of Zimbabwe also wishes to see the United Nations and the OAU take the necessary measures to implement their respective decisions and resolutions to bring about a ceasefire in the area. Zimbabwe wishes to see the people of Western Sahara establish their republic on their own territory. We believe that the referendum mentioned in the resolution on Western Sahara, adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [see A/36/534, annex II, resolution AHG/Res.103 (XVIII)], is a step in the right direction.\n53.\tMy delegation is equally concerned about the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Middle East. As representatives know, for decades the United Nations, the OAU and the nonaligned movement have been warning against the dangerous situation developing in that region.\n54.\tAs in southern Africa, in the Middle East too the rapid deterioration is mainly attributable to one factor, in this case Zionism. Indeed, as political and social doctrines, Zionism and apartheid share several common characteristics; hence the existence of what has been called a Tel AvivPretoria axis. They are both racist philosophies whose followers believe that certain races are inferior. Both doctrines justify and encourage the territorial occupation, dispossession and colonization of the so-called racial inferiors.\n55.\tIn the Middle East Zionist expansionist policies and practices have resulted in the grabbing of Arab land and are seriously threatening the very existence of some Arab States and communities. The main cause of tension in that region is Zionist Israel's refusal to accept the universally recognized fact that the Palestinians are a people which, like every other people, is entitled to its own freedom and an independent and sovereign State. Naturally, the dispossessed and oppressed Palestinians and their gallant revolutionary movement, the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], are fighting with all the means at their disposal to wrench their fatherland, including historic Jerusalem, from the Zionists. Again Zimbabwe fully supports the just and legitimate Palestinian struggle for survival, liberation, independence and sovereignty that is being waged in that area.\n56.\tWe also wish to call upon the United Nations urgently to take appropriate steps to compel Israel unconditionally to withdraw from all Palestinian and other Arab lands occupied during the 1967 expansionist war, including the city of Jerusalem, in order to facilitate Palestinian self-determination. In the meantime, the international community, collectively and severally, must continue its political; diplomatic, material and military support for the struggling Palestinians under their gallant liberation movement, the PLO.\n57.\tThe delegation of Zimbabwe holds the view that the Arab States which are resolutely and determinedly supporting the Palestinian struggle, in spite of Israeli aggression against them, must be commended for that internationalist duty. They should also be assisted by the international community in the defense of their sovereignty and territorial integrity against Zionist aggression which is designed to deter them from supporting the PLO and from giving asylum to Palestinian refugees.\n58.\tThe United Nations is the only hope left to all the peoples still living under foreign occupation and oppression for their freedom, self-determination, peace and the fulfillment of their national aspirations. Accordingly, my delegation very strongly supports the people of East Timor in their efforts to enlist United Nations assistance in their struggle for self-determination. We call upon all freedom-loving people to support the FRETILIN6 liberation movement, which is guiding the East Timorese in their struggle for freedom.\n59.\tWe also note with joy that, after decades of colonial rule, the people of Vanuatu have now gained freedom and independence. It pleases us even more to see them occupy the seat, which has always been theirs by right, in this assembly of sovereign nations as the one hundred fifty-fifth Member State of the United Nations. To them we extend our warmest congratulations.\n60.\tBy the same token, we also wish to salute Belize, which attained nationhood on 21 September this year, and we are extremely pleased to see the Belizean delegation occupying its seat in the Assembly.\n61.\tOne of the most sacred principles of the United Nations is that of nonintervention and noninterference in the internal affairs of sovereign State. Regrettably, however, this fundamental pillar of relationships among nations has been, and continues to be, transgressed in several areas, including Afghanistan, Kampuchea and the Korean peninsula, to mention only some of the areas where such violation is taking place. As representatives know, in all these cases, external interference not only makes murky waters even muddier but also certainly endangers world peace and security. Zimbabwe strongly believes that it is the right of every sovereign nation to settle its internal affairs without outside intervention and interference. Accordingly, Zimbabwe supports the call for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed on Afghan and Kampuchean territory. We also appeal for the strict observance of, and respect for, the territorial integrity, sovereignty and nonaligned status of both Afghanistan and Kampuchea.\n62.\tOn the Korean peninsula, external intervention and interference have taken the following main forms: a massive foreign military buildup in the South and foreign propaganda geared towards the throttling of any positive move towards the reunification of Korea. The enemies of Korean unity would like, for instance, to perpetuate disunity among the people of the peninsula by preaching the divisive myth of the so-calledF two Koreas policy. The United Nations must reject outright any designs to create two Koreas and the international community should, instead, support those patriotic forces in Korea labouring to bring about the reunification of Korea under one national government. We believe that the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from the South and the cessation of malicious propaganda will greatly contribute towards the creation of an atmosphere conducive to this goal.\n63.\tZimbabwe also fully supports the initiatives of President Kim II Sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and his Government. Ws believe that the establishment of a confederate system as envisioned by President Kim II Sung is a most realistic step towards the ultimate unification of Korea.\n64.\tI should like now to turn to the economic factors which are some of the main causes of tension on the international scene. Many speakers before me have already referred to the deteriorating world economic situation. Some have warned against its national and regional consequences, which are bound to have serious repercussions on world stability. It has been observed that every country, developing and industrialized, has been experiencing a low level of economic performance, stagnation in industrial output, inflation and increasing unemployment. The ravages of the adverse world economic situation have been more severe in the economies and societies of the developing countries than in those of the industrialized nations.\n65.\tWhat is more disturbing is the fact that the immediate future is not promising for the developing economies and societies, which are certain to experience a further decline in the coming years. The only hope, in our opinion, lies in in international approach to what is certainly a worldwide crisis. While no one would blame the economic woes of the developing countries entirely upon the economic policies and practices of the major industrialized nations, most observers would agree that leading industrialized countries have so far been responsible for retarding progress towards the achievement of international cooperation in dealing with the declining world economic situation. For instance, it is the total lack of political will, coupled with stubbornness, in some quarters, on the part of these nations that has been the chief stumbling block to the launching of global negotiations for the creation of a new international economic order.\n66.\tThe delegation of Zimbabwe wishes to pledge its full support for, and cooperation with, any efforts to bring about intemationaTcooperation in dealing with the serious world economic situation. Although we do not believe that there is any panacea for the current economic woes of the South, we are convinced that NorthSouth cooperation will contribute markedly to averting the catastrophe facing our world today.\n67.\tBy far the biggest threat to international peace and security, and to the very existence of human life on this planet, is the vicious arms race between the two superPowers. This race, which began just after the Second World War, is being fueled by growing EastWest tension, as each superPower seeks to gain mastery over the whole world and to ensure its security against the other by the massive production of arms, including nuclear weapons. United Nations efforts and calls to stop the further spread of military nuclear technology have been  and continue to be ignored, and the list of countries possessing this dangerous technology has become even longer. Also, since 1963, when the Soviet Union, the United States of America and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, many tests have been carried out by those same countries. Even more disturbing, other countries, including apartheid South Africa and Zionist Israel, are known to have added their names to the list. It would appear that some countries regard every region of the world as available for their nuclear testing activities. The calls by the United Nations, the OAU and the nonaligned movement to create nuclear-free zones in such regions as Africa, the Indian Ocean, the Middle East and SouthEast Asia have been ignored contemptuously.\n68.\tThe search for an international agreement to reduce arms, and ultimately to bring about general and complete disarmament, must be continued vigorously. My delegation is most appreciative of United Nations efforts in this regard. We also support the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament and we believe, too, that a world conference devoted to this issue is in the interest of world peace and security.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is with deep emotion that I come to this rostrum on the eve of the funeral ceremonies at which the fraternal Egyptian people and the whole world will mourn President Anwar El Sadat. May the peace of the Almighty be with him. We feel his death as a great loss, not only for Egypt, which loses one of its greatest sons, but also for mankind. We must condemn the ignoble deed which cost him his life and wounded many members of the diplomatic corps. I wish to ask the delegation of Egypt to be good enough to transmit to the family of the deceased\nand to the. Government of Egypt the sincere condolences of the Government and people of the Comoros. .\n170.\tI wish to congratulate Mr. Kittani on his election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His qualities as a diplomat and the distinction with which he represents his country in the Organization are guarantees for the success of our work, '.\n171.\tMay I also be permitted to acknowledge the competence with which his predecessor, Mr. vou Wecimuu; fulfilled the mission we entrusted to him.\n172.\tI should also like to extend a welcome to Vanuatu and Belize, which have now joined the ranks of the great family of nations. I wish to assure them of the readiness of my Government to co-operate with them.\n173.\tOn behalf of my delegation I should also like to express the admiration and respect which we have in the Comoros for the Secretary-General and the tireless efforts he is making in the service of peace throughout the world. In view of the tribulations and multiple dangers threatening mankind, the delicacy and difficulty inherent in the tasks with which we have entrusted him are more clearly seen.\n174.\tPerhaps never before have the peoples and States which we govern felt so strongly the threat which dally weighs upon them and which may at any moment imperil their very existence. Hence, it is urgent to adopt measures to express in terras of action the principles of law and justice which ate written into the Charter of the United Nations.\n175.\tMillions upon millions of human beings are placing their hopes in the Organization. That is an enormous responsibility, but it is not too great for our nations. Throughout the whole of its existence the United Nations has stood for justice and peace, and this Is not the least of its merits. Millions of men, yesterday reduced to exploitation and colonialism, are today upright, proud and determined to be recognized for what they are, namely, human beings. However, in order that the community of States may continue to be credible, a new structure based on mutual understanding must be given to International relations. We must demonstrate that the confidence that our peoples repose in it is not misplaced. We must prove, if only to ourselves, that we aw capable of showing that we are equal to our great responsibilities and that we can fulfill them.\n176.\tThirty-one Members of the Organization, including my country, are suffering particularly acutely from the unfavorable economic situation which the world is experiencing at present, and therefore every day the circle of poverty, famine and disease closes in a little more on their peoples. Those countries, which we have decided to call the \\\"least-developed\\\", are faced with the most awesome structural problems, in terms of human as well as technical and financial resources, and are suffering from one or several geographic or climatic handicaps, such as the absence of a coastline, insularity, drought, cyclones, and so on. Thus each one of them lives with these difficulties in its own way in accordance with its specific con figuration.\n177.'\tSuch is the case with the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, my country, which, because of its insularity, is seriously handicapped by the absence of a solid Infrastructure in the air and maritime transport sectors and that of telecommunications. The development of those infrastructures, like the extension of the road network, Is among the priorities of my Government. But launching that program requires considerable assistance with financial resources, which at present we lack. An ambitious program aimed notably at connecting the principal economic centers of my country to the agricultural regions has been launched, however, thanks in particular to the assistance of the Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian Bind.\n178.\tYet such actions must be extended to all the other vital sectors of our economy, and this will be possible only through co-ordinated international action and with substantial technical and financial support, in particular from the developed countries, the organizations of the United Nations system and other developing countries that are in a position to provide U.\n179.\tWe can therefore only be pleased at the growing interest that the Organization is showing in this category of countries and, thus, at the initiative of the French Government in hosting in Paris last month the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.\n180.\tOne of the merits of that Conference is that it has made it possible for us to take stock of our problems, to determine the priorities involved and to define a strategy for each one of our countries with considerable realism. Unfortunately, we must deplore the lack of readiness displayed at that Conference by certain developed countries to participate in a substantial way in the development of these poorest countries. It is those negative attitudes which underlie the impasse which the North-South dialog has reached and which, in our opinion, are particularly dangerous because they can promote and multiply confrontations.\n181.\tTo be sure, we in the third world also have a not Insignificant role In the success of the North-South dialog. We cannot overcome underdevelopment by continuing to devote a large part of cur meager resources to armaments, which are all the more harmful in that they increase our dependence on the suppliers. '\n182.\tThe greet Powers must at last demonstrate moderation and realism and in particular stop giving the impression that their fundamental interests are constantly being threatened. Otherwise, a new form of cold war will emerge, giving priority to problems of security and defense to the detriment of the goals of co-operation and development contemplated for the new international economic order that we wish to establish.\n183.\tThe International Meeting on Co-operation and Development dial is to take place at the end of this month at Cancun will give the principal Powers an exceptional opportunity to regain the confidence of the third world by showing that they will not go back to negative unilateral attitudes on the relevance of the North-South dialog. We hope that this meeting will result in a clear commitment to contribute to the launching of global negotiations and that a basic consensus can be reached.\n184.\tWe are bound to observe that It Is the rivalry between the great Powers that underlies the unacceptable situation that continues to prevail in Afghanistan. We continue to feel that that country must regain its status as an independent and non-aligned State and that therefore the presence of foreign troops on its territory is illegal. Such crises not only threaten international peace and security but can have unforeseeable consequences.\n185.\tThe unfortunate conflict which, broke out more than a year ago between Iran and Iraq, on the subject of which we have on numerous occasions expressed our great concern, does not simply constitute a threat to peace in the region. The repercussions of that confrontation on the sale and price of a product of fundamental importance show to what extent the general well-being may be endangered by any disturbance or crisis of significant magnitude. 1\n186.\tIt is also the rivalry between the great Powers that underlies the explosive situation that today characterizes the region of the Indian Ocean and threatens to transform that area into an arena of permanent instability. In this connection we can only regret that because of the numerous obstacles produced by certain developed countries, the conference that the Organization expected to hold at Colombo this year to study the modalities for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)] cannot take place.\t'\n187.\tThe industrialized world cannot invoke the great values of democracy, freedom and respect for human rights while at the same time trying to defend at all cost the most exorbitant elements of its interests and its most intolerable privileges, especially when we know that it is with the complicity of certain of those countries and the support of their multinational corporations that South Africa today succeeds in maintaining thousands of Africans in a situation of indescribable exploitation. It is thanks to their aid that Pretoria continues to defy with impunity the decisions of the Organization by illegally occupying Namibia while systematically persecuting the representative of its people, SWAPO.\n188.\tWe must also deplore the fact that because of the veto cast by certain permanent members, the Security Council has been unable so far fully to assume, its responsibilities pursuant to the unanimous request of African and non-aligned countries. It was because of that impediment and the general Impasse that faced the Organization that a special session of the General Assembly devoted to this important question was held right here last month. On that occasion, as every time that this problem has been debated, by the international community, there was unanimous agreement that severe measures should be token to force South Africa to comply with our decisions.\n189.\tUnfortunately, it seems that neither our unanimous support for the struggle of the Namibian people nor successive condemnations have been sufficient. Only concerted and collective international action is likely to lead Pretoria to observe even its own commitments. For such action, my delegation believes Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must constitute our base of reference. We must now attempting to re-examine it under the pretext of attempting to improve it. For any hesitation  in its implementation will only serve to strengthen South Africa's intransigence.\n190.\tTho great Powers must agree to severe sanctions being imposed upon the apartheid regime and must change their complacent attitude with respect to it, just as they must stop supporting Israel by providing it with the means for its annexationist and expansionist policy. '\n191.\tThe attack upon the Iraqi installation at Himuz, which my country severely condemned at the time, clearly shows Israel's deliberate will to continue to resort to force, in violation of the Charter. The means put at its disposal make it possible for the Zionist forces to extend their grip by occupying Palestinian land, by shamelessly Judaizing the occupied territories and by high-handedly taking over Jerusalem, the Holy City, the sacred center of all revealed religions.\n192.\tIsrael can no longer continue to ignore the Palestinian fact, the right of that people to self-determination and to found an independent State upon its own soil. I wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm once again the steadfast support of the Government of the Comoros for the just cause of the Palestinian people and for their sole representative, the PLO.\n193.\tIn the case of Kampuchea, the Organization has called for the urgent and immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops based in that territory so that the people of Kampuchea may choose their Government through democratic process.\n194.\tWith regard to the situation in Western Sahara, we have noted with satisfaction the position adopted by His Majesty the King of Morocco, Hassan II, at the recent session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity held at Nairobi, whereby he agreed to the organization of a referendum in that Territory. We hope Uiat this new situation, as well as the atmosphere of frankness that prevailed during the recent meeting at Nairobi of the QAU Implementation Committee entrusted with following up this question, will make possible an early solution satisfactory to all the parties concerned in this tragic problem.\n195.\t' Before concluding this rapid examination of the international situation, I should like to refer once again to a question with which the Assembly is fully familiar and which, as far as we Comorians are concerned, remains a subject of constant concern: the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte.\n1%. As everyone knows, this problem arose upon the accession of the Comoros to Independence. I shall not go into the historical background of this question here, since a specific debate will be devoted to it during the present session. For the time being 1 shall merely recall that each time this question has been debated by the international community there has been unanimity in affirming that Mayotte is an integral part of the Comoros and that, as such, it should be reintegrated into the Comorian entity.\n197. Africa, supported in this respect by the General Assembly, the non-aligned movement, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and all peoples that cherish peace and justice, is increasing its endeavors to achieve this\nend, An ad hoc committee especially instructed to follow the development of this question has. been created by the OAU, It is to meet this year in the Comoros during the month of .November in order to take stock of the situation.\n198.\tOn 5 October of this year, during an official visit to Paris, the President of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, considered this matter with the President of France, Mr. Francois Mitterand. In particular, the President of the Comoros expressed the hope that the negotiations with regard to this question that had been begun with the previous Government of France would be continued.\n199.\tThe understanding attitude of the President of the French Republic and his readiness to do everything possible to break the existing deadlock, and the-French Socialist Party's constant denunciation of the attempts made by certain colonialist factions to separate Mayotte from the Comorian entity, have led us to hope that a satisfactory solution in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the Organization can quickly be found to this unfortunate problem.\n200.\tIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope that the United Nations will fulfill its primary purpose and continue to provide a forum for an enlightened exchange of views on international questions. If we wish to have a new world in which peace, security and prosperity are assured to all, we must understand that this will not happen by itself. The Islamic Federal Republic of Comoros will continue to contribute, within the limits of its modest means, to the achievement of the noble goals written into the Charter\n"

        "file_text": " At the outset, Sir, allow me to join preceding speakers in offering you the sincere congratulations of my delegation on your election to preside over this thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your recognized skill and experience in the field of multilateral diplomacy are indeed important assets at a time when the Organization is called upon to deal with an ever-growing number of complex issues of global concern. We wish you every success in the performance of your important task.\n92.\tWe also wish to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, who carried out with great skill the functions of the presidency during our previous session.\n93.\tWe also include in our tribute the SecretaryGeneral for his relentless efforts in promoting international peace and security.\n94.\tWe most warmly welcome the two new members of the family of nations, Vanuatu and Belize. We are convinced that they will make an effective contribution towards the realization of the goals of the Organization.\n95.\tThe Republic of Suriname had the privilege of becoming part of the Organization when we gained independence in 1975. In the six years that have elapsed, Suriname has taken its place in the international community, and we have learned to deal with problems at the sub regional, regional and international levels.\n96.\tOur internal situation has drastically changed since February 1980, when the traditional form of government was replaced by a revolutionary leadership in which the army plays a vanguard role with the full support of the civilian sector of society. The Government has set up a vigorous program for the fundamental restructuring of our society in the political, economic and social spheres and in the educational system. Time does not permit me to elaborate fully on the programs that we have designed so far. However, in this context, I should like to elaborate on the national goals and objectives with regard to our economic situation.\n97.\tWe are taking steps to ensure that our economy becomes organized in such a way as to achieve not only economic growth but the genuine development of our people. Notwithstanding the steady growth of our economy in the past decades, we are aware of the fact that the level of production by our people is still unsatisfactory and that the distribution of wealth shows a serious lack of balance.\n98.\tEconomic growth, in our opinion, is not a substitute for development; it is not a substitute for a transfer of knowhow at the technical, managerial and marketing levels. Self-reliance is considered paramount to us in any future development of our economy and our people. We therefore intend to develop those sectors of our economy that arc based upon our natural and human resources, striving for diversification and control of those sectors. We are in the process of developing programs for the expansion of our industrial potential in mining, forestry, fishery and agriculture.\n99.\tOur foreign policy is directly linked to the objectives just mentioned. Furthermore, we continue to attach great value to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the Organization, in which we firmly believe. Our adherence to the authentic principles of nonalignment constitutes another important element on which our foreign policy is based.\n100.\tThe General Assembly convenes its thirty-sixth session as the world shows fearsome signs of increasing political tension and continuing economic stagnation. Undoubtedly, those developments will place a heavy strain on the ability of the United Nations to fulfill its role in the maintenance of peace and.security in the world. That task has never been an easy one. We, the Members of this Organization, take pride in its success during the past decades in preventing the escalation of many local and regional conflicts into a conflict of global proportions. The years ahead of us, however, might bring less heartening results, as the causes that continue to threaten peace and .security still persist, and our efforts towards their eradication have until now proven less than successful.\n101.\tThe maintenance of peace and security will become increasingly difficult for the Organization in a world in which the existing unjust economic order continues to keep the vast majority of mankind in a chronic state of underdevelopment, hunger and deprivation. In the past year the developing world has become painfully aware of the fact that the prospects for restructuring that unfair system are gloomy.\n102.\tThe major industrialized countries have chosen to remain indifferent and selfish towards the just cause of the developing countries for a more equitable international economic order. The continuing presence of foreign troops in independent States poses a serious menace to peace, and the Assembly has to deal with it. The denial of self-determination to peoples in southern Africa and the Middle East will remain a source of tension and an obstacle to global peace and stability.\n103.\tA most alarming development in the past year has been the further deterioration in the relations between the superPowers. Strain in the relations between the two countries, already imminent at our previous session, has been seriously aggravated and has contributed substantially to the escalation of tension, conflicts and uncertainty in several regions of the world.\n104.\tAs a country aware of its location in the Caribbean and Latin American region, my Government is particularly interested in developments in this area. To break through the isolation from the sister countries of our region imposed upon us by our colonial past has been a constant policy of my country, and more so since the revolution ignited on 25 February 1980. It will remain a priority in our foreign policy to continue this process and to establish and maintain friendly relations with all the countries of our region, regardless of their political or social economic systems.\n105.\tWe deeply appreciate the hands of friendship extended to us by our sister Latin American and Caribbean nations, and we have initiated the course of fruitful cooperation. In pursuing this policy my Government will remain faithful to the principles of nonintervention and noninterference in the internal affairs of States, as we remain convinced that strict adherence to these principles offers a primordial guarantee against interState conflicts and creates a climate for fruitful cooperation among States.\n106.\tMy Government wishes to express its concern at the danger of becoming another testing ground for the superPower rivalry that looms over the Caribbean and Latin America. The legitimate struggle of peoples to free themselves from obsolete oppressive social structures and economic exploitation must be recognized and respected, and it would be a mistake to ignore this natural course of history.\n107.\tWhile we deplore the continued violence and loss of life in the sister Republic of El Salvador, my Government holds the view that the people of El Salvador will achieve a political solution to their internal problems if external presence and interference are eliminated. In this connection, my Government reaffirms the position on this question taken by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries of the Caribbean Community [CARICOM] in June of this year.\n108.\tWith regard to the Middle East, my Government notes with concern that this volatile region has been further plummeted into a situation which can easily escalate into a full-scale war with global consequences. It is my Government's view that Israel's behavior during the past months has significantly contributed to creating this highly explosive situation. Israel, stubbornly refusing to comply with the decisions of the United Nations calling upon it to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, has stepped up its violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its Arab neighbors. My Government wishes to take this opportunity to repeat its condemnation of the indiscriminate air raids by Israel on Lebanon and the Republic of Iraq.\n109.\tA comprehensive peace settlement remains, in the final analysis, the best guarantee of peace for all States in the region, including Israel. It is now a generally accepted fact that such a settlement must entail the rendering of justice to the Palestinian people, that is to say, the exercise of their right to self-determination, including the right to establish their c independent and sovereign State.\n110.\tMy Government is convinced that any peace effort designed to circumvent this reality is doomed to fail and that anything short of the full participation of the Palestinian people in the peace process, through its legitimate representative, the PLO, will share the same fate.\n111.\tMy Government deplores the ongoing war between the two nonaligned countries of Iran and Iraq. Is is indeed regrettable that the parties to the conflict have not seized on the peace initiatives of the nonaligned movement and the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations to end their hostilities. We once more urge the two countries to work towards a peaceful settlement of their dispute.\n112. We cannot but note our strong disappointment at the non-implementation of the decisions of the General Assembly calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of Afghanistan. While we reject any form of intervention in the internal affairs of States, it is obvious that the direct involvement of superPowers in these unlawful acts bears serious implications for international peace and security. Our support for a political settlement of this issue on the basis of General Assembly resolution 35/37 remains unchanged.\n113. A commendable effort of the Organization during the past year has been the convening of the International Conference on Kampuchea. As an observer to that Conference, my Government welcomes its results embodied in the Declaration on Kampuchea, which, in our view, offers a viable basis for further negotiations to end the occupation of that country and to establish a durable peace in SouthEast Asia. We therefore urge all the countries of that region to cooperate with the United Nations in this effort.\n114. The situation on the Korean peninsula remains at a stalemate. On the occasion of the ninth anniversary of the Joint Communique of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we call upon both parties to make all possible efforts to promote reconciliation between the South and the North through dialog in order to achieve the peaceful unification of their divided homeland.\n115. The high hopes that prevailed at our previous session for the speedy independence of Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) did not materialize owing to the contempt that the South African racist regime has consistently shown for the decisions of this Organization. Over the past 15 years the international community has pursued all peaceful means in order to end the illegal occupation of Namibia. After the frustration that it encountered for many years in dealing with this question, our Organization is fully justified in taking the strongest possible measures to ensure the genuine independence of Namibia.\n116. The overwhelming majority of States, by approving the application of the measures envisaged in Chapter VII of the Charter of the Organization at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, clearly expressed the indignation of the international community at the peace-menacing behavior of the South African regime. It is therefore the duty of all members of the international community to put decisive pressure on South Africa to withdraw its illegal administration from the Territory of Namibia.\n117. My Government takes this opportunity to restate its condemnation of the violation of the territorial integrity of Angola by South African colonialist forces and to reaffirm its solidarity with the Angolan people. The people of Suriname look upon the people of Angola with admiration for the relentless support they give to SWAPO and to the oppressed people of Namibia in their struggle against the Pretoria racist people.\n118.\tIn South Africa itself the crime of apartheid is un-diminishingly practiced against the majority of its population. The black majority population of South Africa deserves the full support of the international community in its struggle to dismantle this universally condemned system and to regain its human dignity.\n119.\tRecognizing the danger for mankind resulting from the arms race, the General Assembly, at its tenth special session, devoted to disarmament and held in 1978, adopted the Final Document of that session by consensus [resolution S1012]. The determination reflected in its program of Action to reverse the madness of the arms race gave rise to the hope that mankind had finally come to terms with this grave problem. This hope, unfortunately, has been proved illusory. The arms race has continued unrestrained, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\n120.\tAdmittedly, some limited progress has been made in certain areas, but this falls short of the least that could be expected from the mandate of that session. It is beyond doubt that the world has moved closer to the danger of self-annihilation since the tenth special session.\n121.\tOf course, we perfectly understand that disarmament is not a simple matter, as it encompasses the security of States and their very survival. But to resign ourselves to the notion that the only way to preserve peace is through a continuing arms buildup would indeed mean suicide for humanity, as it appears to us that the ability of mankind to live indefinitely in this perilous situation is not unlimited.\n122.\tThe goal of disarmament ought to remain the concern of all nations of the world, since the survival of all men is at stake. We cannot but stress the special responsibility of those States possessing the means to bring death and total destruction not only upon themselves but Upon other nations as well. The only way to avert this danger is through meaningful negotiations leading to restraint of the arms buildup and, ultimately, disarmament under effective international control. We therefore regret recent decisions to add new types of destructive weapons to the existing arsenal. It is the opinion of my Government that this step is bound further to complicate future disarmament negotiations, already complex by their very nature.\n123.\tDespite the disappointing results of the past, it is incumbent upon us to sustain our efforts to achieve disarmament in view of the danger inherent in the unrestrained arms race, not to mention the economic benefits that can result from, the reallocation of arms expenditures for development purposes. My Government considers that the second special session of the Assembly on disarmament, to be held next year, is yet another opportunity for mankind to confront this danger seriously.\n124.\tThe international economic outlook, especially for the developing countries, is very dim. The world economy today is in its second major recession since 1973, which has resulted in high unemployment and inflation rates and balance of payment deficits, and has consequently motivated the industrialized countries to resort to protectionist policies in order to safeguard their own interests.\n125.\tThe developing countries are not in a position to escape from the heavy burden imposed on them because of the present unjust international economic order, which mainly favors \u2022 the interests of the industrialized countries. The .developing countries have to bear the full weight of the impact of the energy crisis and pay proportionally more for industrial goods, and in doing so they are importing the inflation of the industrialized countries. The extremely high interest rates on capital make it nearly impossible to obtain sufficient financial resources to enable the majority of the developing countries to make the most crucial adjustments in their economies.\n126.\tDuring the past years we have seen a proliferation of protectionist measures consisting of tariff and non-tariff barriers, which are being adopted by the industrialized countries against imports of goods from the developing countries. Unfortunately, these measures are taking place at a time when the developing countries are in need of the foreign exchange generated by those exports. As a consequence, this policy has resulted in serious constraints on their development efforts and has led to further deterioration in the terms of trade of the developing countries, causing tremendous problems such as a decline, in internal savings, increasing unemployment and serious social unrest, a greater burden of debt servicing and greater dependence on external savings.\n127.\tThe impact of today's world economic crisis has seriously affected the developing countries and has acquired new and more frightening aspects. Their impoverished economies can no longer defend themselves against rising economic burdens and find themselves on the verge of collapse.\n128.\tSome time ago, we solemnly and unanimously adopted the principles which would govern future economic relations among nations in a Declaration and program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [General Assembly resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)]. It is regrettable to note that to date we have not been able to take the necessary action to establish such an order, owing to a lack of political will, considerations of short-term interests and fear of jeopardizing the present heights of achievement and influence of the industrialized countries. These countries seem to be very much preoccupied with themselves, safeguarding and maintaining their high level of living standards gained from the present inequitable international economic order. Only occasionally have they paid attention to the struggle for survival of the peoples in the developing countries who live in misery and who are desperately fighting for their legitimate right to establish a new international economic order which could ultimately enable them to harvest the fruits of their own efforts.\n129.\tA good example of the present stalemate in the relations between the two groups of countries is the proposal to launch a global round of negotiations. Two years ago the international community agreed on the need for a global round of negotiations, and last year at this time the hope was expressed that early this year the \\\"relevant discussions could start. However, during the past months, the parties have not been able to agree on a set of rules of procedure and are not even ready to touch on the more difficult problem of drafting an agenda.\n130.\tOne of the main difficulties related to the proposals for institutional change, especially where this would result in more effective participation by the developing countries, is the management of the international economic system. It was very remarkable to observe how apprehensive the industrialized countries were of discussing their traditional dominant role in the world economy if this would result in a substantial change of the rules of the game governing certain international economic and financial institutions.\n131.\tIt would not be fair to pinpoint only the gloomy side of our economic relations, and I should therefore like to draw the attention of the international community to the forthcoming summit conference of the leaders of 22 developed and developing countries at Cancun. The inspiration for the Cancun meeting came from the sobering report issued last year by the Brandt Commission.4 That report not only warned against the danger of mass starvation in the developing world unless a program for survival was adopted, but also called for a meeting of heads of Government to enable proposals and concessions to be thrashed out with candor and boldness. On the one hand, we realize that the road to Cancun is littered with exhausted rhetoric, broken pledges and failed strategies. But, on the other hand, we must recognize that the world's economic and political crisis is not a temporary one but is deeply rooted in the present international institutions. To give up the dialog would be a wrong strategy, and we therefore strongly welcome the Cancun meeting. We are convinced that from the mistakes and experiences of the past years a new approach can be conceived in order to make a new attempt to revive the stalemated global negotiations.\n132.\tI have touched on some aspects of the relations between the developed and the developing countries. It would, however, be an omission on my part if I did not stress the necessity of more cooperation among the developing countries themselves. In this connection, my Government holds the view that the need to expand the developing countries' exports of primary and processed commodities remains the highest priority for those countries.\n133.\tIn the past two decades, we have witnessed the formation by developing countries of an unprecedented number of economic cooperation and integration groupings, mainly at the regional and subregional levels. The results of these groupings have not always been successful. At the same time, it is important for us to deepen the South South economic linkages with a new sense of urgency. The High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation Among Developing Countries, held at Caracas from 13 to 19 May 1981, was a step in the right direction. We hope that in implementing the various economic cooperation activities adopted, the developing countries can rely on the collaboration of the United Nations regional commissions, the specialized agencies and other intergovernmental organizations.\n134.\tThe Government of Suriname is of the opinion that one of the means of strengthening economic cooperation is the development of adequate transportation and communication systems appropriate to the requirements of the developing countries. The high costs of actual transportation and communication systems have been a major obstacle to increasing trade and cooperation among developing countries.\n135.\tHaving said that, I should like to stress that economic cooperation among developing countries cannot be a substitute for global economic cooperation between developing and developed countries, nor should it in any way relieve the industrial countries of their responsibilities and commitment towards the developing countries.\n136.\tThe Government of Suriname attaches high priority to subregional and regional economic and political cooperation and has therefore embarked on a course of closer cooperation, especially in the subregion of the Caribbean and Central America. The Government of Suriname has already taken the first steps to closer cooperation with CARICOM. Besides the already existing economic cooperation with its neighboring countries, Suriname will very soon embark on fostering closer relations with the Andean countries and the countries of Central America, including Mexico.\n137.\tIt is a well-known fact that the wide and continuing gap between the needs of developing countries and the resources available for operational activities is growing. To date, despite numerous efforts, it has not been possible to ensure a considerable real increase in resources for operational activities on a predictable, continuous and assured basis.\n138.\tAt the same time, we are witnessing the phenomenon that, as a result of various United Nations global conferences, the creation of global funds to be financed through the mechanism of pledging conferences is being encouraged. These funds are related to specific sectoral programs as part of global conferences and are determined in many cases by the consensus achieved during those conferences. Many donor countries support the creation of these funds for such purposes as are consistent with the perceived development assistance priorities of their own Governments.\n139.\tHowever; that approach has resulted in a reduction of the relative share of resources in the field of multilateral technical cooperation handled by UNDP, and in the creation of a number of separate funds, each with its own administrative structures. We question the justification of that approach singe the result of the pledging conferences has, to date, been far below the targets envisaged. It is reasonable to expect that the industrialized countries, after making commitments, would be prepared to accept their share in implementing those decisions which they strongly supported. It is therefore a matter of regret that the present trend in some industrialized countries is to decrease their financial contributions to the different funds of the Organization.\n140.\tWe therefore favor a single purpose funding mechanism for multilateral technical cooperation. This would not only ensure for the developing countries that the resources available are distributed on a predetermined equitable basis but also that the use of such resources would be in accordance with individual national development priorities. For the donor countries, a single general purpose mechanism would ensure that the resources made available for multilateral cooperation are used to the maximum extent possible for coherent and integrated development activities.\n141.\tThe call for a new international economic order reflects the disillusionment with a system that no longer suits our needs. It involves a desire for general systematic reforms, as well as revisions in specific functional areas. The new international economic order and the new law of the sea represent two such efforts the first of a general and the second of a more specific, functional nature.\n142.\tIt is clear that the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will have a great impact on the new international economic order. That Conference was convened because of the realization that those resources must be developed in an orderly manner for the benefit of all and must contribute to a more equitable and workable global economic system.\n143.\tWe therefore fully agree with those who claim that a weak international seabed authority one merely granting concessions and licenses to transnational enterprises would only give rise to a new form of imperialism. It is no secret, therefore, that the third world countries consider the draft seabed mining legislation in the convention on the law of the sea a breakthrough in the global economic stalemate between developed and developing countries. But a chance for stable commodity prices, guaranteed funds for development and the acquisition of sophisticated technology by those developing countries which have economies heavily based on mining of land based minerals might be lost if some industrialized nations attempt to scuttle the convention.\n144.\tWe appeal to all nations of good will to do nothing to destroy the results achieved during eight years of hard work since 1973, when the Conference began its work on the draft convention. The Government of the Republic of Suriname is still convinced that a comprehensive and well-balanced convention is the only way to avoid a scramble for the riches which are the common heritage of mankind, in accordance with the declaration of principles contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV).\n145.\tAt the end of the ninth session of the Conference there were hopeful signs that that slow-moving legal Conference was not far from its completion. A compromise was reached on many outstanding issues, particularly with regard to part XI of the informal draft convention, which regulates the principles governing the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Therefore it was a matter of deep regret for my country that these high expectations were overshadowed at the beginning of the tenth session of that Conference because of a statement by one delegation that it had been instructed to ensure that negotiations should not end at that session, pending a policy review by its Government.\n146.\tMy delegation notes with satisfaction that a genuine spirit of cooperation was demonstrated at the end of the tenth session, which resulted inter alia in the decision that the present informal draft convention should be converted into a revised text which will have a formal status.\n147.\tMy delegation also notes with satisfaction that one of the most persistent problems faced by the Conference over the years, namely, the question of maritime boundary delimitation between adjacent or opposite States, has been solved by the introduction of a new compromise formula, which was acceptable to the group favoring a formula with emphasis on \\\"equitable principles\\\" as well as to the group favoring an equidistance formula. The decisions on the seats of the International SeaBed Authority and the Law of the Sea Tribunal are also considered a major step forward, and I take this opportunity to congratulate Jamaica and the Federal Republic of Germany respectively.\n148.\tThe Government of Suriname sincerely hopes that the process of consultations and negotiations on some outstanding issues will be finalized during the last substantive session in March 1982, so that in early September of that year the signing of the Final Act and the opening of the convention for signature in Caracas will take place in order to fulfill the mandate that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea received from the General Assembly 11 years ago.\n149.\tThe increasing tension in the world in the political, military and social, as well as economic, fields makes it imperative for us to express our great concern. The Government and people of the Republic of Suriname therefore pledge full support for our joint efforts in keeping this planet intact by means of arms-control and peace-making initiatives and in establishing a new international economic order. Strict adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations is therefore, in our opinion, a matter of survival for all nations living on this planet.\n"

        "file_text": "2.\t Mr. President, in the course of the Fifth and Sixth Conferences of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries I had the privilege of many opportunities to appreciate your outstanding qualities as a statesman, of which you gave admirable proof. Your election to preside over the work of the General Assembly is a source of satisfaction to the peoples of the third world and to the international community. On behalf of the people and Government of Panama, and on my own behalf, I am happy to greet you and, through you, all the members of the Assembly.\n3.\tWe also wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar and to express our appreciation of his efforts to start the global negotiations relating to international economic cooperation for development.\n4.\tMay we also greet the recently admitted new Member States, Vanuatu and Belize.\n5.\tMy country appreciates having been elected by a significant majority to one of the vice-presidencies of the Assembly and to have been appointed a member of the Credentials Committee.\n6.\tWe wish, moreover, to express our sincere thanks for the condolences expressed by the majority of Member States on the tragic loss of General Omar Torrijos Herrera, the prime mover and leader of the Panamanian revolutionary process and Head of Government of our country. We appreciate the commemorations field in his honor in so many countries. General Torrijos Will remain forever our major source of inspiration.\n7.\tI have come to this rostrum to speak on behalf of a people that has waged a long struggle for its full independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty. We fully share the great concerns of the international community concerns which are even more serious to those nations that still labor under different forms of economic and political dependence.\n8.\tThe third world, which is identified by the similarity of its problems in the struggle for political, economic and cultural independence, hails 1970 as the year in which the General Assembly, at its twenty-fifth session, adopted the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. Thus the United Nations gave decided support to the concept of collective and universal security, without military alliances, for the establishment of truly stable peace in the world. That was a significant response from the countries that were witnessing the cold war of the great Powers, since it pointed the way to assuring the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations outside the traditional bounds of military pacts and the servitude imposed by the force of arms or by economic pressures.\n9.\tHowever, even today, there still subsist practices of dividing up the world among the great, without concern for the legitimate interests of the weak. We admit frankly that the role of the latter in the solution of world problems usually tends to be that of mere spectators or victims. Yet we can now draw comfort from the growing national and universal trend in Latin America, Africa and Asia. There is a new attitude and a greater determination on the part of the people of the third world to overcome traditional frustrations of international dependency and the deficiencies in the old political patterns.\n10.\tThe distinguished heads of State or Government and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs gathered in the Assembly have focused their attention on the delicate economic and political situation that has become increasingly serious during the last decade and for which no effective solution has yet been devised. The possibility of undertaking and completing adequate global negotiations is still a mirage, and the establishment of a new international economic order, through the implementation of the new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [General Assembly resolution 35/56, annex] is still a frustrated dream.\nA/36/PV.20\n11.\tWe shall speak briefly on those aspects of the crisis that have the worst effects upon countries like mine, which form the majority of Members of the Organization. The upheavals in the economies of the handful of countries that form the industrialized few are shifted to the dependent nations, severely burdening them and forcing them into irremediable collapse. Astronomical foreign debts paralyse the less developed countries and deprive them of their vital resources, causing them to sink into\nunderdevelopment. The technological gap between the industrialized and the less developed countries widens constantly, thwarting the efforts of the latter to increase their holdings in capital goods, raise their productivity and take a more active and useful part in the world market.\nMeanwhile, the two gigantic constellations of destructive power continue to pursue their insane arms race, spending unproductively each year hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars a small fraction of which would be enough to provide hundreds of millions of human beings suffering hunger, ignorance and unemployment with the schools, hospitals, food, medicine and tools they so badly need.\n13.\tEven worse than this terrible physical and spiritual damage is ^he havoc wrought on the conscience of mankind by the threat of nuclear war with which the two superPowers confront each other. Indeed, we are nearly on the threshold of such a war. The peoples of the world feel a sense of dread as they contemplate the possibility of war in which the wave of radioactivity would annihilate hundreds of millions of human beings in a matter of minutes but, ironically, would spare entire cities.\n14.\tThe situation facing the community of nations represented here is but a manifestation of the collapse of the international economic, social and political order that has existed since the Second World War. To overcome this crisis we must build a new international society, one making effective and valid the principles of coexistence and cooperation among States.\n15.\tMy country's international policy is based on the fundamental principles of the nonaligned movement as an independent moral force, independent of blocs and spheres of influence, and as a positive and global' factor of international peace and security. We believe in the right of every people to adopt the political, economic, social and cultural system that best meets the needs of its great national majorities. The pluralistic nature of the movement, which is based upon the sound application of the principle of the sovereign equality of States, rests on the right to self-determination. To the nonaligned, this means that States have equal rights and equal duties, in both the political and economic spheres, and that, despite the differing economic, social or political systems or ways of life they may adopt, they are all equal members of the international community.\n16.\tThe economic and social problems of the third world countries will not be solved by magic or by dogmatic formulas. Redress lies in planned development, which calls for reforms in the traditional structures in order to adapt them to the complex requirements of contemporary life.\n17.\tWe of the smaller nations cannot but be disturbed at the tangible fact that there are still those who would deal with us according to the domino theory. Panama, on the contrary, views relations among all nations of the world within a context of true pluralism in which the right of every people freely to choose its own form of development must be genuine, not illusory.\n18.\tOne of the basic objectives of the Organization is to wage a universal struggle to seek and maintain peace. But\nwe admit as a basic fact the existence of an international and transnational structure that is unjust, violent, oppressive and unequal. This fact, the motive force and crux of which is, on the one hand, the international division and exploitation of labor and, on the other hand, certain regional processes and groupings, has shaped an imbalanced structure of dependence that retards the possibilities for the full, democratic and free development of natural and human resources and gives rise to the social backwardness of peoples. This is an undesirable situation and, besides flouting the principles of the Organization, is a frequent cause of the tensions and conflicts that threaten world peace.\n19.\tHowever, it would be both immoral and collusive to strive for world peace at the cost of international justice. It has been the search for justice that has throughout history legitimized revolutionary movements of social, anti colonialist and anti-imperialist liberation that strove against these and all other forms of international tutelage. The struggle for true social development is a struggle against all forms of oppression, exploitation and political ' or ideological tutelage and its aim is to eradicate dependence and subordination. As far as we are concerned, the struggle against oppression and dependence is the struggle for peace. The best guarantee of peace is one that does away with international injustice.\n20.\tPanama is a nation lying on the isthmus that links two great portions of the American continent and ensures maritime communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. This geographical feature constitutes the country's main natural resource and at the same time offers a useful service to the nations of the world. In the course of Panama's history this resource has been taken over to serve the interests of one or another Power, thus creating distortions in the country's structure when its character as a link led to a disregard of the other national resources, casting the great majority of its population into a marginal existence and setting up a system of economic, political and social injustice. Our people have always struggled to regain the enjoyment of that resource for the benefit of national development, and to secure independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty and a just and truly democratic way of life. These efforts have always been at one with the interests of the international community, since they oppose unilateral control over an inter-oceanic waterway by any one Power to the detriment of other nations.\n21.\tIt was not until the end of the decade of the 1960s that the process of altering the social, political and economic consequences of that situation was begun. The Panamanian revolutionary process, inspired and led by General Omar Torrijos, threw open the doors to a true democratization of Panamanian society and to the full achievement of our independence and sovereignty.\n22.\tAgrarian reform provided access to land for our farmers and all communities were given access to education, housing, health care, communications and sources of energy; this brought all regions of the country into the national body. Participation by all communities throughout the country in the discussions and decisions concerning problems and the future of the Republic was widened through a general system of popular and pluralist representation upon which the legislative power rests.\n23.\tThese transformations allowed the establishment of a healthy climate of social order and institutional and political stability, guaranteeing respect for human rights and civic freedoms and permitting the continued peaceful development of the nation. Yet all this has occurred and has been given meaning within the context of the noble struggle and the persevering efforts over the past 13 years, through difficult and delicate diplomatic negotiations to regain Panamanian territorial integrity and the effective exercise of our genuine sovereignty over the Panama Canal area, a matter to which I shall refer in due course.\n24.\tHowever, domestic peace within our borders cannot be duly consolidated or safeguarded from threats while the neighboring region continues to be afflicted by the painful conflicts besetting it. We are disturbed by the political, social and economic climate that characterizes every region of the world without exception. The key to the solution of the immense problems that overwhelm the large majority of the countries of the third world lies in the fact that true peace is indivisible from social justice. Wherever there is Want, disease, ignorance and unemployment, wherever there is hopelessness, there will be violence in one form or another: the violence of hunger, uncertainty, homelessness, the violence of privileges and the violence of those who uphold them by refusing to make the necessary changes and, finally, the violent rebellion of the wretched and the forgotten who can no longer wait forever for peaceful change.\n25.\tA particular source of deep concern is the profound political and social crisis affecting Central America and the climate of tension that prevails in the Caribbean. The crisis cannot be resolved without going into its deeper causes, and these lie in the dramatic imbalances and social injustices suffered by the majority of the populations of the area.\n26.\tIt is unrealistic to blame these crisis on foreign influences or infiltrations while ignoring the internal causes. Central American conflicts are not imported spin-offs from the EastWest confrontation but are truly Central American in nature and can only be settled by the members of the very societies affected by them. Some have tried to describe the crises as a manifestation of EastWest contradictions and term them a threat to world peace, thus making it a matter for judgment on the part of all members of the international community.\n27.\tThere are ethical reasons and historical, geographic and cultural links that tie us to our sister States and prevent us from turning a blind eye to their tragedy. We are staunch defenders of the principle of nonintervention and of the right of peoples to self-determination but we reject the argument that to. express that concern and to point to its causes, the parties involved and its effects constitutes interference in the affairs of others. Central American and Caribbean tragedies are not alien to us, for we are Central Americans, we are Caribbean.\n28.\tTo deplore and to denounce genocidal terror and the dreadful violation of human rights that has taken place in that region and to pass judgment on the causes of the conflict cannot be termed foreign interference. Foreign interference is support for one or the other of this contending parties by means of financial, technical or military assistance. Moreover, we believe it is equally harmful for the peace and security of the whole region to resort to threats of reprisal or military intervention or economic retribution as ways of influencing the decisions of any State in the area.\n29.\tAll forms of foreign participation in Central American conflicts must be ended immediately. This means that all types of outside intervention must cease, not only some of them, not only those of a certain origin or type or those intended to help a particular contender or group in the struggle. Any sort of help given to one or another of those involved in the conflict will cause the deaths of thousands of innocent people.\n30.\tNo overall solution can be achieved by purely military means. Panama considers that political solutions must be negotiated in order to end these conflicts, and this can be done only with the participation of all sectors in the various countries that are involved in the struggles. We agree that, in the search for peaceful solutions, the organization of a democratic electoral process is one part or aspect of the whole, but we must honestly point out that such elections must be preceded by the creation of an adequate social and political climate that will guarantee the free and safe participation of the different sectors.\n31.\tWith the desire to contribute to the achievement of such political solutions, Panama offers its territory and its good offices to encourage contacts and negotiations to that end.\n32.\tThe end of the terrible civil strife afflicting El Salvador will be followed by all sorts of problems that the prostrate nation will be unable to remedy with only its war devastated resources. We know that that was the painful experience of Nicaragua. Wide-scale foreign cooperation of all types will be indispensable to enable these countries to recover and to regain the rhythm of their basic activities.\n33.\tWe welcome the proposals to set up an international emergency fund aimed at overcoming the problems connected with the economic and social development of Central America and the Caribbean region. However, we believe that the plan will be stillborn if it  implies discrimination against some countries of the region or provides for any type of military material, interventionist aspects or political conditions. It must not be forgotten that we, the people of Central America, aspire to development in freedom, with unlimited respect for our independence, our right to self-determination and our real sovereignty and that, therefore, we prefer poverty to chaining ourselves and our hopes to the chariot of any foreign force.\n34.\tPanama will join such an effort if it is based on the clear and just requirements of respect for the sovereignty of all the recipient countries, their own decisions and their freedom to choose alternatives, forms of development and sources of financing without limitations imposed by the private initiatives of transnational corporations.\n35.\tFurthermore, my country is happy to greet the emergence in the area of a new and independent republic and we offer Belize a warm welcome. This event spells the end of the most obvious vestige of colonialism in Central America and is therefore of profound significance. Thus, Belize has become a Member of this Organization, of the Organization of American States and of the non aligned movement. It therefore now behooves all of us to contribute to the strengthening of the young State of Belize and to ensure respect for its sovereign rights and its territorial integrity. We are sure that the Government of Guatemala will find the appropriate moment to join the rest of the States Members, of the United Nations in recognizing this peace-loving neighbor and will decide upon* peaceful negotiations as a way of settling their differences and establishing fruitful cooperation with Belize. Panama offers its readiness to assist in that endeavor.\n36.\tWe wish to reiterate what Panama has declared in the past, that in order to dissipate the tense atmosphere created in the Caribbean that also affects so many other countries, both the United States and Cuba should strive to establish and widen effective means of communication and dialog Thus, too, the United States, Nicaragua and Grenada should avoid any further deterioration in their dealings with one another. To some we appeal for respect for the right of self-determination, and to others, for flexibility and consistency towards the other countries of the region.\n37.\tWe endorse the legitimate aspiration of the peoples of Argentina to recover their sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands; those of Bolivia to obtain by peaceful means access to the sea under Bolivian sovereignty; those of Puerto Rico to obtain the full exercise of their inalienable rights to self-determination as an essentially Latin American nation whose separate identity was already included among the objectives of the Amphictyonic Congress held in Panama in 1826.\n38.\tConcerning southern Africa, we reaffirm Panama's unreserved support for the aspirations of the peoples of Namibia and Azania and at the same time we reaffirm our solidarity with the front-line States and the movement of liberation of southern Africa, represented by the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the African National Congress [ANC] of South Africa.\n39.\tWe condemn the unjust and cruel aggression committed by the racist regime of Pretoria against the People's Republic of Angola, an outrage that constitutes an insult to the United Nations system.\n40.\tMy country hopes that as a result of the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, which took place at the beginning of this month, and in keeping with the Panama Declaration and program of Action on Namibia, adopted this year in my country by the United Nations Council for Namibia [see A/36/327, annex], the members of the international community will redouble their efforts to achieve the prompt independence of Namibia, in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations Council for Namibia, the Organization of African Unity [OAU], the nonaligned movement, the General Assembly and the Security Council.\n41.\tWe reaffirm the urgency of eliminating colonialism, racism, racial discrimination and apartheid from southern Africa, Our mission must be to combat the rebirth in South Africa of Nazism, of racial intolerance and of policies based on terrorism, exercised as a function of the State by the Pretoria regime.\n42.\tTurning to the north of the African continent,' Panama supports the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara and recognizes the existence of the Government of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic, with which the Republic of Panama enjoys diplomatic relations.\n43.\tPanama must insist on the urgency of ensuring respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and nonaligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. Foreign military occupation of the island is unjustified and must be terminated. We must encourage progress in the inter-communal talks aimed at the restoration of calm, peace and the inalienable, rights of the people of Cyprus, thus promoting peaceful relations among the States of the eastern Mediterranean region.\n44.\tMy country advocates the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region of the Middle East, based on the withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab lands, the right of Israel and neighboring States to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and the exercise of the inalienable rights of self-determination by the Palestinian people, including its right to its own independent State, with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as its sole legitimate representative.\n45.\tPanama does not believe that the United Nations can remain unmoved by the loss of life and the regrettable bloodshed and material damage taking place in Lebanon. All the resources of the Organization must be brought to bear to ensure respect for the decisions of the Security Council, so that peace can be restored to that beleaguered nation, and a resumption of the bombing of the civilian population and of military and terrorist actions, prevented, with due respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of the country.\n46.\tAs a true believer in the principle of non-use of force in international relations and in the peaceful settlement of disputes, Panama urges an end to the occupation of Afghanistan by foreign forces, pursuant to the decision of the General Assembly [resolution ES6/2]. We also denounce the recent attack on a nuclear reactor in Iraq, which led to a condemnation of that act by the Security Council in its resolution 487 (1981). My country also feels deeply the painful continuation of the military conflict between Iran and Iraq, two nonaligned States to whom we appeal fraternally to put an end to that fratricidal war and settle their differences peacefully.\n47.\tWith regard to the situation in Kampuchea, although Panama recognizes the People's Republic of Kampuchea as the sole legitimate Government, we feel that efforts should be redoubled to create the necessary conditions for the maintenance of peace and stability in the region of SouthEast Asia.\n48.\tWe share the aspirations of the Korean people to the peaceful reunification of their homeland. The Government of Panama considers that the solution of the Korean question is indissolubly linked to the full exercise of the right to self-determination by the Korean people, free from any foreign interference. That would be possible if, as we hope, the SouthNorth Joint Communique of 4 July 19721 were fully implemented, since it is based on the principles of independence, peaceful unification and great national unity.\n49.\tNot only in Latin America, Africa and Asia, however, are there conflicts and tensions which cause deep concern. At the moment, Europe is going through a delicate crisis which, notwithstanding its complexity, also mirrors the problems of the nonaligned countries. The struggle for independence, social justice and peace are not the sole monopoly of those of us in the third world who have until recently served as scapegoats. That same struggle is now being carried on by the peoples and Governments of Europe, which have also suffered civil wars and the devastating effects of two World Wars.\n50.\tIn the light of all this, we warmly welcome European efforts to take an independent and praiseworthy position in the face of the growing arms spiral and polarization. We endorse the effort to spare Europeans the horror of being in the front line of a nuclear war.\n51.\tWe are moved by the profound ideological debate that is gradually encompassing all of Europe and that bears on the continent's right to live in peace and independence, free from the blackmail of the superPowers, which assume the right to divide Europe up with no concern for its legitimate interests. We too reject the strategy of turning whole European countries into launching pads and targets for increasingly murderous missiles which, whatever the outcome, would not strike their launchers.\n52.\tNor can we condone the growing pressure being put on the will of the people and the Government of Poland. As was the case in El Salvador, we consider that the Polish people are undergoing a crisis whose root causes are domestic and whose solution must flow from agreement among the Polish people themselves and, first and foremost, among the workers. Let there be an end to threats mid foreign interference. Let us not forget that the last time there was interference by foreign forces in Poland, Europe and mankind paid the price in the form of millions of dead. The Poles, and those of us who desire the survival of Europe and mankind, must strive to build bridges to a peaceful settlement of that crisis.\n53.\tThus it is that from Latin America, and imbued with the spirit of the last understanding arrived at by Marshal Tito and General Torrijos during the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held at Havana in 1979, we stretch out our hands to the people and Governments of Europe in a plea for an alliance with the nonaligned movement so that together we can come out in defense of the right of mankind to live in full respect for political and cultural plurality.\n54.\tIn line with our anti-colonialist, independent and nonaligned policies, Panama, as a member of the Ibero American community of nations, appeals for genuine negotiations in order to restore the territorial integrity of Spain by returning to Spanish heritage and sovereignty the territory known as the Rock of Gibraltar, which is occupied by England despite the rights of its legitimate sovereign, Spain.\n55.\tMany of the problems to which I have referred are closely linked to the injustice and disorder that prevail in international economic relations, and particularly to what is included in the so-called NorthSouth dialog. We should like to see a restructuring of the international economic order, which is not only a necessity that brooks no delay for the poor and exploited countries, but also a necessity for many of the industrialized nations. Unfortunately, in that \\\"dialog\\\" things seem to have taken a different tack since some of the superPowers seem blindly and recklessly determined to turn it into a dialog of the deaf.\n56.\tYet, to tell the truth, we must admit that many of the difficulties lie in the fact that we ourselves, we of the \\\"South\\\", have not progressed enough to be able to come to agreement and put forward a joint development program. What success we may be able to obtain from such \\\"NorthSouth negotiations\\\" can never be greater than that which we may have previously been able to achieve by agreement among ourselves.\n57.\tPanama attaches the highest priority to its participation in the Group of 77. That Group is an invaluable tool with which to achieve more just economic relations and to strive for the goals of the developing nations aimed at the establishment of a new international order. In this connection, we enthusiastically support the program of Action and the machinery adopted by the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77, held in May 1981 at Caraballeda, Venezuela, on economic cooperation among the developing countries.\n58.\tWe believe that it is indispensable to achieve coordination and concerted action among the groups of Latin American, African and Asian States in order further to strengthen the unity and effectiveness of the Group of 77 in the promotion of our common interests.\n59.\tIn 1975 the Latin American countries, meeting in Panama, decided to create the Latin American Economic System [S\u00a3LA]. That system seeks coordinated and concrete solutions to our development processes and is an organizational instrument with which to coordinate Latin American plans within the regional economies. It is also intended to meet the objective of ensuring a qualitative exchange in our economic relations with the United States, in keeping with our own social and economic priorities.\n60. This justifies the decision of the Latin American Council of SELA to adopt a global approach to those relations which would go beyond the mere commercial aspects. To that end, SELA has decided to hold a meeting in Panama to define the main lines and components of a Latin American policy concerning the United States, so as to solve the problems created by the imbalance in trade relations between the region and that country. That event will have two stages: a preparatory stage of a technical nature from 23 to 27 November, and a second one at a higher level on 30 November and 1 December 1981. The Panamanian Government is relying upon the participation of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States members of SELA for that second stage. At that time we shall provide air transportation to Saint Lucia where, on 2 December, the eleventh session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States is due to open.\n61.\tToday, we wish to bring before the Assembly a subject that has, in the past, already received its careful attention, It is one that involves the interests of a major portion of the world community as well as of Latin America and also has a bearing on the plans and hopes of all nations of the third world, since it touches on the principles and practices that should prevail in relations between a small country and a great Power. I refer to relations between Panama and the United States in the matter of the inter-oceanic canal and the full compliance with the terms of the treaties concerning it.\n62.\tThe relations between Panama and the United States that were established during the building and functioning of the canal date back to 1903. The Panama Canal Agreement of 1903 had a definite colonialist imprint, and since its entry into force there have been open divergences regarding its .interpretation and implementation.\n63.\tBecause of its territorial sovereignty over the Canal, Panama always argued that the powers granted to the United States were limited to the specific purposes of the Canal concession, whereas the recipient of that concession contended that it possessed absolute authority. On the strength of this unilateral interpretation, the so-called Canal Zone was placed under a public administration other than that of the Government of the Republic of Panama and subject to ordinances emanating from a foreign Power to be carried out by officials who were alien, and at times hostile, to Panamanian authorities.\n64.\tSeven decades of confrontation and 14 years of intricate negotiations culminated on 7 September 1977 in the signing in Washington by the President of the United States, Mr. Jimmy Carter, and the head of Government of the Republic of Panama, General Omar Torrijos Herrera, of the Panama Canal Treaty and the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal.\n65.\tThe main purpose of the Torrijos-Carter treaties was to eliminate a situation of a colonial nature by which one State exercised jurisdiction over an important portion of another State's territory, to restore the full sovereignty of the State which had suffered such limitations and to guarantee the restoration of the Canal to its legitimate owner, even though only after such a lengthy period as that ending in 1999.\n66.\tAccording to the 1977 Treaty, the former relationship of subjection was replaced by one of cooperation on an equal footing for purposes of mutual interest and benefit. It was in this spirit that Panama granted to the United States for a given period of time certain rights for the purposes of the operation, maintenance and protection of the Canal, subject to the increasing participation of Panama during the period ending on 31 December 1999, at which time the Canal would revert to its territorial sovereignty in a proper operational condition.\n67.\tDespite the above, in September 1979 the United States Congress enacted Public Act No. 9670, which distorts the meaning, sense and intention of that Treaty. With full awareness of the meaning of our words, we affirm that, instead of laying the foundations for the fulfillment of that Treaty, Public Act No. 9670 set it aside and substituted provisions that hampered the fulfillment of its principles and objectives. These had been to eliminate the colonial enclave or, which is tantamount to the same thing, to dismantle what had been known as a \\\"Government within a Government\\\", to establish a regime of cooperation for the administration, maintenance and protection of the Canal and to make an efficient waterway available to Panama and the international community.\n68.\tThrough the understanding that emerged from the lengthy debates during the negotiations, the Tonrrijos-Carter treaty created a bi-national Commission, called \\\"Panama Canal Commission\\\", to administer the Canal, and it was clearly defined as an entity that was separate and different from the executive machinery of. the United States.\n69.\tPublic Act No. 9670 confers on the President and the Secretary of Defense of the United States undue powers in that Commission; it reduces the latter's administrative powers and confers on the United States Congress itself such authority in basic matters touching on the administration of the Canal that it converts the Commission into a mere offshoot of the Executive of the United States. This creates a serious problem in the efficient handling of transit through the Canal and causes grave obstacles to the proper implementation of a Treaty that embodied the decisions of two nations. To set aside the legitimate interests of Panama in the application of the Torrijos-Carter treaty is tantamount to negating the Treaty itself.\n70.\tIt would take far too long and tax the patience of the Assembly to list all the negative consequences and repercussions of Public Act No. 9670 for the administration of the Canal and on PanamanianUnited States relations. Although all are equally serious, I shall limit myself to mentioning only the most outstanding and leave it to the permanent representative of my country here to complete the documentary information concerning the problems faced in the implementation of the Treaty.\n71.\tFirst of all, the reduction in the administrative powers of the Canal Commission encourages the application of numerous United States federal laws on Panamanian soil and, even more serious, the establishment on that soil of United States administrative bodies that interfere in important aspects of the Canal administration without any legal basis. This is true of the Federal Authority for labor Relations, the Board of the Staff of the Canal Zone the Civil Service Commission, the Appeals Board for the Canal Zone and other official United States entities which either already existed or were expressly created to perform tasks which should be performed by the Panama Canal Commission.\n72.\tThere is another important consequence of this situation. According to Public Act No. 9670, the only funds on which the Commission can count to pay its expenses are the income from the Canal. This means that the bi-national Commission cannot obtain any form of credit to cover a potential deficit or undertake investments or incur special expenses beyond its income for the fiscal period concerned. These constraints affect the financial viability of the Commission and its ability to carry out work necessary to maintain the Canal in a condition to meet the needs of inter-oceanic transit.\n73.\tSome months ago the waterway was faced with serious problems that caused prolonged delays in the transit of ships. The expected increase in inter-oceanic traffic requires repair work to the bed of the Canal so as to ensure its ability to take uninterrupted day and night traffic until well into the twenty-first century. The pertinent programs have already been drawn up and their cost has been estimated at $500 million. The restraints imposed by Public Act No, 9670 make it impossible for the Commission to acquire the funds necessary to carry out these works.\n74.\tThe financial situation of the Commission is further worsened by the series of charges imposed by Public Act No. 9670 and flowing from the former Panama Canal Company, a body whose existence and creation were challenged by Panama. Thus, for example, the amortization of the costs of early retirement and compensation to employees of the earlier Canal entity and the non-recovered costs incurred prior to the coming into force of the Torrijos-Carter treaty, have reduced the assets of the Commission by more than $60 .million per year.\n75.\tAccording to articles I and III of the Torrijos-Carter treaty, the Republic of Panama, as territorial sovereign, grants to the United States of America for a limited time the rights necessary to ensure the operation, maintenance, improvement and protection of the Canal, its 'outworks, installations and auxiliary equipment and, to provide the necessary resources to guarantee and regulate the flow of navigation and traffic through the inter-oceanic waterway. The United States accepts the concession and, inter alia, commits itself to the transfer of the Canal to Panama on expiry of the concession in an operational condition. As a necessary counterpart to such rights, the United States assumes the obligation of providing the funds required to ensure the functioning of the Canal. This is an indispensable requisite to guarantee uninterrupted passage by vessels and to satisfy the needs of international shipping throughout the entire period during which the United States will exercise those rights granted to it in the Treaty by Panama.\n76.\tConsequently, the only logical interpretation is that when the Treaty stipulates that, on its expiry, the United States shall transfer the Canal to Panama \\\"in operating condition\\\", that condition must be such as to guarantee that the Canal will be capable of providing the services expected of it. Therefore, if thus far the United States has not fulfilled its obligation to carry out the maintenance work required by the Canal during the existence of the concession, the waterway will not be in a condition to serve its users on the expiry of the Treaty.\n77.\tIn the field of labor relations, Public Act. No. 9670 gives a number of powers to the President of the United States and to several United States Government offices which have the effect of creating a \\\"Government within a Government\\\". One of those offices, the Civilian Personnel Policy Coordinating Board, u> given the powers of establishing wage scales already put into effect by the Canal Commission and by the Armed Forces of the United States still stationed in the Canal area. Such provisions violate the principle of equal pay for equal work and establish differences among workers and employees on the basis of their date of employment. In fact, that leads to a reduction in the salaries of those employees, mainly Panamanians, who were recruited after the entry into force of the Torrijos-Carter treaty. This will mean that, for the duration of the life of the Treaty, the Panamanian economy will suffer an estimated loss of $4 billion, according to figures of the administrative organs of the Canal Commission itself.\n78. The application of Public Act No. 9670 to labor relations has given rise to grave problems, which have in turn caused serious dissatisfaction among the workers and employees of the Canal Commission and which ultimately might affect the functioning of the inter-oceanic waterway.\n79. In a word, the injustices and inconsistencies of Public Act No. 9670 not only conflict with the aim of eliminating the \\\"Government within a Government\\\", but create unnecessary problems that are difficult to solve if that law is not soon considerably amended so as to bring it into line with the spirit and the letter of the Treaty. In fact, foreseeing those problems which have indeed arisen in the implementation of the Treaty, the Republic of Panama made approaches at the appropriate time for the necessary amendments to the said United States law. However, few of the observations made were taken into consideration when the law was enacted.\n80. On 9 January 1980, a short time after the law came into force, I addressed a lengthy note to Mr. Jimmy Carter, then President of the United States, in which I indicated the flaws in Public Act No. 9670, and repeated the desire of my Government that our comments be taken into account; and to support that request the Panamanian representatives submitted to the Board of the Canal Commission a file of observations that the Government of Panama desired the Congress of the United States to consider.\n81. The Panamanians hope that, if that file of observations is given a favorable reception, the Government and the Congress of the United States will then be able to fulfill completely the duties and commitments assumed by that country under the watchful eyes of the world when the 1977 Treaties were approved. From those Treaties there should flow a new and just relationship between our two peoples and States and an encouraging example for other nations represented in this Assembly. Otherwise, the small nations, the peoples of the third world and the international community will doubtless.take.it very much to heart, since it would affect their trust in the sincerity and good faith of international agreements with the great Powers. We prefer to believe in that sincerity and that good faith. We are ready for wide-ranging talks that will lay the foundations for an understanding in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the Torrijos-Carter treaties, otherwise friction might affect the efficient peaceful use of the Panamanian water way. However, we are encouraged by the formal promise made by. President Reagan on 4 December last when he stated that \\\"the United States will continue to respect and fully implement the Panama Canal Treaties\\\". We agree with President Reagan when he immediately added \\\"with this spirit of cooperation and mutual respect we can achieve the aim shared by both, of peace and prosperity in all Latin America and throughout the world.\\\"\n82.\tThis must surely mean a consequential radical amendment of Public Act No. 9670 to bring it into conformity with the letter and the spirit of the Treaties. Once that has been done, we shall take care to inform the world that that sincerity and good faith of which I have spoken has in fact been confirmed.\n83.\tThere is one other aspect in which both the interests of Panama and those of the international community are basically at one. I refer to the regime of neutrality of the Panama Canal, as declared by the Panamanian State in the Torrijos-Carter treaties and for which we require the respect and adherence of all States in the world.\n84. Panama attaches immense importance to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the effectiveness Of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco). In the opinion of my Government, there, is a close relationship between those international instruments and the regime of neutrality of the Panama Canal. Thus we are justified in hoping that, through IAEA, protective measures will be established to guard against the potential danger of accidents or contamination involving nuclear-powered vessels. We also trust that the Agency will adopt the necessary measures to ensure the provision of insurance and adequate means of compensation in such cases.\n85. In conclusion, we believe it timely to reiterate that the international community cannot fail to recognize that she declared neutrality of the Panama Canal does not remove the Canal from the jurisdiction and competence of the Panamanian State. For the sake of world peace all nations must, in accordance with the Charter of San Francisco, scrupulously observe unqualified respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of a State which, as in the case of Panama, facilitates international shipping through an inter-oceanic canal located in its territory, without impinging upon the sovereign and permanent rights of the Panamanian State over its natural resources.\n36. Through me, the people of Panama once again wish to pay a tribute to the outstanding work that the President, the Secretary-General and the United Nations have done in the service of mankind.\n87. Let us not be overcome by difficulties or by limitations. All of mankind is facing a difficult moment, but Panama believes in dialog, in negotiation and in respect for the dignity and the cultural and political diversity of the peoples of the world.\n88. Panama believes in the equality of States as a basis for frank and balanced discussions. We believe in those who devise solutions and not in those who exploit problems. Above all, we believe that those of us who have neither the intention nor the means to disturb peaceful coexistence in the world must earn peace by fighting ceaselessly against the true causes of conflicts and against those who try to take advantage of them and thus sacrifice present and future generations.\n89.\tThis, then, is an expression of the sincere desire for peace, justice and progress of the Panamanian nation.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me at the outset to extend to you my congratulations on your election. We are sure that under, your able leadership this session of the General Assembly will achieve favorable results for the international community. I should also like to convey to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, our gratitude for the splendid way in which he carried out his duties during the last session of the General Assembly.\n68.\tI should like also to express the satisfaction and warmth with which we welcome to this Hall the delegation of the Republic of Vanuatu, which has recently joined the United Nations.\n69.\tUruguay is participating in this session in the same spirit as has always inspired the international life of our Republic. We have come here to build and to consolidate, to discuss and to understand, to add our efforts to the work and the significance of the Organization, in which all members of the community of nations are. represented.\n70.\tWe feel that this is an opportunity for us, the Member States, to renew our commitment to the Charter, so that the essential purposes for which it was created may once again be clearly before us and guide and direct our debates. We are here to promote international peace and security, to establish friendly relations among States based on equality of rights and the self-determination of peoples, to foster international cooperation and to coordinate the efforts of all nations in order to give priority attention to those most in need.\n71.\tEvery day we are moving closer to becoming a worldwide community, and every day the possibility of isolated incidents opposing that end becomes more remote. We must understand that the community of nations will find increasingly intolerable actions that run counter to these principles which must ultimately inspire us all.\n72.\tOver and above the specific matters that are being debated, the nations represented here are by their very presence demonstrating their determination to live in peace under the rule of law. It is our hope that that determination will be translated without delay into practical and concrete action.\n73.\tMy country here and now reaffirms that hope, which is a demonstration of faith as well as a restatement of commitment, and we appeal to all nations to unite in the faithful carrying out of those principles, which is an historical imperative demanded by international public opinion.\n74.\tI should like to refer to some of the aspects of international reality related to the work of the Assembly. This review of various matters will be carried out from the viewpoint of my country, which participates actively in world affairs within the group of medium-sized and small States, which constitutes the great majority of the nations of the world, upon whom mankind is placing its highest hopes for moderation, balance and sensibility in the service of international peace.\n75.\tAs in previous years, we are today facing serious problems and political tension, which unfortunately have been impossible to overcome. The Middle East continues to be a cause for special concern and anguish. Several proposals have been submitted to resolve that situation of conflict and initiate a move towards peace. The complexity of the problems of the region does not lend itself to easy solutions, and everything points to the imperative need to try out all the options that promise any reasonable hope of success. With that understanding, and in order to prove factually the peaceful vocation and internationalist attitude that have always been typical of my country, we are now considering effective participation in a joint effort in the Sinai area, which could be the beginning of a greater understanding leading to the achievement of a broad and general peace for the benefit of the whole region.\n76.\tThe position of Uruguay is in accordance with its tradition as a peace-loving nation and gives it the opportunity to play a leading role in one of the fundamental stages in the hard struggle waged by mankind in its search for unity among peoples.\n77.\tWe must state our conviction that the State of Israel has the right to exist within safe and recognized borders, in the framework of a just and lasting peace with its neighbors, consistent with the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine to establish and settle in a free and sovereign State.\n78.\tWe are similarly concerned about the situation in Lebanon, a model nation which was able to become an exemplary country, and which continues to suffer the consequences of a conflict which should have been largely concluded by now if passions had been cast aside so that the spirit of agreement could bear fruit. We are making a new appeal that Lebanon be allowed to live again in the peace that it deserves, as my country declared in its public statement issued last May, expressing our deep concern about the seriousness of the situation in Lebanon and demanding that the international community of the United Nations shoulder its responsibility in order to solve that crisis through just arrangements that respect Lebanon's territorial integrity and the right of its people to decide its own destiny.\n79.\tAs far as Afghanistan is concerned, we have strongly condemned the invasion of its territory and emphasize that it creates a dangerous point of friction and conflict which must be solved as soon as possible. Within that context, we supported the proposal submitted by Lord Carrington [8th meeting] on behalf of the European Community, which deserves to be given the fullest consideration and to be implemented promptly, overcoming the obstacles which are basically due to the political interests directly involved in the situation.\n80.\tIn the same context, we should stress the importance we attach to the achievement of a peaceful and independent solution to the reunification of Korea, by means of an interKorean dialog which should contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for a mutual understanding, as well as for general stability in that area. The role of intermediary played by the SecretaryGeneral and his good offices made available to South and North Korea deserve to be encouraged.\n81.\tIn defense of the principle of self-determination of peoples, Uruguay supports the right of the people of Namibia to achieve its independence and its own political system, without external intervention and within the framework guaranteed by the United Nations. We reiterate our wish for a prompt solution with participation of the Organization. The events which have taken place in that area should be condemned and make more urgent the need for the solution we have just called for.\n82.\tIn this connection, as we stress the importance of complying with the principles of the Charter, we should also mention the situation in our sister region of Central America. Here again, we must demand nonintervention in the internal affairs of States and the recognition of the right of self-determination of the nations involved.\n83.\tOur country, which has a clear and unmistakable tradition of respect for the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States, has felt deeply concerned, and has said so publicly, at the acts of unjustified intervention originating in a statement which has caused a well-grounded reaction from a large number of Latin American countries, among them our own.\n84.\tWe similarly reject the continuous intervention in the internal affairs of States on the part of the authorities and the official media of other countries, which improperly express their support or understanding for persons and groups who are attacking or have attacked their own homelands.\n85.\tWe have mentioned those situations first because those are problems that urgently need to be solved. Their solution is urgent because of the suffering of the peoples involved and because the world public refuses to remain indifferent to those sufferings and is becoming increasingly skeptical due to the apparent inability of the machinery of the United Nations system to solve those problems.\n86.\tIn conjunction with the aforementioned situations, we have also to consider an ever increasing number of serious problems which involve and affect all mankind. We are refereeing to hunger and poverty, violence and terrorism, the existence Of large masses of displaced persons, the arms race and the trade in armaments and human rights, capriciously interpreted and systematically violated in large areas of the world.\n87.\tWe may therefore ask which are the gravest violations of the principles of the Organization: the insolence of a merciless invader, or the lack of tolerance which leads to the cruelest forms of blind and indiscriminate destruction carried out by elements which attack society. Both are expressions of the same phenomenon: the insanity of man inspired by violence. The most dramatic example this year was the criminal attack on the Holy Father, who is perhaps the noblest symbol of the values of our contemporary culture.\n88.\tThe insanity of entire peoples inspired by violence strikes at the conscience of mankind every time a group of persons arrogates the right to execute a human being, to displace a people or to attempt genocide. The large and ever increasing number of victims of those actions constitutes the most serious charge that can be made concerning the state of development and progress of the international community and compels us to consider how that community could most strongly and effectively express its outright rejection of situations that are distorting man's true nature. We wonder whether rivalry among nations is eradicating the basic need for unity which will prevent us from fighting each other. We ask ourselves what we should do in order to fight successfully against poverty and hunger and for health and education, to enhance the dignity of life and ennoble mankind.\n89.\tIt is worthwhile at this stage to consider these matters in their full dimension. The international community must rearrange its bonds of interdependence or else face a catastrophe in which a large part of mankind may perish and the rest will surely experience great suffering. The dangers are enormous; paradoxically, they are as great as the greatest progress of mankind. We are going through a period in the history of the world when we can no longer be blinded by the unlimited power and technological skill of the dominant forces. Everything indicates that action for peace and the survival of man with dignity is a task for all of us, a daily task which cannot be postponed, and which is a challenge to the intelligence and perspicacity of mankind.\n90.\tThe scourge of famine and poverty demands that the Assembly direct its attention to the report recently published by the World Bank on the desperate plight of some 800 million people living in conditions of absolute poverty. This report is fundamentally addressed to the industrialized countries and warns them that the health of their economies is directly linked to that of the developing countries, adding that it is an illusion for the industrialized countries to believe that they are immune from the problems faced by the developing world.\n91.\tThat document, coming from such an impeccable source, presents with objectivity and candor a situation which affects all mankind and which we cannot ignore.\n92.\tOur country is deeply involved in this matter, as a developing nation that fortunately does not suffer from famine and has large resources to contribute to the world's food supply, but which, thanks to the action of third parties, is faced with serious trade problems with regard to our products. We shall consider these matters in a moment.\n93.\tIn our opinion, these are the great problems of the organized international community. They call for our attention, put our system to the test and show decisively the primary responsibility of the great Powers and their leaders.\n94.\tAs opposed to these problems, which are a source of shame, there are on the other hand new conquests and new frontiers in the continuous progress of man's adventures in the universe. Thus today we envisage with optimism and hope the exploitation of the resources of the sea and the seabed, the environment and the ecological balance, and outer space and its use for peaceful purposes.\n95.\tWe wish to make a few brief observations on the work being done in the United Nations in these fields. With respect to international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, our country has cooperated directly in the elaboration of the legal instruments which are being prepared on this matter and advocates the establishment of an international authority for the rational administration of the various aspects of such a complex matter.\n96.\tConcerning the environment and environmental protection, it should be recalled that the survival of man depends upon the preservation of the productive resources of the earth hence the fundamental importance of a sound environmental policy which will ensure its preservation, since the environment is the infrastructure for development as well as for life itself. These concepts, far from being in opposition, are complementary and reinforce each other.\n97.\tOur country has been deeply aware from the beginning of this drama of our century and has contributed to the development of an effective environmental policy in all the international forums in which it takes part. For example, Uruguay was not only a sponsor of a Swedish Canadian proposal to convene a high-level world meeting on environmental law, but has the honor of being the host country for that meeting. The essential idea underlying this international event is that, without suitable legal instruments both functional and institutional* all the recommendations and measures recommended by scientific research on the environment and approved by experts and diplomats will be of no avail. Uruguay is honored to be the host country of a meeting which will surely be one of the most important meetings of the decade following the\nConference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in 1972.\n98.\tWith respect to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the work done by the Third Conference, which after long and hard negotiations produced an official draft convention, should without fail end next year.\n99.\tDuring the second part of the tenth session some very effective measures were adopted to solve some of the few matters still outstanding, and the program of work which was adopted provides for the approval of the draft convention and its opening for signature in 1982. There can no longer be any alteration or postponement of this goal.\n100.\tWithin the framework for the completion of the draft convention, the United States will have the opportunity to submit its points of view specifically and precisely, on the understanding that the bases that have already been negotiated in good faith and in a conciliatory spirit must be respected. The work carried out after so many sacrifices and so much effort may be adjusted but cannot be disregarded, and in any case we shall have a convention on the law of the sea.\n101.\tWe are open to dialog, but in the sphere of principles there can be no hesitation. It is our firm hope that this will be understood by all, and that we shall all be ready to adopt a convention of universal scope, firmly undertaking the historic responsibility of establishing a balanced legal order which will lay the groundwork for a comprehensive system of international cooperation and organize the rational exploitation of the resources of the sea, the seabed and its subsoil in accordance with the principle of international justice, thus ensuring peace in the oceans.\n102.\tIn the field of international economic affairs our country has been taking part in the various specialized forums, contributing actively to the establishment of the courses of action espoused by the developing countries. As part of that active participation, Uruguay had the honor to be the host country for the nineteenth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America [ECLA], held in Montevideo from 4 to 15 May 1981. At that meeting the Regional program of Action was adopted with the aim of complementing the national and regional efforts by international cooperation in the context of the International Development Strategy.\n103.\tA resolution on energy was adopted in Montevideo, by which it was decided that the Secretariat of ECLA should carry out studies so that the region could have timely and updated information on available energy resources and on regional and world supply and demand in the energy market.\n104.\tI would make some remarks of a general nature to emphasize the difficulties that confront nations with limited economic potential in a world that allegedly is interdependent but in fact is ruled by the concept of predominance, contrary to the solidarity that should prevail in relations among nations.\n105.\tWith respect to international trade, we have in recent years been constantly concerned about all the forms of increasing and senseless protectionism applied by the industrialized countries, with total indifference to the fate of those countries that, depending as they do on their external trade, are continually finding closed their opportunities for access to the markets of the developed nations. it has repeatedly been pointed out, so far to no avail, that it is necessary to carry out a structural readjustment on the part of the developed countries so as to allow for the growth of industries, most often primary industries, in the developing countries.\n106.\tThere is a particularly annoying situation which occurs when traditional exports from developing countries are displaced from new markets, opened up at a cost of immense sacrifices, by exports which enjoy large subsidies from industrialized countries. The incongruity of this situation is even greater when the products being exported on a subsidized basis are produced by the industrialized countries under policies directed towards the maintenance of totally anti-economic or even artificial activities.\n107.\tThese examples are not theoretical cases, as far as my country is concerned. They reflect situations which regularly confront the basic exports of our national economic activity. Such conditions produce a most harmful effect on the domestic situation and since they are the result of decisions adopted elsewhere, beyond our reach, they impose an unfair burden on countries with limited potential.\n108.\tThe developing countries are not prepared to resign themselves to this situation. They have unsuccessfully demanded that the decisions of international institutions be taken in a more open manner, and have demanded a larger participation in their adoption.\n109.\tThe effects of the aforementioned subsidies on the development process are so serious that our country must advance new strong statements in the relevant organizations with a view to rectifying such unfair procedures once and for all.\n110.\tWe consider that a specific comment should be made on the tasks now being carried out in the field of economic cooperation among developing countries. Since the beginning of this program there has been a lack of understanding and perspective on the part of the developed countries, who have not realized the importance of generous cooperation in this effort. This fact, on the one hand, and the difficulties in launching the global negotiations on the other, have driven the developing countries to begin a most significant attempt to establish a South South dialog through the implementation of a broad scheme of economic cooperation.\n111.\tOur country is participating with hope and enthusiasm in these initiatives, not only with a view to broadening the basis of its economy, but also in order to demonstrate our solidarity with the other developing countries. In order best to achieve the goals which inspire this effort of the developing countries, all the member countries of (he international community have pledged the support of the relevant organizations of the United Nations system. The time has come for this support to be made fully effective, thus proving the will stated by every nation to contribute in an effective manner to action directed towards the raising of the standards of living of our peoples by their own efforts, an attitude which nobody has ever opposed.\n112.\tIt would be difficult for a country which is a net importer of oil not to take this opportunity to mention the matter of energy. We consider that it is our task today seriously and rapidly to contemplate the creation of m economy based on new and renewable sources of energy. In this respect we must realize that the future is today. We do not want proposals so ambitious that they exceed the possibilities of action, but .we do intend to stretch our imagination and the circumstances so that the United Nations can give a full response to the challenge implied in this situation. We therefore* welcome the work of the Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held recently at Nairobi, and we hope that the program of Action adopted there may soon be implemented through technological and financial means that are in keeping with the establishment of the new international economic order, with a view to meeting as far as possible the future energy needs of the world, and in particular those of the developing countries.\n113.\tUntil solutions based on new and renewable sources of energy are found, we shall have to continue to live with our dependence on oil imports, with its political, economic and financial consequences.\n114.\tWe venture to hope that, without prejudice to the solutions proposed at the world level, those arising from the decisions taken by the Group of 77 will be fully implemented, thus endowing that Group with the solidarity which should prevail among nations at similar stages of development.\n115.\tA country with a structure fundamentally based on temperate zone agriculture and livestock cannot avoid mentioning in this debate the questions of food and agriculture. We wish to emphasize the importance of an effective system of world food security, together with adequate financial mechanisms for the promotion of efficient food production in the developing countries. The system to be set up should include food aid and emergency reserves. But none of this makes sense unless problems related to international food trade are resolved, with prohibition of the unfair and restrictive practices used by regional communities which sacrifice their own consumers and discourage our countries.\n116.\tHere we come to a new and dramatic paradox: developing countries, like Uruguay, where nature and human effort have created ideal conditions for increasing food production, and which strive to make the best use of that source of wealth to build up their prosperity, find to their consternation and annoyance that they are being displaced from their markets by exports that are heavily subsidized. And this is being done by those same countries that for many years have been telling us how desirable it was for us to benefit from our relative advantages by devoting ourselves to agro-industrial activities. To make matters worse, and what is a clear demonstration of the need to reach a new and equitable order in international economic relations, this is happening in a world where the artificial distortion of trade flows goes hand in hand with a vast increase in hunger and poverty, where profits are being reaped by those who are not entitled to them and where exports from the developing countries are facing obstacles of all kinds, including the denial to them of access to markets on the grounds of alleged subsidies, to the detriment of countries which are acting in accordance with agreed international rules governing free and fair competition. All of this should be reviewed in the relevant intergovernmental forums in order to restore on a solid basis the equity and balance that have been lost.\n117.\tIn the field of natural resources, we regard as unquestionable the right of all States to share the natural resources of the planet to the extent of their needs and within a framework of a just balance, without discrimination, intervention or constraint of any kind. This implies a methodical and systematic evaluation of those resources, their best possible use and their exploitation according to suitable environmental policies.\n118.\tLastly, we realize that these and other matters pertaining to the economic aspects of international relations are being considered with a view to reopening global negotiations. We firmly request that such discussions should be transferred as soon as possible to the Assembly, not only for reasons of equity but also because most of the developing countries urgently require adoption by the international community of a harmonious set of actions, duly negotiated in such a way that the injustices resulting from unilateral decisions may be overcome. The global negotiations must give security to international economic relations and, on the basis of interdependence, establish a balanced framework that will provide opportunities for all.\n119.\tThe disappointment of the developing countries at the failure of the work of the committee of the whole on global negotiations is well known, as are their efforts to overcome that situation. The work being done to prepare for the early consideration of the essential elements of an international economic understanding is also well known. Our country cannot but reiterate that the discussions taking place on this matter are of interest to all the members of the international community on a fully equal footing, and that it will be most difficult in the present world to reach any agreement on energy and financing, international trade, protectionism and readjustment, raw materials and food, industrialization and technology, unless the voices and interests of all the countries of the world are represented. We therefore request that these matters be referred back as soon as possible to the United Nations, that formal global negotiations begin promptly on a sound basis, and that exceptions be ended once and for all.\n120.\tWe also wish to mention briefly an aspect of our work that is of fundamental importance. We have examined with keen interest the report of the SecretaryGeneral on the work of the Organization, which realistically reflects the international panorama and the work done by the United Nations. Consideration of that report reinforces our belief that it is necessary to strengthen the system and to make more equitable the representation of Member States in the Security Council. As we see it, the time has come to take up the matter of the increase in the number of non-permanent members of the Security Council, with a view to achieving an equitable geographical distribution between the different areas and regions. The circumstances that prevailed when the Charter was drafted in San Francisco have changed substantially.\n121.\tIn another field, we attach the greatest importance to the work being done to strengthen the United Nations in its task of maintaining and consolidating international peace and security, developing cooperation among nations and promoting the rules of international law in relations between States. Likewise, we consider that the work on procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the revision of the unanimity rule laid down for the benefit of the permanent members at the Security Council are of particular significance. We believe that in these matters we should advance steadily and gradually, proceeding without political considerations to the adoption of rules aimed at securing the full participation in the United Nations system of all its members, as a direct and sure way to achieve the necessary strengthening of the Organization.\n122.\tFinally, I wish to express the unwavering faith of my country in harmonious relations among nations and in understanding among peoples.\n123.\tIn recent years, Uruguay has been through a unique experience. We were, almost before any other country, subjected to the onslaught of international terrorism, which we confronted and defeated by our own means. Today we are marching forward along the path of progress towards the full implementation of the highest national ideals, fully aware of the meaning of our example for other nations.\n124.\tWe were able to come through this difficult experience, which could have meant our destruction, and Uruguay emerged a strong nation, convinced that the best kind of help is self-help. When faced with our own problems we were able to respond with a vote of self-confidence, but to face international problems we all need one another.\n125.\tConsequently, our hope and our message is that in this decade we should all come closer to a comprehensive peace, in a spirit of solidarity and brotherhood, so that the development and stability of all nations may foster the ideal of the United Nations as we move towards the new phases awaiting mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, let me sincerely congratulate you, sir, on your election to the post of President of the General Assembly. We ate confident that under your able and competent guidance the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly will make appropriate progress in resolving the vital problems related to the consolidation of world peace and security.\n285.\tI take this opportunity to point out that relations between the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the country you represent are friendly and continue to develop in various fields to the mutual advantage of our two peoples. I assure you that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan will cooperate fully with you and will do its best to help you in discharging your momentous duties.\n286.\tLet me also express our thanks to Mr. von Wechmar, the outgoing President of the General Assembly. It was thanks to his tireless activity and diplomatic skill that the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly made a contribution to the solution of some topical international issues.\n287.\tThe delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan heartily congratulates the delegation of the Republic of Vanuatu on the admission of the newborn State of Vanuatu to the United Nations. The accession of the Republic of Vanuatu to independence is one more step towards the complete and final liquidation of the abhorrent colonial system. We wish the people of Vanuatu prosperity and every success in political, social and economic development.\n288.\tThe General Assembly begins the work of the current session at a time when the international situation has visibly deteriorated and when new additional efforts and measures are needed to prevent a further worsening of the world climate, to stop the drift towards the danger of war and to reverse the present perilous course of events.\n289.\tThe origin and cause of the present aggravation of international tension are well known to everybody. They are to be found in the reckless warmongering adventurist policies of United States imperialism and Peking's hegemonism. The events of the last few months have amply and convincingly shown that United States imperialism and Chinese hegemonism have staked everything on the use of force and rely on whipping up the arms race and brandishing nuclear weapons. United States imperialism is trying to drive the people of the world into submission by working out plans to deploy their nuclear weapons in various parts of the globe. The White House and the Pentagon arbitrarily declare regions situated far away from the United States as spheres of their \\\"vital interests\\\" and dispatch to those areas the so-called rapid deployment forces. At an ever-increasing pace, they are establishing new military bases all over the world.\n290.\tParticularly dangerous are the United States plans to begin large-scale production of the neutron weapon, that most sophisticated, barbaric and abhorrent means of annihilating the human race. The Afghan people, together with other peace-loving peoples of the world, resolutely condemn their plans and demand that President Ronald Reagan reverse his decision. It is our view that this Assembly should urgently adopt a resolution calling for a ban on the production and deployment of the neutron weapon.\n291.\tIn these grave circumstances, when aggressive imperialist and hegemonist quarters are hurriedly pushing the wodd to the brink of a nuclear holocaust, the appeal of the ^Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the parliaments and peoples of the world, which meets the aspirations of all nations of the globe, is particularly timely. That appeal is a clearcut testimony of the relentless efforts of the Soviet Union to curb the arms race, bring about disarmament and safeguard peace and security in the world.\n292.\tThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is an ancient Asian country and we follow with special concern the latest developments on the Asian continent. The major source of tension in Asia lies in the aggressive ambitions of imperialist, Zionist and hegemonist forces. Those forces are definitely trying to reverse the postwar trends in Asia, to crush the will of the Asian nations to independence, to drag them into fratricidal conflicts and wars, to grab their natural resources, to turn some Asian countries into mere pawns in their imperialist and hegemonist games and to make certain countries the springboards of aggression against the peace-loving countries of Asia.\n293.\tParticularly dangerous for the peoples of Asia are the United States militaristic activities in the Indian Ocean and in the Gulf. The Pentagon is hurriedly building facilities there for the rapid deployment force and for the permanent stationing in that area of at least two aircraft carrier groups. This year alone, $700 million has been allocated for the expansion and modernization of the United States naval and air force bases on the island of Diego Garcia. There is evidence that the Pentagon is. going to use those bases for stockpiling nuclear weapons, including the neutron weapon.\n294.\tIt is not surprising that the United States and its allies torpedoed the work of the last session of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. Apparently they are against the convocation of a conference to work out an international agreement to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. It is the firm view of the Afghan delegation that the Assembly should take a decision to expedite the convening of such a conference no later than next year. We should not allow the imperialist and hegemonist forces to block the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.\n295.\tOne of the most vital problems to be settled is that of the Middle East. It is high time for the Assembly to take effective measures to restore peace in that area, to put an end to Israeli aggression against Arab countries, to liberate lands illegally occupied by the Zionist aggressor and restore the inalienable rights of the Palestinian Arabs, including their right to statehood.\n296.\tIt is now perfectly clear that treacherous Israeli EgyptianUnited States deals and the separate Israeli Egyptian \\\"treaty\\\" did not bring the solution of the Middle East problem an inch nearer. On the contrary, they worsened the situation in that area still further. It is therefore time to go back to a collective search for an all embracing just and realistic settlement of the Middle East conflict within the framework of a Specially convened international conference. It is imperative that, side by side with the other interested parties, the PLO, as the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people, should take part in such a conference.\n297.\tThe recent barbarous Israeli raids against Palestinian civilian targets in southern Lebanon and Beirut, which resulted in 2,567 casualties and the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian hospitals, schools and dwellings, have added a dangerous dimension to the Middle East conflict. The six member mission of the Coordinating Bureau of NonAligned Countries, of which Afghanistan was a member, visited Lebanon from 20 to 23 August to examine and assess the damage and destruction resulting from Israeli attacks on Beirut and southern Lebanon. The report of that mission [Al36/547] determined the genocidal nature of those attacks, which resulted in the death of hundreds of civilians, including the elderly, women and children.\n298.\tEffective measures should be taken to prevent further acts of Israeli aggression against the sovereign State of Lebanon, to frustrate the Zionist plans to dismember Lebanon and to safeguard its territorial integrity. It is also necessary to prevent any repetition of Israeli, aggression and provocations against other Arab countries.\n299.\tThe situation remains tense in the Gulf area as well. This is the result of the deployment by the United States and other Western countries of more naval and air forces there and of the military conflict between Iraq and Iran, which unfortunately still goes on. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan believes that the situation in the Gulf area could be effectively defused by the conclusion of an international agreement along the lines suggested almostt a year ago by the Soviet Union. Such an agreement would safeguard the sovereign rights of the countries of that area and the security of maritime and other communications connecting the region with the rest of the world.\n300.\tThe IraqiIranian war, which began a year ago, is a sad, unfortunate and deplorable event. It is senseless from the viewpoint of IraqiIranian national interests, but is of great advantage to imperialist quarters. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is earnestly in favor of the speediest political settlement of the conflict between the two countries and is ready to help that process in any way possible.\n301.\tTurning our attention to SouthEast Asia, where owing to hegemonist and great chauvinist ambitions the process of normalization is impeded, we restate our staunch support for the constructive initiatives of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic aimed at turning that area into a zone of peace based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and good neighborliness.\n302.\tThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is against any debate here on the so-called Kampuchean question aimed at outright interference in the domestic affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. It is urgent that the lawful rights of the People's Republic of Kampuchea in the United Nations should be restored without delay and that the agents of the bloody Pol Pot gang be thrown out of the Assembly. We do not recognize the decision of the so-called Conference on Kampuchea, which was held despite the strong objections of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.\n303.\tThe delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan would also like to reiterate its solidarity with the constructive efforts of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea aimed at the peaceful democratic reunification of the country. We support the just demand of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and resolutely condemn the Seoul military regime for its repression of the people of South Korea.\n304.\tWe have studied with great interest the latest initiative of the Mongolian People's Republic [Al36!388] to work out and sign a convention on mutual nonaggression and non-use of force in relations among the States of Asia and the Pacific. The practical implementation of that proposal would be a great step forward in normalizing relations in that part of the world.\n305.\tThe imperialist and hegemonist propaganda machine is spreading many malicious and slanderous allegations about events in and around Afghanistan, and is trying to portray those events as a threat to peace and stability in SouthWest Asia. Yet that is nothing but a dirty trick to divert the attention of world public opinion from imperialist and hegemonist aggressive schemes in Asia and other parts of the world. The imperialist media follow the dictum if you repeat a lie one hundred times somebody may believe it. But the sinister attempts to conceal the truth about the Afghan revolution are of no avail; it is impossible to cover the sun with the palm of the hand.\n306.\t\\\"\tAny unbiased observer visiting Afghanistan these days can see with his own eyes that, despite the great difficulties imposed on the Afghan people by the enemies of the Afghan revolution and an undeclared war waged against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan by the imperialist and hegemonist forces and their mercenaries, the people of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, under the leadership of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, have, during a comparatively short period of time, scored great successes along the road of economic, political and social progress.\n307.\tThe overall situation in the country is being consolidated; the organs of the people's power are being strengthened; the political and social foundation of the Government, is being expanded and enhanced.\n308.\tOne of the vivid manifestations of that process was the establishment last June of the National Fatherland Front, which was .joined by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, trade unions, farmers' cooperatives, the Supreme Jirgah of tribes, the High Council of scholars and clergy, the Democratic Organization of Afghan Youth, the Democratic Organization of Afghan Women and others. One can see that the Front represents practically all the classes and strata of the Afghan people supporting the goals of the national democratic revolution.\n309.\tThe Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has taken effective measures to develop the economy, raise the level of industrial and agricultural production and improve the living standards of toiling masses. Despite the economic dislocation and disruptions caused by the armed aggression from outside, the plans for economic and social development and the second* stage of the land reform are being successfully implemented. We have all the grounds for stating from this rostrum that the toiling people of Afghanistan have never lived better than since the April revolution; they have already begun to reap the fruits of a new, just and equitable social system.\n310.\tThose achievements could have been even more impressive but for the continuing armed aggression from the territories of the neighboring countries, mainly from Pakistan. That armed aggression and other forms of intervention are being stirred up by United States imperialists and Chinese hegemonist quarters. Mercenaries are being recruited by those who were deprived of their privileges by the April revolution and who took refuge abroad.\n311.\tAttempts by imperialist propaganda to describe those people as \\\"mujahideen\\\" \\\"freedom fighters\\\", \\\"rebels\\\" and so on are futile. They are nothing but former feudal lords and their lackeys who, like their ancestors, sucked the blood of the Afghan people and lived in luxury, dooming the people to misery and deprivation. They do not fight for the freedom of the Afghan people but for the freedom to exploit them, for the restoration of their lost privileges. Therefore, to think or to talk of those counterrevolutionary mercenaries otherwise is outright hypocrisy; it is an insult to the common sense of the Afghan people.\n312.\tThese bandits daily invade Afghanistan, disrupt normal life in the country, kill our people women, children and the elderly destroy schools and hospitals and loot the people's and the State's property. The Afghan army, police and security forces, supported by the people, deal blow after blow to the bandits, 'capture and disarm them. Captured and repentant mercenaries appear regularly at press conferences held in Kabul for Afghan and foreign journalists.\n313.\tThe Afghan army and people would have wiped out the counterrevolutionary bands long ago had they not been given support from imperialist and hegemonist quarters, as well as from some reactionary Islamic regimes. The counterrevolutionary gangs are paid in United States dollars, British pounds, West German marks, Saudi rials and so on. They are armed with American, British^ Chinese, West German and Egyptian weapons and trained by American, Chinese, Egyptian and Pakistani instructors. Some Western countries have declared the policy of interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan as their official policy.\n314.\tPresident Reagan announced last March that his Government would henceforth supply the so-called Afghan mujahideen with weapons and ammunition. The covert Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] operation of support for Afghan counterrevolutionaries, which was initiated under President Carter, has become an overt policy of the United States Government.\n315.\tUnited States intervention in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is growing and intensifying. One can find ample evidence of that, even in the American press.\n316.\tAn article by the Pulitzer prize winner, Carl Bernstein, in the 18 July 1981 issue of The New Republic, sheds some light on the scope of the international imperialist conspiracy against Afghanistan, headed by the United States and also involving China, Pakistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Bernstein writes that President Carter ordered the secret arms supply Program launched in December 1980 and that the Reagan Administration reviewed the clandestine operation and ordered it to be expanded. He also writes that the CIA has coordinated the operation through counterpart intelligence services in the four other countries, that diplomatic channels were not used and that the United States' NATO allies were neither consulted nor asked to participate.\n317.\tHe says that the operation also involved China's permission for overflights of its territory by the aircraft carrying arms to the Afghan resistance fighters. Bernstein goes on to say that the United States has provided financial assistance, $20 million to $30 million to start with and considerably more since. He adds that the entire operation is now estimated to have cost more than $100 million.\n318.\tSo the major and only reason for the tense situation regarding Afghanistan is armed aggression from the outside and other forms of interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan fueled from imperialist and hegemonist quarters. It was that intervention that prompted the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to invite a limited contingent of Soviet troops to help the Afghan army repel the aggression.\n319.\tGuided by the peaceful principles of its foreign policy and a sincere desire to defuse tension in the area and normalize relations with the neighboring countries, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan put forward, in May 1980, a realistic Program for a political settlement of the situation concerning Afghanistan which is the result of the imperialist policy of intervention and aggression. Less than a month ago the Afghan Government came forward with a new initiative and set forth elaborate proposals to that effect, taking into account the experience accumulated during the contacts with interested parties which had taken place since May 19.80.\n320.\tThe statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan of 24 August has been distributed as an official document [AI36I457, annex], and ,1 shall be brief in explaining some of its major ideas.\n321.\tReaffirming its readiness to hold direct negotiations with the Governments of Pakistan and Iran to normalize relations with them, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan proposes either that such negotiations be conducted on a bilateral basis, which is preferable and more promising, or, if the Governments of Pakistan and Iran insist, to have trilateral negotiations. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan does not object to these negotiations, whether bilateral or trilateral, being attended by the United Nations SecretaryGeneral or his representative.\n322.\tWe are also of the opinion that reliable international guarantees of agreements reached as a result of such negotiations with regard to the cessation and the non-resumption of armed and other interference in Afghanistan's affairs must be an integral part of a political settlement. We agree that the discussion pertaining to working out such guarantees and determining which countries would be guarantors be started simultaneously with and conducted parallel with bilateral or trilateral negotiations among Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.\n323.\tThe achievement of a political settlement, including working out international guarantees, will also give an opportunity to determine by agreement between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union the timetable of the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The pullout of troops would be contingent on the progress in implementing the agreements reached; it would be conducted stage by stage.\n324.\tThe delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has been authorized to start direct bilateral or trilateral negotiations with the delegations of Pakistan and Iran on the basis of the ideas I have just outlined. We are ready to discuss the ways and means of a political settlement of the situation concerning Afghanistan here and now, during the current session of the General Assembly. I call upon the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan and Iran to get down to the negotiating table and start discussion on the issues of mutual interest without further delay. I also invite the SecretaryGeneral, or his representative, to be present at these* talks.\n325.\tThere have been some references to the proposal of the Council of Ministers of the European Community concerning the so-called international conference on Afghanistan. This proposal has never been conveyed to us officially, but the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has already stated that it is unrealistic and totally unacceptable to Afghanistan. It is unacceptable because it constitutes yet another attempt to violate the sovereign rights of the Afghan people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and to interfere in its domestic affairs. Matters concerning the existing regime in Afghanistan, and the composition of its Government, as well as other internal issues, are not to be discussed at any international forum. These matters are being solved and will be solved in the future only by the Afghan people and not by anybody else. Besides, nobody has the right to discuss the problems pertaining to the sovereign rights and national interests of Afghanistan, including the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, without the participation of the legal and authentic representatives of the Afghan people, namely, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.\n326.\tThese are the main points I wanted to make on the problems concerning the maintenance of peace and security in Asia, including the area of SouthWest Asia, and on the ways and means of eliminating hotbeds of tension in this part of the globe. We are optimists, and we are confident that the will of the peoples, and their desire for peace and good-neighborly relations, will eventually prevail over the adventurous aggressive ambitions and schemes of imperialism and hegemonism, and that Asia will become a continent of peace, tranquility and mutually beneficial cooperation.\n327.\tNow let me dwell upon certain other international issues which are of special concern to the developing countries.\n328.\tThe paramount problem is the problem of curbing the arms race, particularly the nuclear arms race, which now constitutes a threat to the very existence of the human race. It is totally unacceptable that more than $500 billion should be squandered annually for military purposes, while the most acute problems of the developing countries remain unresolved.\n329.\tThere is no more important role than that of forestalling the nuclear confrontation which may wipe out hundreds of millions of human lives. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan therefore fully supports the proposal put forward at the preceding meeting from this rostrum by Andrei Gromyko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, that a declaration should be adopted by the Assembly, on behalf of all Member States, solemnly proclaiming that any States and statesmen who were the first to use nuclear weapons would be committing the gravest crime against humanity. This is a simple and straightforward idea, appealing to the people of all continents and all countries, but its adoption will also be a decisive step in the direction of preventing a nuclear disaster and a reliable barrier in the path of those who contemplate such plans.\n330.\tThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan also fully supports the proposal of the Soviet Union at the preceding meeting to stop the production of nuclear weapons and reduce the stockpiles of such weapons with a view to their complete destruction. We know that in 1979 this proposal was conveyed to the Committee on Disarmament but discussion of this vital problem is being blocked by China and some Western countries. We feel that the Assembly should call on the Committee on Disarmament to expedite the practical discussion of this issue.\n331.\tNegotiations on some other aspects of checking the nuclear arms race should also be speed up. We note with great satisfaction the readiness of the Soviet Union to continue talks with the United States on the qualitative and quantitative limitation of strategic nuclear arms. We think the Assembly should urge the United States to take a more positive stand on this vitally important issue.\n332.\tAfghanistan is in favor of resumption at the earliest moment of talks between the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom on banning nuclear weapons tests. We also support the idea of creating a special working group within the Committee on Disarmament to help resolve the problem. The threat of a nuclear holocaust would be somewhat lessened if an international convention were signed aimed at strengthening the guarantees of the security of those States which do not have such weapons in their territories.\n333.\tThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan welcomes initiatives aimed at preventing the use of outer space for military purposes and promoting international peaceful cooperation in space. Therefore, we fully support the proposal of the Soviet Union to work out a treaty banning the placement in outer space of weapons of \\\"any kind. Such a treaty would be a reliable barrier to the arms race in outer space, which could have unpredictable consequences.\n334.\tIt is also necessary to expedite the negotiations on a comprehensive agreement banning new kinds and new systems of weapons of mass destruction, as well as on agreements and conventions outlawing certain weapons, particularly neutron, radiological and chemical weapons.\n335.\tAs a developing country, Afghanistan regrets that until now no progress has been achieved with regard to reaching an agreement on the reduction of the military budgets of States. Such an agreement would have released funds that are so much needed by the developing countries, particularly the least developed among them, such as Afghanistan.\n336.\tWe feel that all these problems and many others can be fruitfully and constructively discussed and resolved at the second special United Nations General Assembly session on disarmament scheduled for 1982, and at the proposed world disarmament conference. Now that it is generally recognized that the international situation has dangerously deteriorated, it is more important than ever to work out and conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. We call upon the Special Committee on Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of NonUse of Force in International Relations to speed up the work on the relevant draft.\n337.\tThe delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is of the opinion that at its current session the General Assembly has to take most effective measures to eliminate the last vestiges of colonialism, racism and apartheid. All the United Nations Member States should totally and fully comply with the provisions of the Plan of Action for the Rill Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [General Assembly resolution 35/118, annex],\n338.\tThis is particularly important since during the last few weeks the world has witnessed insolent and arrogant attempts by certain Western countries to revive the worst practices of the colonialist imperialist diktat and to suppress the peoples fighting for their freedom.\n339.\tThe highhanded bloody tactics of the Pretoria regime, which not only brutally suppresses the indigenous population of South Africa and Namibia but commits acts of aggression against independent sovereign States, are a clearcut demonstration of such arrogance and insolence. The outrageous behavior of Pretoria would have been impossible if it had not been supported and armed by certain Western Powers, particularly the United States. The Pretoria regime and the so-called contact group of the five countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in violation of the well-known decisions of the United Nations, particularly resolution 435 (1978) of the Security Council, are trying hard to install in Namibia a puppet government and deprive SWAPO of its legitimate role in shaping the future of that Territory.\n340.\tThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan resolutely condemns these neo-colonialist maneuvers by the Western Powers and Pretoria. We are in favor of real independence for Namibia and the transfer of power without any further delay to SWAPO, which is the only legitimate, authentic representative of the Namibian people, recognized by the United Nations and the QAU.\n341.\tAfghanistan supports the demand for the most effective and stringent sanctions against Pretoria as provided for in Chapter VU of the Charter. We are also for strict compliance with the sanctions against the apartheid regime already imposed by the Security Council. We resolutely condemn the armed aggression of Pretoria against Angola and strongly deplore the recent United States veto of a Security Council resolution censoring Pretoria for this aggression. Our solidarity is with our fraternal Angolan people defending their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Afghan delegation voted in favor of the resolutions adopted at the special session of the General Assembly on Namibia and is in favor of the speediest implementation of these resolutions.\n342.\tWe support the people of Western Sahara, who are\nstruggling for their self-determination and independence.\n\n343.\tThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan condemns the outburst of colonialism in other parts of the world as well. We are against the dismemberment and annexation of the Trust Territory of Micronesia which was carried out by the United States in total disregard of its duties as the administering Power, and in violation of the Charter.\n344.\tAfghanistan stands for the preservation of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and strict respect for its policy of non alignment. In our view the real settlement of the Cyprus question can be achieved only if due account is taken of the interests of both communities, and we support the continuation of the negotiations between them.\n345.\tThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan condemns the United States for meddling in the internal affairs of Latin America and the Caribbean countries, for its armed provocations against Cuba and Nicaragua, and its attempts to destabilize the situation in Grenada. We express our solidarity with the heroic struggle of the people of El Salvador led by the Farabundo Marti Front against the Fascist dictatorship. We are on (the side of the gallant people of Chile in its staunch resistance to the military regime.\n346.\tPeace and stability in their true meaning would not be achieved without bringing fundamental changes in the existing economic system. These changes must result in a situation that will furnish more opportunity to the developing countries whose economies have been deteriorating or on the verge of collapse.\n347.\tThe aim of the new international economic order is to establish a new economic system based on justice and equity so that there will be less of a gap between the rich and poor. The plight of the least developed countries, especially the land-locked countries, is of particular concern to Afghanistan. The geographical disadvantage of these countries has seriously affected their trade by imposing additional costs of transport, transit and transshipment.\n348.\tDue to the concerted efforts of the landlocked developing countries, the General Assembly established a Special Fund for these countries [resolutions 3504 (XXX) and 31/177]. The main purpose in establishing this Special Fund was to assist landlocked countries to achieve a higher rate of growth despite their geographical handicaps, and particularly to reduce, as much as possible, the excessive and additional transit and transport costs which they face. Unfortunately, this fund has not yet become fully operational. It is more imperative than ever to mitigate the ever increasing economic problems of these countries.\n349.\tAs one of the least developed countries, Afghanistan actively participated in the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris. Unfortunately, the hopes entertained by some of the countries of this group were somehow dashed because the Western capitalist States refused to undertake obligations which would make it possible to fulfill the targets defined by the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [General Assembly resolution 35/56, annex] with regard to the least developed countries.\n350.\tAfghanistan, however, welcomes the positive and constructive approach to the problems of the least developed countries taken at the Paris conference by the socialist countries. We are also satisfied with the all-around economic and technical cooperation between the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the countries of the socialist community, particularly the Soviet Union. This cooperation is based on the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit. It is an important factor contributing to economic and social progress in Afghanistan.\n351.\tThe conscience of the world calls more than ever before for action to eliminate poverty, hunger and underdevelopment. Equality can never be claimed while there is hunger beside waste, poverty beside abundance, and a difference of opinion on the definition of equity and equality.\n352.\tIn the present tense international situation the United Nations is called upon to play a much more effective role in working out arrangements which could help preserve peace and maintain international security. We feel that the Charter has not yet been fully used in this respect as an instrument of peace. For this reason Afghanistan supports the Soviet proposal 22 to convene a special series of meetings of the Security Council with the participation of State leaders in order to search for ways to improve the world political climate.\n353.\tWe feel that it is important to make more effective and constructive use of the Charter in its present form.\n354.\tIn conclusion, let me express the hope that the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly will be a momentous event in the efforts of peace-loving peoples of the world to avert the danger of a nuclear war and preserve peace for the present and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "200.\t The thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly has opened in an atmosphere of expectation and hope. We are reminded that at the thirty-fifth session the study of certain important questions, whose satisfactory solution could have beneficial effects on international peace and security, yielded blueprints and approaches that gave rise to great hope. They include the question of Namibia, the problem of the Middle East, the situation in Asia, the NorthSouth dialog and the negotiations on the law of the sea. While all of them were not resolved during the last session, we still hope that at the current session and under the wise and enlightened presidency of Mr. Kittani, progress will be made along the lines desired by the international community.\n201.\tTo attain those objectives, the Assembly will once more have need of a President who is both a statesman and a diplomat. Those two qualities are combined in Mr. Kittani. We would therefore like to express the pleasure and satisfaction with which we see him accede to his high position. Added to this is the fact that his country, Iraq, and my country, Senegal, enjoy exemplary and special relations. In extending to him my country's sincere and heartfelt congratulations along with its best wishes for success, I can assure him of the full cooperation of the delegation of Senegal throughout the work of this session.\n202.\tI should like to take this opportunity to express my country's gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, for his highly personal contribution, as an experienced diplomat, to the success of our last session.\n203.\tI should like finally to pay a tribute to the work of the SecretaryGeneral and to his tireless efforts in the discharge of his sensitive functions.\n204.\tIn hailing the admission of Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu, I should like to wish them welcome and to assure them that my country's Government is prepared to establish with these two new Members of the Organization relations of friendship and fruitful cooperation.\n205.\tWe are meeting once again to review the year which is coming to an end and together to try to define in relation to the past and to the future a future already burdened with unknown factors and uncertainty the most appropriate ways and means to establish a world which is just because it is based on tolerance, mutual understanding and solidarity.\n206.\tSince last autumn, the endless conflicts which have colored relations among some Member States have undergone developments which are disquieting for humanity, even if in a few rare cases glimpses of a positive solution have been momentarily perceived. Thus, southern Africa, the Middle East and Asia continue to harbor hotbeds of serious tension which, at any moment, could flare up into conflagrations with unforeseeable consequences.\n207.\tUpheavals and dangers of all kinds continue seriously to jeopardize the futures of several peoples of those regions, peoples which aspire to exercise their legitimate right to self-determination. The same dangers today, threaten the consolidation of the independence of young States, as well as their stability and development. I shall try to pinpoint some of these upheavals and dangers, to recall whenever necessary my Government's position on those questions, and to voice some suggestions which, in the eyes of my country, might facilitate their solution.\n208 The eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, devoted to the important question of Namibia, provided an opportunity for my country, Senegal, to reaffirm its position on that problem which, once again, poses a grave threat to international peace and security. If I return to that point, it is to recall certain principles, the implementation of which would help restore cooperation and stability in that region. I am talking about scrupulous implementation of the settlement plan of the Western countries, endorsed by Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It cannot be overemphasized that that resolution is an honorable compromise; its adoption gave rise to great hopes and allowed the appearance on the horizon of the prospect of a just settlement of this problem, which is of such concern to the international community. My country welcomes the statements made this session by other delegations, in particular those of the Western countries which sponsored that resolution and are eager for its complete implementation as soon as possible. In this regard, we should emphasize the fact that the meeting of the five-country contact group showed a determination to pursue efforts aimed at the implementation of the Security Council resolution. Those countries deserve encouragement and support in the course they are pursuing.\n209.\tIf South Africa were to persist in its dilatory tactics and thus to overtax the patience of the international community, there would be no alternative to the adoption of enforcement measures against it which would compel it to abide by the decisions of the Organization. As we said a few weeks ago, those measures are, essentially, first, to put an end to all military and nuclear cooperation with South Africa in accordance with Security Council resolution 418 (1977); secondly, to impose an effective embargo against it, especially an oil embargo; thirdly, no longer to make investments in it or to grant it loans; fourthly, to put an end to the purchase and marketing of gold and other minerals from South Africa and to cooperation with South African bodies which market those minerals; fifthly, to deny to South Africa certain essential supplies, inter alia, electronic and telecommunications material, machinery and chemical products, as well as transfer of technology.\n210.\tIt should be recalled that those measures were advocated by the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, held in Paris from 20 to 27 May 1981, over which my country, Senegal, had the honor to preside, because South Africa has created a dangerous and explosive situation throughout southern Africa. Those measures could be effective because the South African economy which is, as is known, heavily dependent on foreign countries in the areas of technology, financing, capital goods and oil would feel sorely the effects of binding, specific international sanctions.\n211.\tMy delegation would like here solemnly to renew the support of the people and the Government of Senegal for the fraternal people of Namibia, organized under the aegis of SWAPO, its sole authentic representative under the leadership of its President, our brother Mr. Sam Nu-joma.\n212.\tThe odious system of apartheid practiced by the South African Government, besides the challenge it constitutes to our devotion to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is more than a mere attack on African human dignity, it is a crime against humanity.\n213.\tSouth Africa's repeated attacks against the front-line States, and especially against the sovereign people of Angola, must once again be condemned here. In this regard, Senegal would like once more to express its support for Angola.\n214.\tThe Organization must therefore meet this challenge, and to do this, the conclusions adopted at the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa should be endorsed by the General Assembly during this session. We think that those conclusions constitute the most effective and also the most appropriate way to compel South Africa to end the system of apartheid. I should also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm solemnly here the steadfast determination of the Government and the people of Senegal to continue to offer their aid and assistance to the two South African national liberation movements, the African National Congress of South Africa and the Rmi Africanist Congress of Azania.\n215.\tOf course, other important political questions also concern my Government.\n216.\tIn the case of Western Sahara, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, at its eighteenth ordinary session held at Nairobi on 27 and 28 June 1981, added a new dimension to the conflict. Senegal, which already at Freetown in 1980 was advocating a \\\"dynamic African style compromise\\\", would like to commend the agreement reached at Nairobi which, we very much hope, will put a prompt end to this conflict in the interest of all States of the region, as well as of Africa as a whole.\n217.\tAs regards the Comoran island of Mayotte, we would like to believe that the dialog that has been opened between the French authorities and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros will continue and be strengthened. Senegal is available to the parties to help them in this connection.\n218.\tThe question of Chad has been distinguished this year by two events, the installation of the Transitional National Union Government and the acceptance of the principle of the dispatch of a pan-African force to Chad, the membership of which will be subject to approval by the Transitional National Union Government. We hope that the measures decided upon by the OAU at Nairobi will lead to the establishment of a lasting peace in a united and truly independent Chad, to the benefit of its people as a whole.\n219.\tThe conflict in the Middle East, because of its growing complexity and its many implications, remains today one of our most serious problems, requiring the close attention not only of that region but of the international community as a whole. Since December 1967, the resolutions and decisions of the Organization aimed at defining and organizing the framework for a just and lasting solution to that conflict have multiplied. Indeed, for more than a quarter of a century this question has been constantly under discussion within the United Nations, which has recognized that the resolution of this problem depends upon the implementation of a comprehensive and balanced approach that takes into account some of the fundamental principles of the Organization.\n220.\tI need not remind you that the conditions involve the withdrawal by Israel from Arab and Palestinian territories occupied by force since 1967, the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State in their own homeland, and the recognition of and respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the States in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.\n221.\tMy country is convinced that these principles define just and valid bases for negotiations between all the parties concerned, in particular our brother people of Palestine through its sole legitimate representative, the PLO, led by our brother, Mr. Yasser Arafat. Of course, the great majority of States in the Organization adhere to this position. Nevertheless, Israel's intransigence remains the principal obstacle to the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the area.\n222.\tIndeed, by refusing to evacuate the territories it has occupied by force, by pursuing its policy of systematic annexation, by the establishment of settlements and the judaization of those territories and by continuing to deny the Palestinian reality, Israel is undeniably invalidating its claim that it wishes to live in peace with its neighbors.\n223.\tWe feel it is the duty of the Security Council to take all necessary steps to check this constant deterioration of the situation, particularly in the occupied territories, by calling upon Israel to put an immediate end to its acts of aggression, which are a violation of the permanent principles of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations.\n224.\tIn this connection, my country, under its mandate from the Twelfth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers, held at Baghdad from 1 to 5 June 1981, must take this opportunity to appeal to the members of the Security Council to adopt a new resolution that would explicitly mention the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, whose aspirations are not completely reflected in Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n225.\tMy delegation must once again condemn the Israeli act of aggression against the Tamuz nuclear power station in Iraq. This act of aggression was aimed, among other things, at robbing a State of its sovereign and legitimate right to acquire nuclear technology.\n226.\tThe Government and people of Senegal are increasingly concerned by the situation prevailing in Lebanti. Senegal would like to reaffirm here its unswerving solidarity with Lebanon and to condemn Israel's acts of aggression, acts which frustrate the work of UNIFIL, to which my country has contributed.\n227.\tSenegal would like to reiterate, as it did at the thirty-fifth session [20th meeting], its proposal for the elaboration of a system of safeguards and immunities for the troops made available to the United Nations for peacekeeping operations, so that such forces can carry out their mission effectively. The Lebanese people are a martyred people on whom war and genocide in no way justified by its geographical situation have been inflicted. And if today the Lebanese people have not yet been crushed by force of arms, it is because throughout their history they have always been able to face the injustices of fate with courage. For all these reasons, we appeal to all Lebanese parties and call upon them to turn resolutely towards national reconciliation in order to safeguard both the unity and the sovereignty of their country.\n228.\tI should like to say a few words about the painful conflict between Iran and Iraq. In this respect, the international community should show greater persistence, taking new initiatives and intensifying the efforts already undertaken under various auspices, in order to induce the two belligerent parties to settle the differences between them by peaceful means within the framework of a comprehensive, just and honorable settlement.\n229.\tThe Islamic peace committee, of which Senegal is a member, which was established at Taif in January 1981, as well as the mediation committee of the nonaligned movement, have taken commendable initiatives in this connection, which the international community should encourage, aimed at ending a conflict with manifold consequences for international security.\n230.\tThe seriousness of the situation in the Middle East should not cause us to forget that, in other parts of the world, foreign interference and interventions and violations of the independence and sovereignty of States are contributing to the creation of unacceptable situations, unacceptable in terms both of morality and of law. Thus, in Cambodia and in Afghanistan, Governments have been set up by external Powers in defiance of the Charter and of the principles of the Organization. The United Nations has constantly underscored the injustice of the fate of the peoples of Cambodia and Afghanistan, who desire to live in peace, justice and unity.\n231.\tThese situations, which my country has frequently had occasion to deplore, should, because of their illegitimate nature and the disastrous consequences they entail for relations among States, lead the international community to take the necessary steps to combat the introduction and strengthening of the tendency to violate the fundamental principle of respect for the sovereignty of States laid down in the Charter.\n232.\tIn the case of Kampuchea, by adopting resolution 35/6, the General Assembly recommended, among other things, the withdrawal from Kampuchea of all foreign forces and the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Kampuchean people. We are obliged to state that, despite the efforts of the United Nations, there seems to be little hope of a solution to the Kampuchean problem. For its part, Senegal would like to express its determination to continue to support the Kampuchean people and its authentic representatives until the triumph of justice, the sole object of their sacred struggle. At the same time, my Government thinks that the United Nations should take a new initiative to create an atmosphere favorable to. a peaceful solution to this problem. In this spirit, it is pleasing to note that the international Conference on Kampuchea, which was convened by the Assembly on this question and which met from 13\\\" to 17 July 1981 at Headquarters, defined a realistic framework for the settlement: withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea and the organization off. free elections under international control. There can be no doubt that the implementation of those measures presupposes the consent of all the parties concerned in the conflict. It is time that they all understood that the path of negotiation is the only one which can ensure the success of their arguments and spare their dignity.\n233.\tIn this respect, my country believes that the Ad Hoc Committee set up by the Conference could, with the aid and support of all the parties concerned, help to restore peace and understanding in the country.\n234.\tThe question of Korea also deserves our attention. The principle of reunification, accepted by both countries, should be encouraged by the United Nations.\n235.\tThe situation in Afghanistan, which is still an emotional subject and a cause of deep concern to my country, has prompted new interest with the recent initiatives by the European Community concerning the organization of an international conference on the question. Senegal has followed these initiatives with interest, since it seems that they could lead to an acceptable settlement of the situation in Afghanistan, in the name of solidarity among nations and the principles contained in the Charter.\n236.\tThe problem of Cyprus is still on the agenda of the United Nations. We must welcome the real though limited progress that has been made this year in the framework of inter-communal meetings towards finding a just and peaceful solution that will preserve the unity and sovereignty of Cyprus. A tribute is due in this respect to the Turkish and Greek Governments, as well as to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, for the efforts they have constantly made to resolve this question.\n237.\tThe final extinction of hotbeds of tension in order to bring about international peace and security for all States, particularly those of the third world, which are almost all directly involved would do much to establish a favorable climate for disarmament through the marked reduction of the use of military arsenals which such extinction would engender.\n238.\tThe importance which my country attaches to the problem of disarmament is well known, and it is also known that Senegal has also followed and participated actively in the efforts of the community of nations to strengthen international security. As member of a certain number of groups of experts set up by this Assembly among others, that to study institutional aspects of the disarmament process and the group of experts on the relationship between disarmament and development my country has worked to develop the proposals to which I have referred here at previous sessions. In this spirit, I would recall with emphasis my country's belief in the essential need for the denuclearization of third world regions, feeling that this question deserves the highest priority from our Assembly.\n239.\tWhile supporting efforts in connection with generalized disarmament, unfortunately we can only deplore the slowness of negotiations on the implementation of the program of Action on nuclear disarmament [resolution S10/2, sect. III], adopted during the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, in 1978. On this question, which is vital for the future of the world, we small countries can only try to convince the great Powers which hold in their hands the keys to real solutions in this connection. However, it is recognized that the shared destiny of all States of our planet should lead us to show wisdom and political determination. However, we, the representatives of third world countries, which have always been the arena in which armed conflicts have taken place conflicts often provoked, encouraged and maintained by Powers foreign to the regions concerned, thus involving all mankind in the arms race must therefore show all the more zeal in achieving the objectives of disarmament.\n240.\tThis year, once again, the Assembly will consider the implementation of the decisions and recommendations adopted by the General Assembly at its first special session on disarmament, and will hear the report of the Preparatory Committee on the second special session on disarmament, scheduled for next year.\n241.\tDisarmament and the halting of the race towards collective genocide should, we believe, be fundamental concerns, and, in fact, they are. In line with this principle, we must stress the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. Thus, the Government of the Republic of Senegal feels that it is urgently necessary to increase the effectiveness of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes and to... strengthen the peacekeeping capacity of the Organization, even if this means changes in the present structures and amendments to existing texts. In this respect Senegal, which voted during the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly for the resolution on the peaceful settlement of disputes among States [resolution 35/160], continues to follow with great attention the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. We hope that this Committee will be able to work out as speedily as possible a draft declaration on the peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n242.\tAll these questions which are called \\\"fratricidal wars\\\", \\\"the perpetuation of colonial type domination\\\", \\\"the arms race\\\" are dangerously mortgaging the future of international economic relations, already darkened by the parade of poverty and suffering which is the daily lot of the developing countries, the first victims of the crisis of the 1970s.\n243.\tWe in the third world deplore this situation, which is particularly disturbing for the stability of developing countries and for world peace, since it is coupled with the persistence of economic structures which oppress developing countries and have been inherited from the period of the great colonial empires.\n244.\tThe future of mankind might not be so dark, however, if the international community were deliberately to choose new economic options based on justice and solidarity. In this respect, the appeal of the General Assembly for a new international economic order, made during the sixth and seventh special sessions in 1974 and 1975, proved an \\\"unexpected blessing\\\", as has already been stated, since it aroused the awareness of the leaders of the developing countries to the vital need fundamentally to review the notion of development and growth.\n245.\tDeveloping countries must strive to gain acceptance for a more complete definition of development, no longer based primarily on an almost one dimensional vision of progress tied to purely quantitative growth. Development criteria must also, and at the same time, take into account the mastery of scientific and technical data, which requires adequate human as well as financial resources, and respect for the traditional values of developing countries.\n246.\tMy country must ask the Assembly to give consideration to the adoption of a suitable solution to the problem of the United Nations financing system for science and technology for development.\n247.\tIn this respect, Senegal would like once again to appeal to all Powers, whether of the East or the West, to manifest real political will to accept an adequate method of financing through voluntary contributions and the speedy establishment of institutional provisions. All our efforts must be united within the Assembly in order to achieve and bring about the necessary structures, namely, an executive committee and a secretarial These two bodies would be coupled with the intergovernmental committee which already exists. These structures would make possible better financing of scientific and technical activities and the participation of all African States in decisions in this field.\n248.\tWe also believe that the consensus achieved on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade offers a way of recognizing the interdependence of States and of opening the door to international cooperation.\n249.\tThe political will which made possible the consensus on that Strategy should inspire those Member States which prevented the reaching of consensus on procedural aspects of the global negotiations. Certainly the interdependence of the nations represented here calls, at the least, for international cooperation in the interests of all peoples.\n250.\tThe achievement of this new international economic order presupposes a new humanism in other words, a new kind of healthy relationship among the members of the international community. To be sure, the violation of fundamental freedoms is a serious breach of the policy of development and cannot be justified by the requirements of such a policy.\n251.\tHuman rights are an essential dimension of development. Thus, on the proposal of my country, the sixteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, which met at Monrovia in 1979, adopted resolution 115 (XVI) calling for the elaboration of a draft African charter of human and peoples' rights.\n252.\tDakar, capital of Senegal, had the honor of hosting the high-level meeting of African experts which prepared the preliminary draft. Mr Kgba Mbaye, the first President of the Supreme Court of Senegal and Rapporteur of the ministerial conference which prepared the text, declared in submitting it to the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at Nairobi:\n\\\"Our draft, by the balance it strikes between human rights and the rights of peoples, between civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, and between freedoms and duties, bears the imprint of our specific nature.\\\"\n253.\tIn conclusion, I should like to state that on several occasions the Republic of Senegal has already given proof of its devotion to the universal principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations.\n254.\tOur country, together with other nations devoted to safeguarding the values that inspire the destiny of mankind, takes the opportunity offered by the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly solemnly to reaffirm that it will spare no effort to contribute positively to the search for, and implementation of, relevant solutions, to put an end to the various conflicts dividing the world, to lead and assist peoples to tolerate one another, to get along amicably with one another and to cooperate, in a spirit of mutual confidence and respect for each other's interests, culture and civilization, so that they may fulfill their destiny in freedom and peace.\n255.\tIt was this vocation of peoples determined to reach out to others while remaining themselves a vocation which Senegal shares with the countries represented here that our head of State, Mr. Abdou Diouf, on behalf of his African colleagues, at the opening of the OAU Assembly at Nairobi last June, was recalling when he said:\n\\\"Our combat is a shared one, for justice, dignity and the salvation of our peoples.\n\\\"If our ambitions, prospects, programs and situations are to be achieved, there must be unity and solidarity among us. If unity and solidarity are to be achieved, there must be a spirit of tolerance based on the right to differ. And to this end we must settle our disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the charters of the nonaligned movement and the Organization of African Unity.\\\"\n256.\tMay our Assembly, throughout its work, contribute to the achievement of those ideals. The salvation of mankind is at stake.\n"

        "file_text": "66. Mr. President, the Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to congratulate you upon the occasion of your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. That you should have been elected to such high office is sufficient evidence of the Assembly's confidence and knowledge that you are competent to provide the standards and discipline expected for the condieu of the business of the General Assembly. We wish you well during your term of office.\n67.\tThe Government and people of the Commonwealth of Dominica welcome the admission of Belize, our sister nation of the Commonwealth Caribbean, into the United Nations. Now that the legitimate aspirations of the people of Belize to self-determination and independence have been achieved on the basis of full territorial integrity, ,1 wish to register the full and unequivocal support of the Government and people of Dominica for the international call for the preservation of Belize's territorial integrity and for the intensification of efforts to abate tension in that area.\n68.\tWe look forward also to the admission of the State of Antigua and Barbuda during this session. We fully support the application which we expect will be made very soon after 1 November.\n69.\tthirty-six years ago this month, the sovereign countries of the world established the United Nations. At that time the tragic and catastrophic events that took place between 1939 and 1945 were fresh in the minds of the major actors in the international system. The dominant consideration of Member States was, quite legitimately, peacekeeping, so that succeeding generations might be saved from the scourge of war. However, since that time some 100 new nations have joined the United Nations as sovereign independent States.\n70.\tIn the 1970s it became patently manifest that the world economic structure with its inequalities had failed to come to terms in a positive fashion with the changed political structure arising from the emergence of the colonial peoples into politically independent nations. The First United Nations Development Decade had not realized the hope that the more acute problems of the developing countries might disappear through the sharing of the economic growth that the world economy experienced during the 1950s and 1960s. During the course of the early 1970's the developing countries, dissatisfied with the meager results of years of efforts to raise the living conditions of the vast majority of mankind through assistance programs, were forced to adopt new tactics. We read the Charter again and asked the United Nations to look again at its raison d'etre and to seek out the fundamental objectives of the founding fathers that the machinery must be employed for the promotion of the economic development of all peoples. It was now no longer only the scourge of war from which mankind was to be protected, but the scourge of want and poverty.\n71.\tIn 1974, at the initiative of the developing countries, therefore, the General Assembly adopted the Declaration and program of Action on the Establishment of the New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)]. In the Declaration, the States Members of the United Nations solemnly proclaimed their determination to work urgently for \\\"the establishment of a new international economic order based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and cooperation among all States, irrespective of their economic and social systems which shall correct inequalities and redress existing injustices, make it possible to eliminate the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries and ensure steadily accelerating economic and social development and peace and justice for present and future generations\\\".\n72.\tEssentially the proposals for the new international economic order emphasized the following: the economic development of the developing nations cannot be accomplished without fundamental basic changes in the structure of the international economic system; the prices of the commodities exported to developing countries must be stabilized at just and remunerative levels; better access to markets for manufactured goods should be assured; industry should be developed and diversified, and to that end, access to technology should be provided on favorable terms; and development assistance should be provided in increased volume and on better terms.\n73.\tAlthough the resolution expressing support for the concepts of the new international economic order was adopted by an overwhelming majority at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, I would be less than candid if I did not state that the countries of the North have never fully accepted the details of the proposed reform program and have stalled the discussions a critical junctures, giving ground only when the original proposal had been gradually negotiated into something quite different from that which the South had begun, or when they still retained firm control over the institutions and policies at issue.\n74.\tThat attitude, therefore, forces us to place on the agenda the vital question: are the developed countries really committed to the emergence of a new international economic order, and does the political will exist to make that new international economic order operate effectively within a time-frame that will satisfy the reasonable expectations of the mass of mankind? It is particularly crucial that the situation of non-oil-producing developing countries, which have within their ranks the less-developed countries of the world, be immediately recognized, with a view to ameliorating their relative positions.\n75.\tThe non-oil-producing developing countries are finding themselves in the unenviable position of having to deal with three different types of external shock at the same time. All these forms of external shock have a negative impact on their economies. Those countries face an increased oil import bill and the increasing cost of industrial goods. Developing non-oil-producing countries must also face the resultant effects of the implementation of stabilization policies in industrial countries which cause rises in nominal and real interest rates in world financial markets. Those countries must also face the effects of a slowdown of industrial activity in industrial countries resulting in a reduction in the demand for imports from the developing countries.\n76.\tGiven their small size, isolation and very narrow and limited resource base \u2014human and material\u2014 the island developing countries are confronted with further severe disadvantages and require a special package of external assistance from the international community. In addition to project financing, on as highly concessional terms as possible, they need program assistance, also on highly concessional terms, to enable them to reorganize and strengthen their fiscal, administrative, management and development planning systems and to meet for a reasonable, though limited, period of time the additional recurrent costs resulting from the execution of those development projects which may not be financially self liquidating.\n77.\tLet me pause here to mention among development projects a particular project which is essential for the existence of my country that of rehabilitation of the road network, without which further development is near impossible.\n78.\tThere is also a need for higher levels of project financing on highly concessional terms, including the transfer of resources for meeting local costs and cost overruns, and the need for even softer terms than hitherto for loan financing. In fact, the Caribbean less developed States need for financing their development projects either capital grants or soft loans on terms as close as possible to those of the International Development Association or of the European Development Fund \\\"special loans\\\", or of the InterAmerican Development Bank terms of soft lending to its most needy group of borrowing countries, which are classified as falling within group D.\n79.\tI am advised that according to certain criteria the Commonwealth of Dominica does not qualify for classification as a least developed country. Among the reasons is that Dominica's gross national product on the records appears too high. There is little comfort in that situation. It only proves that some of our definitions and criteria require to be overhauled from time to time to enable us to get exact meanings. On the one hand, the United Nations is seeking to console us by telling us that we are not among the worst off of the worst off; on the other hand, I myself and all Dominicans know that in terms of our infrastructure and economy we are \\\"least\\\" developed. And if one adds to that the fact that over the past two years nature has not been particularly kind to us, then the social and economic picture of Dominica highlights the fact that we are in need of substantial aid.\n80.\tWe are grateful to the United Nations and the bodies in the United Nations system, including the specialized agencies, for the assistance we have had. The General Assembly in 1980 {adopted resolution 35/102) asking for special attention to be given to the needs of my island. United Nations officials have been looking into this to see in what way and to what extent we can be assisted. May I ask that members remember the scope of the resolution when they are approached to fulfill the wishes expressed therein. May I also ask that this effort be followed by a further resolution of the General Assembly requesting that Dominica be treated as if it were also on the records as a less-developed country.\n81.\tI have indicated how disappointed we are that in spite of the ongoing North-South dialog we are very distant from reaching the goal of a new international economic order. There is a small glimmer of hope, however, in the interest shown by Canada, Mexico, the United States of America and Venezuela in what we have come to know as the Caribbean Basin initiative. In a communique released at the end of a meeting of the foreign ministers of those four countries, which was held at Nassau, we were informed that a consultation should take place between all countries before a program for bilateral or multilateral aid was set up. The machinery is being put in place to allow for that full consultation.\n82.\tThe Commonwealth of Dominica is hopeful that the Caribbean Basin initiative will soon begin to bear fruit for Dominica itself, as indeed for other members of the \\\"Basin\\\", as a first realistic indication that some form of a new international economic order, some new approach to the fact and methodology of economic assistance and development, can in fact work. And if \u2014no, I shall say \\\"when\\\", because I must be optimistic\u2014 the Caribbean Basin initiative approach does work, Dominica's hope is that that approach, in whatever version, will spread throughout the international community and afford mankind a chance of survival and salvation.\n83.\tIt is clear, however, that the Caribbean Basin initiative is firmly based on the principles of expansion of trade, industry and investment opportunities. Important as this initiative will be, we must not forget that, as I pointed out earlier, the less developed Caribbean countries require assistance in the development and reconstruction of their infrastructure so that they will be in a position to partake of the benefits of expanded trade, industry and investment opportunities.\n84.\tThe Prime Minister of Australia put it well when, in discussing the NorthSouth dialog, he referred to the countries of the South as being deeply concerned about their place in the world, their dignity, status and influence.\n85.\tIt is this concern which makes the Government and people of Dominica condemn South Africa's apartheid policy and South Africa's denial of the right of Namibia to self-determination.\n86.\tIt is also this concern which makes us pleased that the International Women's Year was followed by the proclamation of the United Nations Decade for Women.\n87.\tMay I be forgiven if, because of my impatience for achievement, I complain that too much time is being expended on diagnosing the deficiencies in the less developed countries and not enough on the real implementation of an action plan to overcome those deficiencies. Funds are limited and they are for a limited period. Time is against us. I would therefore hesitate to approve of a change of location for the implementation of the Fund which could only result in a disruption of the Fund's activities.\n88.\tIt is also that concern which makes us condemn terrorism and which moves us to urge the General Assembly to enlarge on the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents [resolution 3166 (XXVIII), annex] to cover the other acts of terrorism which have become so prevalent since the Convention was first drafted and to seek appropriate mechanisms for enforcement.\n89.\tWhen I wrote those words regarding terrorism a day or so ago, I could not have visualized that today, within a few hours of my addressing this General Assembly, we would have so vividly illustrated to us the heinousness of terrorism. This is a sad day for as. President Sadat was a man of peace, as his every move unconventional, innovative and proudly conciliating has illustrated. He was a man whom every member of the Assembly must wish to emulate, a man whose life and resolution to find peace Tor his people illustrate the very ideas which created the United Nations.\n90.\tIn these sad hours our thoughts go out to the victims of the attack, to the wife, the family and the friends of President Sadat, to the Egyptian people and to the Government of Egypt. But our thoughts and sympathies must also remain with ourselves, for one of us who had been trying to live up to the ideals in which we all believe has been made to suffer. May his suffering and that of his people entrench us in the firm belief that we must continue to seek the lasting peace which is essential for the future of this world.\n91.\tAnd now that, sadly, it has been officially confirmed that President Sadat is no longer with us, I wish to join with all those who have spoken before me this afternoon in extending, on behalf of the Government and the people of Dominica, sincerest sympathy to his wife, his family, his friends, the Egyptian people and the Government of Egypt. They have lost a great leader.\n92.\tIn conclusion, I should like to return to my earlier theme and quote the words of the President of the United States spoken only a few days ago at the World Bank meeting. He said \\\"Let us put an end to the divisive rhetoric of 'us versus them', North versus South. Instead, let us decide what all of us both developed and developing countries can accomplish together.\\\"\n93.\tWe agree with that interpretation of the idea of the NorthSouth dialog, but we should like to add that where partners are unequal the relationship is not always a happy one. It is for this reason that I urge that we the less developed countries be given the necessary aid so that we can begin to build our countries to the point when we may no longer be aid-seekers, but be placed in a position where we can, together with the developed countries, achieve a better world for all.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I wish to extend to Mr.\nKittani our warmest congratulations on his election and assumption of the office of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His election is undoubtedly a testimony to his outstanding personal qualities, as well as a justly deserved reward for his long, selfless and outstanding contribution to the United Nations, which he has served in various capacities with such distinction for more than two decades. I am fully confident that, under his able and wise guidance, our proceedings at this session will be quite successful. I can assure him, particularly in view of the amity that exists between our two countries, that he can count on my delegation for the fullest possible cooperation in the discharge of his onerous duties and responsibilities.\n274.\t1 should like also to take this opportunity to pay the warmest tribute to the President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, for the able manner in which he guided the proceedings in the past year, when the Assembly was faced with many major issues of war and peace. It is to his credit that during his tenure of office he displayed great personal qualities, a sense of fair play and a complete dedication to the cause of peace in serving the Assembly as President.\n275.\tI should like also to take this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to Vanuatu and also to Belize on their accession to independence and on their admission as the one hundred fifty-fifth and one hundred fifty-sixth Members of the Assembly and the comity of nations. With their admission, we are now nearer our dream of attaining the universality of the United Nations.\n276.\tI believe that we also owe our SecretaryGeneral much gratitude for his dedication to duty and his unfailing concern for the welfare and good health of the Organization. At no time have these sterling qualities served the United Nations better than in the past few years, when the international system has suffered considerable strains and tensions.\n277.\tIt is with great concern that my country and delegation view the general deterioration in the international situation since last year. On many of the prevailing global issues, we are no nearer to a solution. In several cases the prospects for resolving the problems are actually dimmer. Our willingness and capacity for the resolution of the major problems which now plague the world seem to have diminished considerably, despite the fact that here in the Assembly and within the United Nations system we have all devoted considerable time and energy to our common search for a durable solution to the strains and tensions in the international situation. Yet the need for a peaceful resolution of these problems has never been greater or more urgent, in view of the great danger to international peace and security engendered by these international tensions and strains.\n278.\tMy delegation is particularly concerned about the situation now developing in southern Africa, an issue over which a special session of the Assembly met only two weeks ago. There are three major elements in the situation now evolving in southern Africa, each one of which has the potential for erupting into a major world conflict. First, there is the continued occupation of Namibia by the racist regime of South Africa despite repeated pronouncements by the Assembly and the International Court of\nJustice that such occupation is illegal. There is no need to rehash the several General Assembly resolutions demanding the withdrawal of the racist regime of South Africa from Namibia, nor is it necessary for me to bore the Assembly with details of the efforts that have been made, without any success, to secure the withdrawal of the racist South African regime from that Territory. All this is too well known to require any further elaboration. The SecretaryGeneral has in his annual report also alluded to all the major efforts made by the Organization to secure a peaceful settlement in Namibia, including the United Nations peace plan on Namibia, which the Security Council approved in resolution 435 (1978) and which was unanimously endorsed by the Assembly [resolution ES8/2]. All these activities eventually produced the Geneva meeting at which the racist regime of South Africa behaved in a most irresponsible manner by slamming the door on a negotiated settlement.\n279.\tIt is, therefore, a matter for deep regret that the danger posed to international peace and security by the continuing illegal occupation of Namibia by the racist regime of South Africa is not recognized by some Powers which willfully, and in an arrogant display of power, now openly encourage the racist and illegal regime of South Africa to continue its open defiance of the Organization. We have in recent weeks witnessed the bizarre spectacle of racist South Africa's forces launching a vicious, unprovoked and barbaric attack on the sovereign State of Angola under the pretext of pursuing SWAPO freedom fighters in that country.\n280.\tNo other subject has provided such absurd theatricals this year as has the subject of Namibia's independence; but we are far from amused. We have witnessed otherwise civilized nations cannibalize some of the most sacrosanct tenets of democracy in a desperate effort to make southern Africa safe for exploitation by the West, by the denial of freedom to the people of Namibia. We have witnessed nations that in February 1981 condemned South Africa for its duplicity and disruptive tactics during the Geneva pre-implementation talks veto sanctions resolutions against South Africa two months later in the Security Council in order to save the apartheid regime from economic, cultural and political ostracism. We have seen a leading advocate of a peaceful solution of the problems of Namibia's independence recently veto a Security Council resolution condemning South Africa's criminal invasion of Angola in violation of that nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Indeed, only a few weeks ago, at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, we were witnesses to the callous indifference of a cluster of Western nations which abstained on a consensus resolution that could have enhanced and accelerated Namibia's independence.\n281.\tHowever, these are merely symptoms of the times, an index of the convoluted rationalization of evil by a new breed of leaders of men and nations that has made it possible for otherwise rational beings in so-called civilized nations to agree to coexist with apartheid South Africa, that has enabled the exponents of democratic principles on earth to stifle the buds of freedom in Namibia and that has permitted and rationalized the use of naked aggression against Angola by South Africa, ostensibly as part of the white man's self-imposed burden to expurgate communism from southern Africa. For our part, we reject these tendentious premises, which provide no more than a smokescreen for what is essentially an amoral and materialistic, as well as a racially biased, policy.\n282.\tWe have no illusions about the magnitude of the problems facing us at this session of the General Assembly on the question of Namibia's independence. At the same time, we have no doubts about the consequences of failing to take appropriate measures to meet the challenge which continued South African intransigence poses. At the very least, we feel it necessary to reiterate some eternal principles associated with the Namibian struggle, lest our civility be mistaken for cowardice and our inaction taken for acquiescence.\n283.\tOf the many things with which the world's historical landscape is strewn, the wreck of an abandoned liberation struggle is not one of them. And it is certain that, as night follows day, the struggle for the genuine independence of Namibia, under a democratically elected Government led by SWAPO, will never be abandoned. In plain language, it means that the day will never come when African nations will despair of the struggle for Namibia's independence and cast it adrift as a hostage to South Africa. That would be a gesture of abject surrender and appeasement to which no true African, with the blood of his proud ancestors running through his veins, will ever subscribe. If any proof of this were needed, the recent emergency summit meeting of the front-line States and Nigeria in Lagos should provide ample testimony of the continuing pursuit of the goal of that country's independence. The achievement of that goal remains a cardinal objective of the foreign policy of my country, and we will not relent until victory is won. Indeed, on the issue of Namibia's independence, all African countries are front-line States, and our continental commitment to the achievement of that goal will never waver or falter, come what may, no matter what the price. In this connection, we reiterate our unflinching support for SWAPO and our commitment to the early implementation of the Namibia plan approved by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978) without amendment, modification or amplification.\n284.\tIn recent months, the element of superPower ideological rivalry has been introduced into the already muddy political waters of southern Africa, with a view to confusing the direct and simple issue of the independence of the oppressed in that area. The underlying aim, no doubt, is to provide a pretext for the entrenchment of neocolonialism in that part of our continent through its Achilles' heel. We know that the most strenuous efforts are being made to forge a link between the withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and progress towards Namibia's independence. We see none, and unreservedly repudiate the claims of extra-continental Powers to dictate to any African country who their friends shall be when their national survival is threatened.\n285.\tAs long as South Africa continues its criminal military rampage over the territorial boundaries of sovereign African States, as long as that criminal State continues with its efforts to destabilize Angola, Mozambique and other neighboring States with the active encouragement and support of some Western Powers, so long will Angola and, indeed, every African State which is threatened feel obliged to obtain military assistance from any quarter in order to preserve its sovereignty. The termination of South Africa's presence in Namibia and of its acts of aggression against neighboring African States is an indispensable precondition for the withdrawal of foreign military presence from the affected parts of the region.\n286.\tOnly very recently, the Foreign Minister of that pariah State was alleged to have called for cooperation between his country and Nigeria in the interests of the security, peace and progress of Africa. The racist regime need only pull out its aggressive troops from Angola and other front-line States, cooperate fully with the international community to achieve independence for Namibia and replace the obnoxious apartheid system within its borders with genuine democratic majority rule based on universal adult suffrage. It will then find Nigeria and, indeed, all African States ever willing and ready to extend the right hand of fellowship and to welcome it wholeheartedly into the fold of the OAU.\n287.\tThe multiple crises which have continued to bedevil international .relations reveal one of their worst features in the economic sphere. That the world economy has suffered an alarming deterioration since the Assembly met this time last year is a fact well known to everyone. One has even heard it said by authoritative analysts that mankind may in fact be witnessing now the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. Of course, that is the painful fact of the situation as the prospects for sustained growth and development are seriously constrained by persistent high levels of global inflation, acute payments imbalances, instability of commodity markets, growing protectionism, declining volume of official development assistance, deteriorating terms of trade and unstable exchange rates fueled by an archaic international monetary system.\n288.\tThe cumulative effect of these phenomena has been a drastic slowdown in economic growth for all. countries, particularly the developing countries, most of which have in fact registered negative growth over the last couple of years. One does not have to go far in the search for an explanation for this sorry state of affairs, because the incontestable fact is that our economies have been most particularly vulnerable to the factors enumerated above, which for the most part are of external origin and underscore the question of the structural maladjustment of the international economic system.\n289.\tWe in the developing countries cannot but feel gravely concerned about the extreme severity of the impact of the current global economic crisis on us. The food situation has been particularly critical as many developing countries have resorted to massive food importation, which in turn has aggravated their foreign exchange position with adverse effects on their development process. So also has the very high cost of manufactured and capital goods slowed down the process of industrialization in developing countries, thereby curtailing opportunities for the diversification of their economies so crucial to the attainment of self-reliant development.\n290.\tTo this must be added the consequences of the prevailing instability in the export markets for primary commodities, which has resulted in the steady decline in our export earnings and, indeed, the purchasing power of the unit cost of primary exports. A? contemporary events show, even crude oil has not escaped the fate which raw materials have Additionally been subjected to, as those with their hands on the levers of economic power, namely, the developed market economies, have once more been at the game which they are well equipped to play, thanks to the existing inequitable structure of the international economy.\n291.\tThus, by the most surreptitious strategic maneuvers, as it has done and is still doing with other raw materials, the industrialized North has managed to induce an artificial glut in the world supply for crude oil. My delegation cannot but deplore any strategy which is designed to strangle oil-producing developing countries with the sinister purpose of making energy a non-issue at any resumed global negotiations. We are convinced that the prevailing adverse trends in the world economy must not be allowed to continue, as this can only spell doom for all of us.\n292.\tUrgent solutions are therefore called for. There must be a steady flow of additional financial resources to developing countries, which also need increasing access to technology, in respect of which the developed countries still enjoy a monopoly. These and other requirements are well-accepted prerequisites for the accelerated development of developing countries. Of course, they are clearly underlined in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, the faithful implementation of which we see as a historic responsibility from which the international community, especially the developed countries, cannot afford to shy away.\n293.\tThe moment has been reached when something has to be done about the flagging spirit of multilateral economic cooperation. The hope of peace and plenty which is held forth by our great Organization must not be denied to the vast mass of humanity simply because of the present financial constraints faced by every nation. For many, particularly in the developing countries, the role of the United Nations development system in resource transfer can hardly be underestimated. It is, therefore, important that Member States, particularly the developed countries, should continue to give their full support to the system.\n294.\tIt would be unrealistic, of course, not to acknowledge some encouraging developments which have occurred in the last few months. Happily, the developing countries themselves, which have been hardest hit by the prevailing economic crisis, have not stood still with arms folded. On the contrary, believing in the practical wisdom and the rewards of self-help, representatives of those countries gathered in Caracas in May of this year for the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries. The Program of Action which was adopted on that occasion [see A/36/333] has since become an invaluable instrument for enhancing the collective self-reliance of developing countries, while it also represents their contribution to international economic cooperation for development. We earnestly hope that this noble endeavor of the developing countries will continue to receive the maximum support of the international community, and in particular the United Nations system.\n295.\tRight now attention is being turned to another important international meeting which will take place next month, the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held at Cancun. It is true that this meeting will be held outside the United Nations system, but the potential contribution which it can make to strengthening international economic cooperation will hardly be denied. In any case, my Government hopes that the impending summit meeting will be guided in its deliberations by the sobering realization that a common destiny unites us all and that the objective of the meeting, to provide the needed impetus for the global negotiations, will be achieved.\n296.\tThe international community has waited too long for the global negotiations to get under way. A further delay could be ominous because, as earlier underlined, the world economic crisis is deepening with each passing day. There must be a return to the commitment solemnly made when the Assembly adopted resolution 34/138.\n297.\tIncreasingly, our world is ruled by contradictions and ironies, and nowhere is that more true than in the issue of man's survival. Every year there are ritualistic exhortations in this forum calling for global disarmament. Instead, we are made helpless spectators of accelerated deadly rearmament on a global scale in a sort of geometrical progression. Conversely, the security supposedly guaranteed by this upsurge in armaments buildup proves more elusive in direct proportion to the increase in the armaments stockpile. It is a vicious circle which would be laughable if its consequences were not so deadly serious.\n298.\tHowever, we must point not only to the* great danger of stockpiling those lethal weapons but also to the growing aggressiveness of nations and the ominous new phenomenon of a ready, even eager, disposition to engage in the so-called tactical nuclear warfare. Nuclear warfare was always thought of and regarded as a last resort in the worst type of scenario, unlikely ever to happen because of the existing balance of terror, and the assured destruction capacity of a retaliatory second strike. Now, the new generation of tactical nuclear missiles, with their fiendish capacity for alleged \\\"contained\\\" warfare, makes the early deployment of nuclear weaponry in the event of war a much desired strategy.\n299.\tWe need not, and will not, bow in despair before the awesome might of the nuclear Powers. Rather, we must oblige them to accept and recognize the fact that part of the attributes of sovereignty which every State enjoys is the prerogative to determine the manner in which its citizens can live or die and that any abridgment of that right constitutes a violation of the most fundamental of all human rights the right to live. When some countries decide to embark on a reckless arms buildup, it becomes the legitimate right of other States to express their concern and apprehension. That is why we feel compelled and justified to call upon those who have so obstinately sought to intimidate the rest of mankind with the greatest arms buildup the world has ever known to recognize that the earth is ours too, and that we are unwilling to permit its wanton and mindless destruction. We believe that enough is enough. The United Nations must redouble its effort to bring some sanity to the arms race, but such effort will succeed only to the extent that nations, individually and collectively, decide to turn their swords into ploughshares and release for peaceful development the vast resources at present devoted to missiles.\n300.\tNigeria welcomes the decision to hold the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in 1982, in the expectation that the opportunity will be used to reassess the disarmament postures of\nStates, the status of implementation of the Program of Action adopted during the first special session on disarmament in 1978 [see resolution S1012], the role of the pertinent United Nations organs and the importance of public opinion in disarmament efforts.\n301.\tMay I now draw attention to some of the other flash-points of our troubled world. It is the earnest hope of my country that during this session progress will be made in the relaxation of tensions in the Middle East, through involving the long-suffering Palestinians in a peace process that will ultimately secure for them a homeland of their own, as well as assuring security to the State of Israel. We also hope that this session will see the end of the fratricidal war between Iraq and Iran, two friendly nonaligned nations that need to divert their attention to improving the lot of their people. It is also to be hoped that genuine progress will be achieved in the settlement of the Afghanistan and Kampuchean issues, through the withdrawal of all foreign forces and allowing the peoples of those countries to sort out their international problems peacefully with the help of the United Nations.\n302.\tThe Organization faces today the greatest ever challenge throughout the history of its existence. Whether it be in the political, economic or armament field, our world is on the brink of colossal disaster. A few nations have acquired the capacity to save the world from, or plunge it into, Armageddon. Let us hope that the leaders of those nations will rise above petty, narrow, selfish interests. Let us hope that they will refrain from being the victims of the arrogance of power. Let us hope that the peace, welfare and betterment of the human race as a whole will be their prime concern as it is the concern of all of us as Members of the world Organization. Let us hope that together we will be true and faithful to our great Charter in the interest of peace, prosperity and progress of the whole of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "182.\tMr. President, permit me first of all to express to the General Assembly our profound appreciation for the confidence it has placed in our country, Iraq, by electing you to the presidency of the current session. Iraq, as one of the founding Members of the United Nations, will take this honor as an added impetus, despite the persistent efforts by some Powers in the opposite direction, for the intensification of our efforts towards the achievement of the purposes of the United Nations and the implementation of its principles in such a way as to serve the rights and interests of peoples in freedom, sovereignty, independence and wellbeing.\n183 . I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, for the distinguished efforts he made in presiding over the General Assembly throughout a busy year.\n184.\tI am also pleased to welcome to our midst the States of Vanuatu and Belize, to which I extend, on behalf of the Government and people of Iraq, sincere congratulations on their independence and admission to membership in the United Nations. We wish to convey to the two States our best wishes for their progress and well being.\n185.\tOn 7 June this year American-made military aircraft of the Zionist entity, after violating the airspace of two neighboring Arab States and hence violating their sovereignty and political independence, raided the nuclear installations situated near Baghdad. The raid caused many civilian casualties and much material damage. The authorities of the Zionist entity accepted full responsibility for the raid, which was carried out on the pretext of defending the security of that entity.\n186.\tThe raid constitutes the gravest act of Israeli aggression to date, as it represents a dangerous qualitative turn in the violation of the international norms observed by the international community. If we desire to comprehend the real motives for this Zionist aggression, we must put it in its correct perspective.\n187.\tIt is obvious today that the founders of the Zionist entity had contemplated from the very beginning of their occupation of Palestine the possession of nuclear weapons as a means of intimidating the Arab nation in order to fulfill their plans for Zionist expansion in Arab territories, to create a \\\"Greater Israel\\\" from the Nile to the Euphrates, to impose Zionist hegemony over the whole region and to prevent the rise and progress of the Arab nation along with other nations towards economic development and wellbeing.\n188.\tIn fact, the Israeli nuclear Program goes back to 1949. The most important experiments conducted by the Weizmann Institute in the early 1950s concerned the development of techniques for extracting uranium from phosphates in the Negev as well as others relating to the production of heavy water.\n189.\tIn 1952 the BenGurion Government established the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission within the framework of the Ministry of defense, with a separate budget and special laboratories, which confirms the military objectives of the Israeli nuclear Program from its inception. The existence of that Commission was kept secret until 1954. In 1966 the Commission was reorganized and placed under the direct control of the Prime Minister, who became its chairman.\n190.\tIn 1953 a nuclear cooperation agreement concluded with France marked a turning point in the Israeli nuclear Program. The fact remains, however, that the United States was the first country to provide Israel with a nuclear reactor, under an agreement concluded in 1955, namely, the reactor at Nahal Sorek, south of Tel Aviv, with a capacity of 5 megawatts. This was in addition to providing Israel with a vast library of studies and reports on nuclear science, as well as 6 kilograms of enriched uranium 235, not to mention training 56 Israelis at United States nuclear establishments. Subsequently Israel obtained another United States reactor, with a capacity of 8 megawatts, which was installed at the Technion Institute.\n191.\tOn page 68 of his book entitled Nuclear Arms in the Third World\u2014U.S. Policy Dilemma, published in 1979 by the Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C., Ernest W. Lefever has pointed out that both France and the United States have contributed to Israel's nuclear development.\n192.\tIn 1957 Israel took the decision to build the highly secret reactor at Dimona, in cooperation with France, and in 1958 a reactor with a capacity of 5 megawatts was built at Rishon LeZion in cooperation with the United States. Israeli cooperation in the nuclear field with the Federal Republic of Germany began at the end of the 1950s, through which Israel was provided with an accelerator enabling it to strengthen the department of experimental nuclear physics at the Weizmann Institute. However, Israeli cooperation with the Federal Republic of Germany assumed its official nature only in 1963.\n19?. The Dimona facility remains without any supervision or control and is operated by the Israeli defense Ministry. The most striking fact about the Dimona reactor is that the truth about it was not disclosed until the United States Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] revealed in 1960 that the installation at Dimona, which the Americans were told by Israel was a textile factory, was in fact a nuclear reactor. Subsequently, Israel and France acknowledged this fact. The New York Times stated on 20 December 1960 that the Dimona reactor was particularly well suited for producing fissionable plutonium used in nuclear bombs. In 1969 a United States team reported that it could not guarantee that there was no weapons-related work at Dimona because it was not permitted to move about freely in the installation. Likewise, a United States Congressional inquiry into Israeli nuclear efforts complained of the lack of any detailed knowledge on the part of the United States of the purposes of research and experiments conducted at the Dimona research facility. In November 1976, 13 United States Senators on a nuclear fact finding tour of the Middle East were barred from the facility.\n194.\tFurthermore, in addition to the reactor, there are large-scale facilities for separating weapons grade plutonium from spent fuel at the Soreq research establishment at Dimona. In an article entitled \\\"Israel's Nuclear Policy\\\" by Lawrence Freedman, contained in the May/June 1975 edition of a periodical called Survival, published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, it was stated that the natural uranium used in the Dimona reactor was obtained from France, Argentina and South Africa. It was also stated that Israel had become capable of producing increasing amounts of uranium from its expanding Utilizer industry and that it would soon pass the limits of self-sufficiency.\n195.\tIt has been well known for some time that the Zionist entity has had a nuclear capability since the 1960s. The Arab Governments have been issuing warnings since 1965 that Israel had obtained the basic technology for manufacturing nuclear weapons and that it might have developed its capabilities for manufacturing such weapons. In 1969, the Buffalo Evening News published on 9 May a Reuters report which had appeared in the West German magazine Der Spiegel, stating that Israel had become the world's sixth nuclear power and possessed six Hiroshima type bombs of 20 kilotons. Lawrence Freedman, whose article I have already referred to, also stated that the President of the Zionist entity, Ephraim Katzir, told a group of scientists on 1 December 1974, \\\"It has always been our intention to develop a nuclear capacity. We now have that capacity.\\\" In another article written by Anthony M. Coidesman entitled \\\"How Much Is Too Much?\\\", published in The Armed Forces Journal International in November 1977, it was stated that Moshe Dayan had said in March 1977, before becoming Foreign Minister, \\\"we have to develop an option for ourselves, that is, an ability to produce nuclear weapons ... we should develop this in addition to and not instead of the conventional weapons we have\\\". Cordesman, who served as Civilian Assistant to Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Ellsworth and as Secretary of the Defense Intelligence Board, continues in his article:\n\\\"These remarks take on an added meaning given press reports of Israeli and South African cooperation in developing nuclear weapons, and that the weapon the South Africans were going to test was Israeli.\\\"\n196.\tIt is worth mentioning that Israel pursued various illegitimate means of developing its nuclear capacity, including piracy and theft. At a conference on a \\\"non nuclear future\\\" held at Salzburg in May 1977, Paul Leventhal, a former staff nuclear weapons expert for a committee of the United States Senate, revealed that 200 tons of natural uranium, enough to build 24 nuclear weapons, which had been placed on a ship that had disappeared nine years before, had ended up in Israel. The uranium had been loaded on to a cargo ship named the Scheersburg A, which had sailed out of Antwerp bound for Genoa, where it never arrived. The cargo of the Scheersburg A was reported to be capable of keeping a Dimon atype reactor operating and producing plutonium for 20 years.\n197.\tShortly after the Salzburg revelation, Norway's former chief prosecutor stated that the Israeli agent Dan Aerbel had admitted taking part in the operation to divert the uranium laden ship. Aerbel was seized in 1974 by the Norwegian authorities with four other members of Mossad, the Israeli secret service, for the killing of a Moroccan national who was mistaken for a Palestinian by the Israeli agents at the Norwegian town of Lillehammer. In the mid-1960s, the American Government discovered the disappearance of 200 pounds of highly enriched uranium, enough to make four atomic bombs, from the factory of the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation at Apollo, Pennsylvania. The New York Times recalled on 27 January 1978 that the United States Department of Energy had made public two previously secret documents indicating that American intelligence agencies believed in 1976 that Israel might have obtained uranium in the mid-1960s from a Government-sponsored nuclear facility at the town of Apollo, Pennsylvania.\n198.\tOn page 65 of his book Nuclear Arms in the Third World\u2014U.S. Policy Dilemma, Lefever says that on 26 January 1978 the CIA released a memorandum dated 4 September 1974 entitled \\\"Prospects for Further Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\\\", which disclosed in its conclusion that Israel had produced atomic weapons. The conclusion was based on the \\\"... Israeli acquisition of large quantities of uranium, partly by clandestine means; the ambiguous nature of Israeli efforts in the field of uranium enrichment; and Israel's large investment in a costly missile system designed to accommodate nuclear warheads.\\\"\n199.\tMoreover, The New York Times of 16 March 1976 reported that the CIA estimated that Israel had 10 to 20 nuclear weapons available for use. A report in Time magazine of 12 April 1976, entitled \\\"How Israel Got, the Bomb\\\", stated that Israel possessed a nuclear arsenal of 13 atomic bombs, assembled, stored and ready to be dropped on enemy forces from especially equipped Kfir and Phantom fighters or Jericho missiles.\n200.\tOn page 301 of the SIPRI Yearbook 1981 of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, it is stated that \\\"Israel, which has been reported to possess several untested nuclear bombs, acquired its nuclear weapon capability due to a reactor supplied by France many years before the NonProliferation Treaty and not covered by international controls, as well as heavy water supplied by Norway.\\\"\n201.\tAs regards a nuclear weapons delivery system, it is certain that the Zionist entity has not ignored this. In addition to what I have already mentioned, the International Institute for Strategic Studies indicates in its Strategic Survey 1974, in Table 6 on page 38, that Israel's nuclear weapons delivery system is represented by the French Mirage III and the American Skyhawk A4 and the Phantom F4. The same report refers to an Israeli Program for missile production relating to nuclear weapons. On page 39 it states that \\\"in the 1960s the Marcel Dassault Aircraft Corporation in France developed the MD660 missile, reportedly both nuclear and conventional capable, of which some 24 were believed to be produced and some of these delivered to Israel. It is on this basis that Israel has reportedly developed the Jericho, a surface to surface missile capable of carrying a warhead of 1,000 1,500 lb over a 280 mile range: this missile is believed to be in production.\\\" That information has also been reaffirmed in the article on \\\"Israel's Nuclear Policy\\\", to which I have already referred. Lefever also states, on page 70 of his book, that: \\\"The Jericho, which was developed in Israel with French cooperation, could reach Cairo, Alexandria, the Suez Canal, Damascus, and Amman from launching sites within the pre-1967 borders of the country . . . Several Israeli planes could deliver nuclear bombs to Baghdad.\\\"\n202.\tAlthough the Zionist aggression against the nuclear installations in Iraq falls within the framework of the Zionist acts of premeditated aggression against the Arab nations and the people of Palestine, it is qualitatively distinct from the inhuman practices employed by the Zionists since the beginning of their illegal colonization of Palestine and of occupied Arab territories. The Zionists usurped Palestine in response to the strategic interests of the Zionist movement and world colonialism, which are based on exploitation and dictating the destinies of other people and plundering their riches.\n203.\tSince the Balfour Declaration of 2 November 1917,7 Zionism has usurped Arab territories and possessions by force and terrorism. Since its establishment in Palestine in 1948, the Zionist entity has been embraced by those in colonial quarters who see it as their advance base of aggression for the purpose of wielding hegemony and influence in the Arab world. They have provided the Zionist entity with extensive political, economic, and military support. They have installed in it an arsenal of sophisticated weapons and encouraged it to launch repeated acts of aggression against the Arab nation, beginning in 1948 and followed by the tripartite aggression against Egypt in 1956, the war of 5 June 1967 and the present war against Lebanon and the Palestinian resistance movements. In all those acts of aggression the Zionist entity occupied more Arab territories and sought to impose surrender on the Arabs. World imperialism, especially American imperialism, has always been anxious to preserve its strategic alliance with that racial entity, a major alliance throughout the course of Israel's terroristic, aggressive and expansionist evolution.\n204.\tAlthough the Arab nation does not bear any responsibility for the persecution of the Jews, the great Powers made it pay the penalty for that persecution. They detached by force a part of Palestine, expandable according to the wishes of the Zionist entity, in order to establish there the \\\"State of Israel\\\". If the Zionist entity pretended to the world that it was peaceful and desired nothing but recognition by the Arabs and permission to live in peace and security within the borders of the land usurped from Palestine, that pretension was proved false after the 1967 aggression. It has become clear that the Zionist entity is, in its very nature and objectives, an aggressive and expansionist one, since it has occupied the whole of Palestine, Sinai in Egypt and the Golan Heights in Syria. Since that aggression that entity has imposed by force and blackmail a special theory of security that is most odd and contrary to all norms and traditions of international life. The Zionist entity continues to commit aggression against the Arab States on the pretext of assuring its security. It has expanded in Arab territories, building colonial settlements, and has committed the ugliest crimes against peaceful towns and villages, including the killing of women and children. The Zionist aggression against Iraq, which is not a neighbor of the Zionist entity, has been based on the theory that it has the right to strike and commit aggression everywhere in Arab territories on the pretext of protecting its own security. The Zionist entity has not been satisfied with that; it has gone to the length of committing the crime of murder against the Iraqi and other Arab scientists who have been assassinated in some European capitals during past years and this year.\n205.\tThe Arab nation has no illusions about the nature and intentions of the Zionist entity. The slogan adopted by the Zionists* \\\"From the Nile to the Euphrates\\\", for the frontier of the State of Israel represents the real Zionist strategy. Israel's firm objective is aggression, expansion, and the imposition of its control by blackmail on the whole region to prevent its peoples from achieving liberation and progress. If there were ever any doubt as to that, Israel's aggressive and expansionist policies from the 1967 aggression to its aggression against Iraq and Lebanon have removed all doubts and exposed all these facts clearly.\n206.\tZionism from the beginning envisaged the seizure of the whole territory of Palestine. In his writings in the yearbooks of the Zionist entity for 1952 and 1953, Ben Gurion emphasized that the Jewish State was established in a part of the land of Israel and that that part did not correspond with the historical borders which had been determined and fixed at the beginning of time.\n207.\tAs for Menachem Begin, he said at the time of partition:\n\\\"The Jewish homeland, the area which covers both sides of the Jordan, is a complete historic and geographic entity. Dissection of the homeland is an unlawful act; agreement to dissection is also unlawful, and is not binding on the Jewish people. It is the duty of this generation to return to Jewish sovereignty these parts of the homeland which were torn off from it and given to foreign rule.\\\"8\nIt appears from this that Begin will not be satisfied by holding the West Bank and annexing it to the Zionist entity, but also intends to annex Jordan in the next step in the Zionist expansion plan. It is worthy of mention that Begin stated in the Knesset on 12 October 1955: \\\"I deeply believe in launching a preventive war against the Arab States without further hesitation. \\\"By doing so, we will achieve two targets: first, the annihilation of Arab power; and secondly, the expansion of our territory.\\\" Now that Begin has returned to power and has appointed Ariel Sharon as his Minister for defense, he will no doubt carry out more of this policy.\n208.\tThere is no difference between the Likud and any other Zionist party regarding the Zionist ambitions in Arab territories. Moshe Dayan, for instance, said after the 1967 aggression:\n\\\"Our fathers had reached the frontiers which were recognized in the Partition Plan. Our generation reached the frontiers of 1949. Now the SixDay generation have managed to reach Suez, Jordan and the Golan Heights. This is not the end. After the present ceasefire lines there will be new ones. They will extend beyond Jordan perhaps to Lebanon and perhaps to central Syria as well.\\\"\nThat was quoted in The Times of London of 25 June 1969. Could there be a more blatant pronouncement of Zionist expansionist plans? Could any politician in any other country in the world issue such a statement, which represents the peak of insolence, and the world remain silent? What is worse is that Dayan is now considered a moderate Zionist compared with Begin and Sharon.\n209.\tThe racism of the Zionist entity is evident in the Zionists' view of the Palestinians and their treatment of them in order to evict them from their homeland and establish a purely Jewish State. The Zionist historian, Michael BarZohar, wrote:\n\\\"BenGurion remained skeptical about any possibility of coexistence with the Arabs. The fewer there were living within the frontiers of the new Jewish State the better he would like it ... a major offensive against the Arabs would not only break up their attacks but would also greatly reduce the percentage of Arabs in the population of the new state. (While this might be called racialism, the whole Zionist movement actually was based on the principle of a purely Jewish community in Palestine . . . )\\\".9\n210.\tThe most revealing evidence regarding the Zionist racist outlook towards the the Palestinian people can be seen from the refusal of Zionist officials to use the word \\\"Palestine\\\". In 1969 Golda Meir contended that there was no such thing as the Palestinian people. It was further contended by her information media and her academic experts that this people belonged, in fact, to southern Syria. While Yitzhak Rabin referred to the Palestinians as the \\\"so-called Palestinians\\\", other Israeli leaders claimed that the Palestinians were, in fact, Jordanians, whose country ought to be Jordan. As for Menachem Begin, he describes Palestinians in occupied Arab territories and within the Zionist entity as the Arabs of \\\"Eretz Israel\\\", considering them the blacks of Israel, to be compared with the blacks in the United States of America. This is in addition the policy aimed at the complete annihilation of the Palestinian people, wherever they may be.\n211.\tThis approach means, in fact, that the Arab nation has to submit to and be at the mercy of the aggressive and, expansionist aims by which the Zionist entity imposes its hegemony upon that nation and thwarts its goal to live in peace and enjoy freedom and progress.\n212.\tThe Israeli theory of security is the most dangerous and aggressive in modern times. It is even more dangerous than fascism and nazism. Those who support the Zionist entity are openly standing for aggression and expansion and encouraging the worst and most dangerous theories, against the interests of mankind and its legitimate rights. If the Europeans thought they had the right to struggle against fascism and nazism by all the means at their command and at whatever cost and sacrifice, so do the Arab people have the right to struggle against zionism by all legitimate mea. and whatever the sacrifices might be. The Arab nation is struggling for freedom, sovereignty and progress and wishes to live in peace on its land and to establish sound and equal relations with other peoples of the world. The Arab nation is fully entitled to struggle for the attainment of these objectives and to define friend and foe on the basis of these sound principles, for the principles of freedom and justice are indivisible.\n213.\tWorld zionism and the Zionist entity, with the support of imperialism, are not the only forces which have sought to expand through aggression at the expense of the Arab nation. Iran and its successive Governments have sought the same objective throughout the centuries. The successive regimes of the Persian State have pursued a policy of expansion at the expense of the rights of Iraq and the Arab nation, particularly in the Arab Gulf region, for those regimes have always considered that region as a sphere of influence and domination. This policy has been expressed in various forms at different times according to the particular circumstances of the period.\n214.\tOn several occasions and in various international forums Iraq has fully described to the international community how it welcomed the new regime in Iran in genuine good faith and the sincere efforts it exerted to establish fruitful relations with that regime. However, the course of events revealed deliberate action by the new Iranian regime aimed at breaking the existing relations between the two countries, thereby creating a dangerously critical situation which led to the start of an aggressive war on Iraq on 4 September 1980. It was later established that the new regime in Iran had been harboring such intentions since the first day of its accession to power. This has been revealed by a number of political leaders who until very recently carried weight in the Iranian political arena.\n215.\tIn his statement to the French newspaper Le Matin on 3 August 1981, Mr. Massoud Radjawi, leader of the Mujahideen Khalq organization, pointed out that the senior religious leaders were responsible for the war against Iraq and stated that his organization possesses tape recorded evidence of the provocations carried out against Iraq. The former president of Iran, Mr. BaniSadr, also acknowledged this in an interview on 4 September 1981, published in the London based magazine AdDastour. In that interview he declared:\n\\\"I remember that during the first months of the revolution and the accession of Khomeini to power, President Saddam Hussein sent a special envoy to Iran to inform us of his readiness to cooperate with the new regime and to establish good-neighborly relations ... I conveyed to Khomeini what the Iraqi envoy had said to me, but Khomeini said that Saddam's initiative meant that he was weak and afraid of Iran and that he was looking for peace with Iran so that he could stay in power, and consequently we had to work for the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime.\\\"\n216.\tThe aggressive, expansionist course of the Iranian rulers has made them reject all peace initiatives to put an end to the war, whether they come from Iraq or from international organizations. The Iranian rulers persist in waging the war that they launched in the belief that it will enable them to achieve their expansionist goal at the expense of others.\n217.\tThe Iranian regime has made a number of claims in which it purports to be an ally of the Arab revolution and to be in favor of the liberation of Palestine. Those claims are mere slogans, for how can the Iranian regime be an ally of the Arab revolution while it is waging a war of aggression, creating problems and interfering in the internal affairs of an Arab country which plays a prominent role in the process of Arab revolution? How can the Iranian regime be contributing to the liberation of Palestine while it has itself occupied Arab lands and islands for several years? How can this be the case when certain press reports confirm that despite the closing of the Israeli embassy in Tehran, the Israeli consulate in Isfahan is still open and is functioning normally? In fact, there is no evidence at all to show that the Iranian regime seriously intends to enter into an alliance or a serious relationship with the Arabs for the sake of Palestine.\n218.\tAs a matter of fact, the similarities between the Zionist views and those of the Iranian regime are conspicuous. Both are based on religious and sectarian fanaticism; both pursue a policy of expansion at the expense of others and with extremely narrow horizons; and both are deeply entrenched in their racist philosophies and reactionary tendencies. It is no wonder, therefore, that the relations between Iran and. the Zionist entity remain unbroken.\n219.\tIt has been considered that since the fifth day of air raids against Baghdad 27 September 1980 the Iranian air force was trying to cover the Israeli air force's strikes at Iraqi nuclear installations.\n220.\tThe news media have recently revealed although we have known about it for some time the cooperation between Iran and Israel the field of armaments. The British newspaper The Sunday Times stated on 26 July 1981 that the affair of the Argentinian cargo plane that crashed near Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia, on 18 July 1981 was kept secret because it was carrying military equipment from Israel to Iran as the result of a secret deal by which Israel undertook to supply Iran with 360 tons of arms, ammunition and spare parts at a cost of $28 million. The newspaper further mentioned that the Argentinian plane, a turboprop CL44, was hired from a commercial firm in Buenos Aires, that it was flying between Tel Aviv and Tehran via Larnaca, Cyprus, and that it crashed after having completed 3 out of the 10 flights agreed upon. Military supplies were delivered to Tehran on 12, 14 and 17 July. The newspaper also stated that this information was revealed to it by a certain Andreas Jenny, the Swiss partner of the British pilot, Stewart Allen McCafferty, who died when the plane crashed.\n221.\tThe scandal of the military cooperation between Iran and Israel clearly reveals the difference between the claims of the Iranian regime and the reality of its unprincipled actions. It further shows that the United States of America strove to keep that cooperation secret, claiming no prior knowledge of it. But the American position became clear when Jody Powell, the press secretary far the former American President, acknowledged on the ABC television network on 20 August 1981 that Washington had had prior knowledge of the export of American arms and spare parts to Iran via Israel. The United States undoubtedly took an active part in that cooperation. It is worth mentioning in this connection that the former Iranian President, Mr. Bani-Sadr, in an interview given to the Paris-based magazine AlMustaqbal on 5 September 1981, declared that the son of Beheshti, former leader of the Islamic Republican Party in Iran who was close to Khomeini, took part in the arms deals between Iran and Israel. Hie Iraqi delegation has already had distributed a document containing details of this information [A/36/518]. The weapons, spare parts and ammunition which reached Iran from Israel were American-made. This collaboration, which is now beyond doubt, is in violation of American laws. Now, where are the United States claims that it desires a speedy end to the war and that it maintains neutrality? We very much suspect those claims at present.\n222.\tDespite all those facts, Iraq, which is fighting in self-defense to repel the Iranian aggression and to achieve its legitimate rights, remains ready to reach a just and honorable settlement of the conflict, one that would guarantee the pities their legitimate rights and create the conditions conducive to the establishment of just and balanced relations far removed from expansionist ambitions and acts of aggression.\n223.\tWhile the political and military considerations of the First World War played a basic and direct role in the issuance by the United Kingdom of the Balfour Declaration, it was the United States which played a decisive part in the creation of the Zionist entity, lending it material and moral support and encouraging it to pursue its aggression and expansionist policies, to continue k:. occupation of Arab lands, and to deny the rights of the Palestinian people by scattering them. The United States is the principal supplier of modern sophisticated arms to Tel Aviv, besides granting it financial assistance reaching astronomical figures. The total American financial assistance to Israel from 1948 to 1977 exceeded $25.6 billion. On that basis, and given that the United States population throughout that period was about 200 million, United States financial assistance to Israel comes to $6 millions daily for the period that is, over $10 a year for every man, woman and child in the United States. That represents a sum far exceeding any Federal Government assistance granted to any American State.\n224.\tIt is equally noteworthy that in 1976 the United States Government proposed to offer Israel assistance totaling $2.3 billion, or one fourth of all financial assistance extended to the rest of the world. Furthermore, Mr. George Ball, former United States UnderSecretary of State, declared that the total assistance extended to Israel during the previous four years exceeded $11 billion. American financial assistance has exceeded $2 billion annually ever since the October war of 1973 he equivalent of $3,500 annually for every Israeli family of five members. Besides, the Uniter States Government has often canceled huge amounts or the credits extended to Israel.\n225.\tOne of the basic facts that emerge from the record of American financial assistance to Israel is that the major part of that assistance is devoted to military purposes and that a large proportion of it is in the form of tax-free grants, quite apart from the opening up of the American market for the sale of Israeli bonds. Thus the American citizen has lost huge sums of money which could have been allocated for education, social services, health and welfare in the United States. Hence, the United States has become the principal contributor to the continuing existence of the usurping Zionist entity and its permanent aggression against the rights of the Arab nation.\n226.\tIndeed, successive United States Governments have not hesitated to declare their absolute commitment to supporting and protecting the Zionist entity, despite all violations and serious acts of aggression which that entity has committed. What is more serious is that the present American Administration and its President have declared, for the first time, that Zionist settlements in occupied Arab territories are not illegal, in addition to statements that Israel is an ally of the United States. Lately, the President of the United States agreed with the Prime Minister of the Zionist entity to establish a \\\"strategic collaboration\\\" between their respective countries. This means augmenting Israel's armaments and, consequently, definitely encouraging it to commit further acts of aggression against the Arab countries. Indeed, any increase in Israel's military strength means direct participation in what Israel has done and will do in the future and is, therefore, directed against the Arab countries from beginning to end.\n227.\tDuring the debate in the Security Council in June following the Israeli aggression against the Iraqi nuclear installations, this unholy alliance became evident. Although the Governments and the peoples of the international community as a whole, represented by IAEA, the nonaligned movement, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the OAU, condemned this aggression and found it to be a dangerous act threatening international peace and security and violating all the norms which the international community had been able to agree upon concerning the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes as provided for in the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons despite all that, the United States in a clear case of aggression, by threatening to use its veto power, prevented the Security Council from taking measures to impose sanctions on Israel in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. That took place in spite of the fact that the Security Council had warned Israel on previous occasions that the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter would be applied should it again resort to committing acts of aggression.\n228.\tIn this connection it is fitting to note that successive American Administrations have often turned a blind eye to illegal Israeli actions to obtain uranium and even tried to conceal them, as, for example, in 1979. It is no secret that the means by which Israeli nuclear bombs could be delivered to their targets have been supplied by the United States, including the F15 and F16 aircraft used by the Zionist entity in its aggression against Iraq.\n229.\tFinally, I should like to refer to an article by Jack Anderson in the Washington Post of 30 September 1980, in which he stated that the American Defense Intelligence Agency had warned President Carter that the Israelis were undoubtedly planning to attack Iraqi nuclear installations. Another article by the same author in the Washington Post of 16 June 1981 recalled that an abortive raid against the Iraqi nuclear reactor had taken place at the time when the previous article had appeared. The author further said that in the light of Washington's claims that the Israeli raid had come as a complete surprise, it was relevant to mention the report which the Defense Intelligence Agency had submitted to the White House eight months earlier, which stated that it was wise to assume that Israel was considering action to prevent Iraq from acquiring nuclear capability and that the consequences of any such action should be taken into consideration. The report warned the White House that the problem before the United States was not the possibility of a nuclear confrontation between Iraq and Israel, but that of Israel using conventional weapons to attack the Iraqi reactor. Moreover, the Washington Post also said that it possessed a report indicating that at the time the Israelis were planning to attack the Iraqi installations they sought information from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with the help of the United States Government, concerning the damage which could be inflicted upon nuclear reactors by 2,000 pound bombs supplied by the United States. This took place in October 1980, when the Israeli cabinet had decided to attack the Iraqi nuclear reactor. The bombs used in the attack on the Iraqi nuclear installations were indeed of that type. From what has been mentioned here, the question now arises as to the truthfulness of Washington's claim that it was completely taken by surprise by the dastardly Israeli attack against Iraq.\n230.\tIsrael is the only Member of the United Nations which enjoys absolute freedom to avoid its commitments under the Charter, thanks to the United States. The General Assembly should realize before it is too late that Israel's persistence in aggression against the rights of the Arab nation is the main cause of the weakening of the Organization and that the achievement of its objectives of safeguarding international peace and security and ensuring the rights of peoples to self-determination will be impeded as long as Israel is allowed to set the dangerous precedent of violating the Charter without being brought to account. Consequently, if the United Nations wishes to maintain its objectives, its principles and its future, to ensure international peace and security and to discourage other Member States from following in the footsteps of Israel, it has no choice but to take a more firm attitude towards the Zionist entity.\n231.\tIn this respect, the United Nations need go no further than applying the principles and provisions of its Charter. It must oblige Israel to withdraw completely from all occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, to enable the Palestinian people to enjoy their inalienable rights, including the right to return to their homes, to self-determination and to the establishment of their independent State. As long as Israel rejects the United Nations resolutions in this respect, and as long as Begin declares Israel's determination to remain in the occupied Arab territories, the General Assembly ought to look into Israel's fulfillment of the conditions of its admission, which were set out at the time of the creation of the Zionist entity.\n232.\tRegarding the new and dangerous dimension of the Israeli aggression against the Iraqi nuclear installations, which is a warning that the Zionist entity will not hesitate to use the nuclear arms in its possession, it is necessary to expose Israeli nuclear armaments and to implement Security Council resolution 487 (1981), adopted on 18 June 1981 on the placing of Israeli nuclear activities under international safeguards, as required by the General Assembly in the past. The General Assembly should also oblige other Member States to desist from extending any economic, political, technical and military assistance to Israel, so that it cannot persist in its policy of aggression against the Arab nation and the Palestinian people and threaten international peace and security.\n233.\tThe Arab nation will never condone what Israel has done and what it intends to do regarding the annexation of occupied Arab territories. The world ought to deal with the dangerous situation in the Arab region before it is too late. There is no doubt that the Arabs consider that the United States is primarily responsible for this dangerous situation.\n"

        "file_text": "145.\tThe new President (of the General Assembly) is an experienced diplomat who has served with distinction both inside and outside the United Nations. That background will enable him to guide us with the right decisions in this difficult year. As an indication of his capacity for achievement, I would cite the fact that he personally participated in the talks that led to a spectacular increase in the commercial relations between\nour two countries over the past five years. I therefore welcome his election and also commend the performance of his predecessor.\n146.\tWith great pleasure, I warmly salute Vanuatu and Belize on their independent status among the brotherhood of nations.\n147.\tIn many ways, 1981 has so far been a precarious year for the international community. Feelings of unease and foreboding, foreseen last year, continue to pervade the international stage. The miasma of tension has inevitably increased with the appearance of new problems; it has also been exacerbated by our collective inability to solve longstanding ones.\n148.\tCrucial elements of international behavior  which held out some promise throughout most of the last decade have been fundamentally if not irreversibly altered.\n149.\tDetente has withered as a result of a multiplicity of factors, not least through foreign military intervention in Afghanistan. It is now frozen by the icy blasts emerging from a new cold war mentality between the superPowers. Confrontation seems to be preferred to negotiation. Traditional rules of conduct among nations are under question.\n150.\tPerhaps most alarming of all, there is a growing tendency to regard atomic explosives as everyday weapons to be openly brandished and for their use considered to be as a viable option. Important issues such as human rights, welfare and development have been relegated to a subordinate position.\n151.\tUnbelievably, the potentially cataclysmic dangers inherent in this evolving situation seem to receive scant attention in responsible Government circles preoccupied by national priorities. Even more ominously, in countries where freedom of expression is rightly considered sacrosanct, articulate spokesmen are dismissing the increasing popular outcry against projected weapons systems and against dangerous new strategic doctrines as being at best inspired by a well-orchestrated propaganda campaign organized from outside those countries or at worst as \\\"appeasement\\\". Those of us, individuals or nations, who singly or collectively dare protest our unwanted role as pawns in the strategic danse macabre between the superPowers are routinely ridiculed as outright pacifists or dismissed as heretical voices crying in the wilderness.\n152.\tYet, as understanding of the dangers involved increases, these popular movements are bound to grow. For as long as they are genuine and spontaneous, they should be encouraged throughout the world, and the United Nations needs to play a fa more assertive role in providing accurate and easily readable information on these questions of such vital importance to human survival.\n153.\tLast year I mentioned the growing fear that mankind would suffer a nuclear exchange in the timespan of the current generation. Recent developments have shown that this fear is no deviant flight of public fancy. The bilateral arms control process has been largely replaced by candidly bellicose statements. Today we face a situation where far-reaching foreign policy decisions for the future are being molded by reference to military hardware.\n154.\tThe present psychosis of insecurity and tension will dangerously restrict the real options available in the future. Experience has shown that no sooner is a weapons system devised than its deployment is rationalized. The prospect of rendering arms control even more illusory than it has been in the past is therefore very real.\n155.\tIn his report on the work of the Organization [A/36/1], the Secretary General has comprehensively and accurately drawn the parameters of the major problems on which we have expended so much energy, unfortunately to little avail. The report must serve as our blueprint for action. The Secretary General again merits our appreciation for his unstinting efforts, and his promptings should not fall on deaf ears. I shall refrain from dwelling on every point of his analysis, but there are some areas which really call for comment, albeit brief.\n156.\tApart from the revolting folly and danger of the spiraling nuclear arms race, it should be evident by now that the massive injection of sophisticated weaponry into so many highly sensitive areas of the world provides no stability, but instead heightens tension and jeopardizes political solutions.\n157.\tThe most striking example of the futility and cost of this approach is provided by the Middle East. Today's tragic event grimly underlines this point. Fed by lavish supplies of sophisticated weaponry, actions on the spot have succeeded only in fueling the fires of resentment and alienation, even when major conflict has been contained.\n158.\tImpervious to worldwide criticism, Israel has relentlessly pressed ahead with longterm and ever-increasing land-seizure operations in the occupied territories. One controversial plan envisages the settlement of 3GC,000 Israelis there by the turn of the century. The status of Jerusalem is grossly violated.\n159.\tThese tactics will afford neither peace nor repose for Israel and its neighbors. The process of colonization contemptuously flaunts a series of unanimous resolutions of the Security Council. Without doubt, Israel's Draconian impression will perpetuate the present cycle of unrest.\n160.\tAnd Lebanon, once an island of democracy and tranquility in the region, has been caught in the web of violence. It has been bombed relentlessly and its territory violated with little regard for the lives of civilians. Hie Iraqi nuclear reactor, subject to IAEA safeguards, has been subjected to an Israeli attack in a new and ominous development with worldwide implications.\n161.\tThe shortsighted attempt to leave out the leaders of the Palestinian people in the search for a lasting peace is undemocratic, unjust and unrealistic. The recognized rights of the Palestinian people cannot be ignored in this day and age. They are a separate people with a legitimate right to their own homeland, like any other existing State in the family of nations. For far too long the PLO has been excluded from the negotiating process. As the authentic representative of the people of Palestine, it must be actively involved in the determination of its own destiny.\n162.\tThe situation in Korea is another example. The popular movement for reunification is stifled. Foreign troops remain on Korea's soil, their weapons constantly modernized, and there are fears of nuclear complications. Tension remains high, and political initiatives are consequently inhibited.\n163.\tSimilarly, the consequences of the illegal, foreign, armed intervention in sensitive areas such as Cyprus, Kampuchea and Afghanistan continue to complicate and retard the prospects of indigenous, democratic progress, free from outside interference.\n164.\tMeanwhile, the victims of apartheid languish under an obscene system, shortchanged by the caprices of big business and power-politics. The disinherited of this earth die of hunger, malnutrition and illiteracy. For every ounce of life-sustaining food that those people crave, an unresponsive world recklessly squanders thousands of tons of death-dealing weaponry.\n165.\tAs if old problems were not enough, unfortunately new areas of bigPower confrontation are emerging. The dramatic buildup of superPower naval forces in the Indian Ocean over the past few years is causing growing concern among the 36 countries in the region. The Indian Ocean is being rapidly transformed into a vast military naval playground. Those ambitious deployments do not augur well for the zone-of-peace objectives in that and other promising areas.\n166.\tThe economic and social consequences of the arms race obviously harm irreparably prospects for implementation of a new international economic order based on justice, equity and cooperation. As an island developing country, Malta is all too aware of the myriad difficulties facing the developing world.\n167.\tAt this crucial point we express the hope that the silence on the North-South dialog will at least, and at last, be broken. Recent authoritative studies have proved invaluable and as yet unsurpassed signposts to further action. Those signposts have so far been virtually ignored in the quarters to which they were principally directed. Notwithstanding their shortcomings, however, those reports must remain the basis in the search for just political and economic change.\n168.\tThose are some of the most intractable political problems, inherited from the past, in which the major Powers are involved with diametrically opposed policies. But results are disheartening, even in comparatively new fields of human endeavor. The negotiations on the Convention of the Law of the Sea are still deferred, and the expected results fall far short of Malta's original expectations. The proposed convention has sanctioned an unabashed ocean-ward expansion by coastal States, severely eroding' the area originally conceived as the common heritage of mankind, thus deferring benefits to developing and landlocked countries for many years.\n169.\tDespite this erosion, however, we recognize that the negotiations represent a broad consensus amongst nations and, while pointing out its evident shortcomings, we still hope that the convention will be agreed to by all countries without exception next year. We also trust that there will be no national legislation which will in effect dilute the convention and its universal objectives.\n170.\tThe question of remnants of war was included in the agenda of the Assembly [see item 69 j], and has been for several years now. We are encouraged by the fact that the international community overwhelmingly recognizes that countries have the responsibility of removing at their own expense, remnants which they planted, and also that States responsible should make available maps and other relevant information concerning the location and type of remnants of war they left behind.\n171.\tWe now feel that this matter, which is assuming critical importance for many developing countries, should be taken up more forcefully as a priority item, perhaps through the convening of an international conference at an early date, so that matters can be analyzed in depth.\n172.\tMany countries throughout the world are suffering severe economic consequences from the extensive use of explosives during and after the last war, and it is only fair that those responsible should help in removing the adverse consequences of their actions in countries which were the helpless victims of war waged on, or over, their national territory by outside Powers.\n173.\tMy own country is one of them. It was the most heavily bombed area during the last world war. In addition, against the advice of the elected Maltese representatives, and with knowledge and foresight of the dangerous and long-lasting consequences, the British Government for several years used the island of Filfla, off the coast of Malta, as a training-ground for aerial bombing. As a result of these combined factors, the seabed surrounding Malta, particularly that of our harbors, and the surface area of Filfla are littered with hundreds of thousands of unexploded bombs, in addition to the wrecks of several surface ships that were victims of the vicious bombardment. In fact, only last week a citizen of Malta fell victim, in the prime of his life, to one of those bombs.\n174.\tThese hazardous remnants of war are seriously impeding our efforts at economic development, particularly as regards deepening our harbors in order to attract the shipping of the future. Patient bilateral contacts with the British Government to secure help and redress in locating and removing the dangerous war material they left behind have proved unavailing. As a result, Britain, even after its departure from Malta, is in effect impeding us from utilizing our territory to its maximum potential. We have raised this matter before the Council of Europe, and a fact-finding mission has recently visited Malta to determine for itself the gravity of the situation and to report thereon.\n175.\tWe shall follow up matters in the Council of Europe, but. we also intend to give more details in the Second Committee when the report of the Governing Council of UNEP is discussed, and we trust that there will be a positive response and effective action to deal with serious problems of this nature.\n176.\tIn the social field, questions covering Shakespeare's seven ages of man from childhood, youth and adulthood to old age are being discussed in the United Nations. In that regard at least we can discern encouraging signs of positive interest.\n177.\tThe International Year of Disabled Persons is drawing to a close. The interest generated by activities around the world in favor of the less fortunate members of human society will undoubtedly remain. We look forward to a fitting climax to these activities when the Assembly takes up the item in plenary meeting later on in the session.\n178.\tThe cause of the elderly and the aged is one which my country has been championing for a number of years. The World Assembly on Aging is now envisaged for 1982, and the Advisory Committee to prepare for that event has already held a preliminary meeting this year. More work has to be done, and I expect the Assembly will give the Advisory Committee the necessary time and means to complete its work for the World Assembly.\n179.\tThe problems of the elderly are intimately associated with social and economic development for many nations. The foresight of the United Nations with regard to this question is timely, for by the turn of the century the problem of the elderly and the aged could assume serious dimensions for many developing countries. Action taken now will therefore alleviate economic and social disruption in the future. The World Assembly on Aging should therefore highlight needs and plan for the future.\n180.\tIt is not . only world organizations that founder on the rocks of EastWest confrontation: regional meetings are not faring much better. We previously expressed the hope that the Madrid review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe would prove to be action-oriented. We recognize that if detente is ever to be revived, it should not reappear merely as a useful slogan, devoid of practical application.\n181.\tThe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe provides many opportunities for actual implementation of stated objectives. So far, we have witnessed at Madrid a prolonged exercise in sterile debate, dominated by deadlock. Malta deeply regrets the absence of any genuine movement, even on political initiatives which clearly implement provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which was signed at Helsinki in 1975, subscribed to by all participants.\n182.\tIt is certainly not an easy task to identify the cause of the limited performance by the Organization and others on old and new political issues appearing on the agenda. More so than at any other time in history, many of the issues before us are characterized by their interrelatedness. Failure to act constructively in one area creates a spillover effect which hampers progress in other areas. This linkage gives rise to great potential dangers. But at the same time it presents us with a fertile source of opportunity for progress, if we are all prepared to assume our share of responsibility.\n183.\tOne overriding and extremely dangerous element stands out clearly in any review of the contemporary international situation. The uncompromising polarization in attitudes between the superPowers has resulted in entrenchment being the' order of the day and has now completely paralyzed the Organization and the negotiating process. The air is thick with passionate accusations that one or the other of the superPowers is accountable for all our international troubles. In many critical spheres, obsession with doctrine or ideology is rapidly overtaking rational policymaking. Longstanding problems cry out for redress, but, in this regrettable atmosphere, the voice of sanity, reason and justice is in danger of going unheard.\n184.\tIn a shrinking world, the spheres of interest of the major Powers continue to extend and practically encircle the globe, and even to penetrate outer space. It is therefore understandable that the major Powers attract so much attention and, at times, justified criticism. For military and economic power and influence.carry with them the onus of responsibility; to indulge in cavalier behavior  or doctrinal myopia is to play with fire. Hie spread of their exacerbating instability elsewhere must be guarded against.\n185.\tI believe that the countries of the third world unequivocally reject the harsh dualism of the two superPowers in considering the future of a planet which belongs to all mankind. In the absence of leadership by the superPowers, in the absence of any semblance of cooperation, this dualism has become a pernicious doctrine whose apparent end-result is to scar the landscape with more nuclear weapons, ostensibly to prevent Armageddon, but equally to be prepared to start it. The superPowers must turn away from their present volatile antagonism, and they need help in order to do so.\n186.\tIn these circumstances, the 20-year-old nonaligned movement has to assume a more dynamic and independent role. If the movement acts wisely in concert, it can discourage the superPowers from dangerous involvement in local issues and ensure that they do not use other areas of the world as sites for furthering their interests or for militarily complicating their disputes. The nonaligned countries can provide the matrix for the settlement of many problematic issues, if they can put their own house in order first. Because., if we are to be honest and objective in our world review, we have to admit that even within the nonaligned movement itself there are States which do not always meet their responsibilities in full.\n187.\tAt the thirty-fifth session, 1 gave the Assembly all the relevant details on the dispute between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the Republic of Malta [see 28th meeting]. At that time I underlined Libya's unfriendly action in sending warships to stop the Italian rig, subcontracted by an American oil company from drilling in a concession lawfully awarded by the Government of Malta. Today, 12 months later, I feel I owe all members an honest account of what has happened since then. Malta still has had no redress. Malta today, as it was a year ago, is threatened with military action should it dare to exercise its lawful right and search for oil on its continental shelf. One Mediterranean country after another with Libya foremost among them has explored offshore oil deposits. Only Malta has been denied an equal opportunity.\n188.\tIn this, as in all other disputes, Malta has acted honorably. Within five days of reaching an agreement with Libya, it unconditionally ratified that agreement. Since then, true to its principles, it has desisted from seeking the protection of a strong and friendly country, with old scores to settle, to help it assert its rights. Instead, after four years of patient bilateral negotiations, we asked for the protection of the Security Council.\n189.\tIn return, and in stark contrast, Libya has continued to deploy every procedural and other artifice to delay the submission of the dispute to the International Court of Justice. It is doing this to delay the start of the drilling operations, with the intention of depriving Malta of the benefits of resources which are urgently needed for its economic development.\n190.\tLibya professes friendship to the people of Malta when addressing the Assembly and the Security Council. As is evident from the report of the Secretary General on the mission of his special representative to Malta and to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the latter country firmly undertook to submit the 1976 agreement to the People's Congress for ratification. It also promised the Council that by no later than midDecember 1980 it would not only have ratified but also referred to the International Court of Justice the special agreement it had signed with Malta four and a half years earlier.\n191.\tUnfortunately, the record shows that the past 12 months have been characterized by the consistent Libyan resolve to adopt delaying tactics in order not to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice. The date of midDecember 1980 was not honored. More important, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya failed to ratify the 1976 agreement. To this very day it insists that a new condition be imposed unilaterally on Malta.\n192.\tNot even the efforts of the Secretary General, with whom we have fully cooperated in trying to resolve the dispute, have so far produced results. We cannot wait much longer, because our economic independence is being jeopardized.\n193.\tIn the face of this procrastination, the Security Council has failed so far to take any effective action. It has not even called on Libya to desist from any further threat of violence against Malta or insisted that the legal dispute between Malta and Libya be in fact referred to the International Court of Justice without any further delay. Therefore, I appeal once again to all here present to see that justice is done to Malta, a small defenseless country which can only avoid alternative solutions if it can obtain redress through the Organization. Malta's complaint was made more than a year ago, after we had exhausted all our bilateral efforts. All the evidence has been submitted, and there is no valid reason for the Security Council to delay.\n194.\tIt is a matter of great regret for us that Libya seem unable to appreciate the harm that its intransigence on this question is causing to the otherwise friendly relations between the two countries. Again we ask them not to trample so shoddily on the needs of their small neighbor.\n195.\tIn contrast to the confrontational approaches and bellicose posturing of many, Malta has resolutely upheld its policy of freedom from military attachments. Recent events have demonstrated that this determination is not a mere theoretical approach to foreign policy: for us, stated objectives have been translated into real policy measures, even though our anticipated economic development has been retarded by the unfriendly attitude of the United Kingdom and Libya.\n196.\tIn April this year, the House of Representatives of the Republic of Malta approved a motion ratifying a neutrality agreement with Italy. The agreement formally declared our resolve to break with past history and to adopt a new status: to become a beacon of peace in the Mediterranean. We have made it clear that we will refrain from joining any military alliance and from maintaining any foreign military bases. The cornerstone of our foreign policy is neutrality based on the principles of nonalignment. That implies a position of equidistance from the super-Powers. The declaration made jointly with Italy to which we publicly express our thanks for its understanding and practical cooperation has been registered at the United Nations.\n197.\tAt home, we have thereby accomplished in a short span of time what we set out to do. Our energies will now be directed towards an easing of tension and the promotion of peace, particularly in the Mediterranean region. Many of our Mediterranean neighbors have already indicated their support for such a policy. To them alone belongs the initiative.\n198.\tThe historical and cultural bonds among the nations of the Mediterranean and their interdependence in many spheres point to the benefits that would accrue from planned cooperation through appropriate mechanisms. The longer we delay a concerted effort to ensure the independence and security of the region, the more difficult that effort will become.\n199.\tIn following that path, Malta does not overlook the dark omens which cloud the international horizon. At the same time, we recognize the essential sterility of untrammeled militarism. In the last analysis, it is a costly, dangerous and insidiously harmful one-way street. We have turned our backs forever on that approach. Our intention is to strive everywhere to strengthen peace and security, to foster respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to gain wider international recognition of our new status.\n200.\tThe problems confronting the United Nations have been the subject of much debate and analysis. This year, of course, is no exception. However, at the end of the day, when the talking is finished and the problems identified, we must decide how to respond to the challenges facing the Organization. We have to make our institution effective if we really wish to avert becoming resigned to a trend towards disaster.\n201.\tAs we can see, our expectations appear to be steadily shrinking in the face of mounting peril. For instance, in the area of disarmament, we derive comfort from the fact that the two most powerful nations are being urged to return to the negotiating table. I submit that they should never, in fact, have left it in the first place. The stakes are too high for us, and even more for the super\nPowers themselves, for the vacuum resulting from the .breakdown of negotiations between them ever to have been countenanced.\n202.\tOur expectations are sobered even further by the recollection that these contacts between the superPowers have been a constant feature for many years; so have the negotiations on disarmament. The results speak for themselves: they simply have not delivered the expected goods.\n203.\tIt is therefore against the enormousness of the challenge that faces us and the dangerous situation that clearly confronts us that we must examine what we can do in order to improve performance. A number of suggestions have been made. A better use has been suggested for the sums of money spent on diplomatic receptions. Our attention was drawn to the valuable time lost through the late starting of meetings, to our outdated procedures and to the undoubted need to cut down on excess documentation.\n204.\tThese suggestions are, of course, very valuable and should have been acted upon long ago, but we must also ask ourselves honestly whether they strike deeply enough at the heart of the malady which threatens to engulf us. Plastering over the cracks in the present system is not enough. I suspect that we must take a bolder approach if we are realistically to confront the real problems facing us today. It will not be easy and it will be a long process, but a start should be made without delay, for the Organization desperately needs a new injection of hope. We must go further and objectively consider whether the present institutional machinery of the United Nations is in fact the best system we can devise.\n205.\tWithin the Organization too many problems remain unresolved because of institutional impotence. All too often the Security Council fails to live up to its potential as a major contributor to the promotion of international peace and security by successfully defusing dangerous situations before they get out of hand. It has become an arena for the pursuit of national rivalries. Its functional credibility and our expectations of it are at an all-time low.\n206.\tThe world public finds it difficult to understand a Security Council unable to meet while armed conflict is raging in some part of the world, or a Security Council immobilized from making constructive suggestions before a developing situation deteriorates. A different approach is needed and we should consider seriously whether the Council should not be in constant session, not only to respond to emergencies, but preferably to forestall them and also to follow up the implementation of its own decisions.\n207.\tAn alert Security Council, possibly with an even higher level of representation, would gain more prestige in dealing with the issues confronting it. Each Member State serving on the Council could upgrade its Representation to a minister for United Nations Security ,Council affairs, thus providing deliberations on world peace and security with an essential element of continuity and expertise at a higher level of influence.\n208.\tA panel of experts, composed of distinguished world statesmen and former ministers, well versed in international affairs, could be asked urgently to consider means of strengthening the machinery and functional efficiency of the United Nations and to make recommendations for effective changes.\n209.\tIt has been said that where there is no vision, the people perish. I would submit that the United Nations has at its disposal an ample supply of vision. What we lack are the channels through which that insight and imagination can be constructively applied for the benefit of all mankind.\n210.\tWe stand today at a critical juncture. A mere annual recitation of our articles of faith, and repeated appeals for the emergence of political will, now clearly no longer suffice. Failure to confront and to deal commensurately with the challenges facing us carries with it a heavy penalty, one which we can ill afford to pay.\n211.\tWe have proposed prescriptions for peace and progress, but they have never been utilized. Year after year, we pass hundreds of resolutions which are suffocated by inaction. There is much we can do unilaterally and at the regional level. But there is also much that we can do here. So far, our institution is not dead. But it requires a new lease of life, an upsurge of hope Let us therefore dedicate ourselves to that urgent task without further delay.\n"

        "file_text": "1.On behalf of the Somali delegation I should like to extend to Mr. Kittani sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to the office of President of the General Assembly. His long and distinguished career as a diplomat eminently qualifies him to guide the affairs of this session.\n2.\tMay I also take this opportunity to express to his predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, of the Federal Republic of Germany, our appreciation of the competence, dedication and statesmanship he displayed in directing the work of the\nthirty-fifth session.\n3.\tThe admission of the newly independent States of Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu to the family of nations is indeed an auspicious occasion, and my delegation extends its congratulations to the peoples and Governments of both States and offers them all good wishes for a prosperous future.\n4.\tBefore touching on some of the substantive issues on the Assembly's agenda, I should like to pay a special tribute to the SecretaryGeneral for his tireless efforts to promote peace and international understanding. He has distinguished himself by the energy and vitality he has brought to his task and by his active interest in the concerns of nations large and small.\n5.\tAs we review current world events, our attention is drawn to the deteriorating international climate, characterized as it is by persistent armed intervention, interState conflicts, political and economic upheavals and a worsening international refugee situation. Such developments directly threaten the maintenance of international peace and security and pose a serious challenge to this world body. Today we live in a perturbing world in which differences among States are allowed to escalate very rapidly and dangerously, a world in which opposing power blocs are engaged in rivalry, competing for world domination. Their aim is to subordinate others to their strategic interests and to impose their wills and hegemonistic designs upon them. We also live in a world in which the gap between the rich and the poor is ever widening, thus preventing the latter from realizing their aspirations to peace and security, which would enable them to exploit then natural resources and promote the industrial and economic progress and development of their countries. We Jive in a world whose situation, philosophy and morals are thus characterized.\n6.\tIn the Horn of Africa, a tragic and perilous situation currently prevails. The most basic and fundamental human rights of people are trampled upon through the use of brutal military force. Through massive armament well beyond the requirements of normal defense of the beneficiary State, in terms of both quantity and level of sophistication, coupled with the deployment of foreign troops there, a superPower has succeeded in imposing its will on the States and peoples of the region and usurping their right to control their own destinies. Local conflicts that could have been resolved amicably between the States and peoples concerned have been deliberately escalated in order to preempt that possibility and instead allow for direct foreign military intervention, heightened tension and dangerous confrontation. The implications of such a state of affairs in terms of regional, continental and international peace and security are quite ominous.\n7.\tThrough indiscriminate and unparalleled brutality, entire populations are being massacred, their properties ravaged and their means of livelihood destroyed in a desperate bid at total extermination. The millions of forcibly ejected refugees men, women and children cared for in camps in the region is a sad consequence of that barbaric policy and adds yet another more serious dimension to the tragic human situation in the Horn.\n8.\tIn most problem areas around the globe where there exists a systematic denial of fundamental human rights, we also find, without exception, gross violations and abuses of those very rights. In reality that is what the crisis in the Horn is all about. In the face of those legally and morally insufferable excesses it is the responsibility of the Organization to exercise its international duty in conformity with its humanitarian, legal and moral obligations by calling for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign interventionist forces in the region and reaffirming the right of all peoples and nationalities to free and unfettered exercise of their self-determination.\n9.\tMy Government is desirous of peace, stability and tranquility in the region and has already made genuine and meaningful efforts in the pursuit of this objective. This emanates from my Government's firm conviction\nthat the interests and wellbeing of the people in the region do not lie in the perpetuation of conflicts and confrontation, but rather in their joint commitment to the more rewarding task of national development and interregional cooperation. It is in this spirit that my delegation feels that the complex and intricate problems of the Horn of Africa require an overall and comprehensive political solution which can bring about the restoration of peace, and stability in the area and allow for the safe and voluntary repatriation of refugees.\n10.\tAs has been stated by my President, Jaalle Mohamed Siad Barre,\n\\\"We are convinced that given ample courage, goodwill and understanding between the States and Governments in the region, this goal of peace is not unattainable. The cessation of interState hostility and conflict, the withdrawal of foreign troops from the area, genuine demonstration of preparedness to reach a negotiated settlement, and recognition of and respect for the fundamental human rights of peoples, are some of the more basic issues at stake with which Somalia, Ethiopia and the liberation movements concerned can engage themselves in fruitful negotiation in the quest for a just, durable and amicable solution to their conflict.'''\n11.\tUnfortunately, the other principal party to the conflict, Ethiopia, instead of responding favorably to the positive and sincere gesture of goodwill and cooperation shown by my Government, has so far opted to persist arrogantly in its aggressive policy of conflict and confrontation, thereby threatening regional and international peace and security.\n12.\tOne of the most serious and challenging problems of the African continent is that of the refugees over 5 million in number who have sought asylum across the borders of African States, often imperiling their lives and seriously affecting the economic and social stability of the host countries. Driven, in most cases through no fault of their own, by man-made or natural disasters, or by both, they have become a responsibility which can only be shouldered with the help of external assistance.\n13.\tMy Government is gratified that there is a growing international awareness of the magnitude of the refugee problem in Africa. The International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa, convened at Geneva last April by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAJJ], was a most welcome and valuable means of securing pledges, of assistance and gaining publicity for this humanitarian cause.\n14.\tIt must be stressed, however, that the problem continues unabated and has even become more serious in some areas. Generous assistance has been given by individual governments, particularly the traditional donor countries, by the United Nations system, and by governmental and nongovernmental organizations. However, the international response still falls short of the need.\n15.\tIt is, of course, well known that Somalia, one of the least developed countries, has the most serious refugee problem in Africa. It still remains true that our resources, which could barely support our own population, have been critically depleted, and that severe pressures are damaging the economic, social and ecological fabric of our society and our land. International emergency assistance for the refugees only scratches the surface of the complex and gigantic problems we have been dealing with since 1978.\n16.\tOf course, fundamental solutions for the refugee problem in Somalia, as in many other countries, depend on political even more than on economic factors. In this context, my Government welcomed the decision of the General Assembly at its\nthirty-fifth session to examine the question of international cooperation to avert new flows of refugees, and its strong condemnation of policies and practices which are primarily responsible for the massive exodus of these displaced people [resolution 35/124].\n17.\tLooking towards the future, it must be noted that refugees are unlikely to seek voluntary repatriation unless they can return to conditions of security and of respect for inalienable fundamental human rights. It is the profound hope of my Government that such conditions will be established and that the refugees will be able to return home under regional and international guarantees for their safety and wellbeing.\n18.\tWhile I have dwelt on Somalia's need for additional assistance, I must also emphasize the fact that it is difficult to imagine what the situation in my country would have been over the past three years, in the face of the refugee situation and the disastrous drought, had we not been able to depend on the concern and active assistance of a number of States Members of the Organization, governmental and nongovernmental agencies, the United Nations system and voluntary humanitarian organizations, to all of whom we express our gratitude and appreciation.\n19.\tUppermost in the minds and hearts of Africans is our profound disappointment that Namibia remains under South Africa's illegal and oppressive occupation. We are dismayed that the treacherous Pretoria regime has been allowed to repudiate three years of painstaking negotiations and to negate the constructive approaches of the representatives of the Namibian people. The Western veto of Security Council sanctions against South Africa has undoubtedly confirmed the Pretoria regime in its belief that it can continue to defy the United Nations with impunity.\n20.\tMy Government is further concerned by the apparent hesitation of the Western Powers about their commitment to Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Adopted by the Security Council without a dissenting voice, that resolution remains as the legally valid framework for a settlement of the Namibian problem. We hope that the Western Powers have overcome their initial hesitation and now recognize the need to prepare a new and more determined approach to implementing Namibia's independence within the guidelines already approved.\n21.\tMy Government remains firmly committed to its support of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] as it seeks to achieve those same political and social rights long ago acquired in the Western world through revolution and armed struggle.\n22.\tThe successes achieved so far in the liberation of southern Africa have been brought about, first of aJl, by the determination and sacrifices of the oppressed people themselves to achieve freedom by all means available. However, the United Nations has given important support to that struggle by bringing moral, political and economic pressures to bear on South Africa. That pressure must not be withdrawn now. South Africa must not seem to be rewarded for its intransigence over Namibia, for its savage acts of military aggression against neighboring States and for the continued application of its abhorrently racist policies.\n23.\tThe Middle East question remains a cause for grave international concern. My Government strongly deplores the steady deterioration of the situation in the area, where Israeli belligerence has escalated to new heights of military aggression.\n24.\tWe ask where Israel's arrogance will end. We wonder also for how long the world community will accept that country's position that it is not accountable for any action, however contemptuous it may be of international law, the sovereignty of States and human rights, and however dangerous it may be to world peace and security.\n25.\tThe wanton destruction of Iraq's nuclear facility, which operated under international safeguards, was an act of overweening arrogance on the part of a State which has refused to be a party to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [General Assembly resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] and which, as everyone now knows, used the most questionable methods to develop its own nuclear capability. Israel, however, remains defiantly committed to its irresponsible course, a course which can lead only to continued conflict and bloodshed. The futility of mere condemnations by the Security Council has been illustrated time after time in the past, and graphically in recent times. It should be obvious that Israel will continue its illegal occupation and annexation of Arab territory and its denial of Palestinian rights as long as it feels protected from the punitive measures available under the Charter. My Government hopes that those most closely concerned will address themselves honestly and objectively to the real causes of turmoil in the Middle East, in the interest of regional and international peace and security, through unequivocal commitment to the right of the Palestinian people to independent existence in their own homeland, the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territory and the restoration of Al Quds Al Sharif to Arab sovereignty.\n26.\tThe crises and conflicts in various areas of the world continue to be engendered by foreign intervention, military occupation and denial of the right to self-determination and independence, all of which conflict with fundamental principles of the Charter.\n27.\tMy Government deeply regrets the existing situation in Afghanistan brought about by superPower military intervention in the affairs of a third-world nonaligned country, in contravention of international law and morality. The SecretaryGeneral and the Organization of the Islamic Conference are to be highly commended for their efforts to bring about a political settlement of this tragic conflict.\n28.\tHowever, the mounting bloodshed and the enormous refugee problem engendered by foreign occupation are an intolerable addition to the sum total of human misery in the world. We join the vast majority of Member States in calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the restoration of sovereignty and neutrality to the people of Afghanistan.\n29.\tThe situation in Kampuchea is yet another example of the ominous trend towards foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign States and denial of the right to national independence. The recent International Conference on Kampuchea contributed constructive proposals for negotiations on a number of issues. We hope that, in spite of the absence of one of the parties directly concerned, communications will remain open between all the States of SouthEast Asia and that negotiations will continue to be actively pursued to bring about the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the restoration of peace and tranquility to the area.\n30.\tRecent developments in the world economy reflect the little progress made so far in the achievement of the goals and objectives of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly. The economies of the developing countries, and in particular those of the 31 least developed countries, have reached an alarming situation. It is distressing to note that many of the adverse trends of the past few years have brought about unbearable economic difficulties. The continuous inflationary trends in the world economy have given rise to worsening terms of trade, an adverse balance of payments situation and crippling debt burdens, which are far beyond the capability of the least developed countries to meet their debt-service obligations.\n31.\tThe international community has realized the magnitude and urgency of this problem. The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris from 1 to 14 September, highlighted the need for the cooperative effort of the international community in leveling and reversing the downward trend of the world economy. The compromise reached in' Paris with the adoption of the Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries' will no doubt constitute a new era of international economic cooperation which will lead to better understanding and further economic progress.\n32.\tMy delegation fully supports the outcome of this Conference and will spare no effort to implement its program at the national level. We pay a special tribute to the United Nations system and other organizations for their tireless efforts in organizing this Conference.\n33.\tIt is the hope of my Government that the international community will take concrete steps to follow up and implement the Substantial New program of Action for the benefit and economic progress of the developing and the developed world. In addition, the implementation of the Substantial New program of Action will lay the foundation for the future establishment of the new international economic order.\n34.\tOn the African continent we are seeking to gain ground in the struggle for economic stability through increased interAfrican cooperation and continental self-reliance. My Government fully supports the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa and the Find Act of Lagos, which emphasize these goals and place African development within the framework of a more just world economic order.\n35. The broad and valuable cooperation that exists between the OAU and the United Nations system will undoubtedly be a vital factor in the implementation of plans for Africa's social and economic development. We believe that one of the areas in which this cooperation will need to be intensified is that of food production and supply. African States have a primary responsibility for channeling available resources into agriculture, but without substantial assistance in this endeavor and in the absence of medium-term and longterm planning for food aid their best efforts could fail to avert widespread food shortages and famine.\n36 The very real specter of famine in underdeveloped areas of the world provides an ironic counterpoint to the astronomical sum now routinely spent on the arms race in nuclear and other weapons. My Government renews its call for a comprehensive test-ban treaty and for substantial reductions >n the quality and quantity of the nuclear arsenals of the superPowers. Without significant leadership of this kind, other disarmament goals such as horizontal nonproliferation are unlikely to be reached.\n37.\tMy Government regrets that it has not been possible for a date to be set for the convening of the conference on the Indian Ocean and reaffirms its belief that the conference is an essential stage In the formulation and adoption of guidelines for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. In addressing itself to the central issue of the growing superPower presence in the Indian Ocean in the context of their global rivalry, the Conference will have to take note of the presence of foreign interventionist troops and surrogate forces which continue to subvert legitimate liberation struggles and to undermine the stability of the area.\n38.\tEach session of the General Assembly reminds us of the wide sweep of the global activities of the world Organization. Projects such as the combating of desertification, the securing of drinking water and sanitation over the next decade and the exploration of new and renewable sources of energy are indispensable for the survival of underdeveloped countries and will also benefit mankind as a whole.\n39.\tThe drawing up of a treaty on the law of the sea has been a monumental task, and the recent achievement of the world body pointed to its ability to establish a world order governed by both humanitarian and legal concerns. My Government sincerely hopes that the outstanding objections to the treaty can be overcome and that there will soon be general recognition that the proposed treaty represents a fair balance of the interests of various groups and that it has been negotiated for the ultimate benefit of all.\n40.\tIn conclusion, it is a matter of great satisfaction to us that the United Nations continues to respond in an active and creative way to the problems and the needs of our interdependent world. The world Organization clearly has the ability to surmount and survive any attempts to weaken or discredit it, and it deserves the firm allegiance and support of all States.\n"

        "file_text": "185.\tFirst I should like on my own behalf and on behalf of my delegation to express our deep satisfaction at the election by the General Assembly of Mr. Kittani to the high office of President of this session, which is being held in a very complex international situation with a great many areas of tension. His election as President of this session indicates that our brother country, Iraq, indeed occupies an important position in international relations. His knowledge of international affairs and his ability tc deal with political matters will certainly result in the success of our work. At the periodic sessions of the General Assembly, States Members have common aims, aspirations and objectives. The meetings which take place, particularly during the regular sessions of the General Assembly, demonstrate that the United Nations is the most appropriate place to discuss complex international issues. We can thus reaffirm the willingness of the international community to work for peace and the wellbeing of all.\n186.\tWe should like to assure the President of our frill cooperation in the fulfillment of the great responsibilities which he bears during this session.\n187.\tWe should like to express our admiration for his predecessor; Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, for the efforts that he made and for the productive methods that he used during the thirty-fifth session, which enabled the Assembly to achieve fruitful results.\n188.\tWe should also like to extend our congratulation! to the Secretary-General for his important role. He has undertaken sincere and wise initiatives in an effort to reduce international tension. He has been sensitive to and aware of what is needed to achieve peace in the Middle East and in other hotbeds of tension in the world.\n189.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic wishes also to welcome Vanuatu and Belize, which have become new Members of the United Nations family.\n190.\tMy delegation sincerely wants to see this session lead to better results than previous sessions. We can achieve this only by thorough and responsible discussion and constructive criticism. We must go beyond traditional procedures of adopting positions. We must be totally committed to the recommendations and resolutions of the General Assembly of the Security Council. This will reaffirm the effective role of the Organization and then we shall be closer to the noble purposes and principles of the Charter once security and peace have been attained.\n191.\tWe must implement to the letter the recommendations and resolutions of the Organization and of the specialized agencies. This is more pressing than ever if we wish to avoid warfare and destruction.\n192.\tLike all peace-loving peoples of the world, we had hoped that there would be an end to international crises so that the world could live in peace and there would be peaceful coexistence and equality among all States regardless of political or economic differences between the various regimes. None the less, 36 years after the Organization's inception, there is still a great deal of tension and the arms race is accelerating beyond control. The territorial integrity of numerous countries is violated daily and we see increasing interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The racist regimes of Israel and South Africa shamelessly infringe human rights and attack neighboring countries.\n193.\tAs a result of this policy, many third world countries have had to make many human and economic sacrifices in order to> achieve freedom and make progress. They continue to make such sacrifices with resolution, to achieve better international relations in accordance with the Charter and with the principles of law, justice and equality.\n194.\tWe see peace and security as being universal and complementary; they cannot be divided as some would wish. Thus, the instability of the present ir .national situation can be reflected in the growth rates of several countries. Our Arab peoples waged a struggle for their freedom and won it from traditional colonialism, but there is a new kind of colonialism which would grab their lands and their future. We are facing a Zionist occupationists colonialism which resorts to repression, murder and destruction and to seizure of ou lands by force so as to maintain its presence there.\n195.\tThe Zionist entity has been carrying out this savage policy since it came into being. It is not only the Palestinian Arab people, expelled from their own lands ;. from their homeland and dispersed, who have suffered, but the Arab peoples as a whole; they are all threatened and any progress made in their long struggle for freedom will be incomplete as long as the Zionist entity continues to usurp Arab territory and as long as it puts obstacles in the way of all attempts at progress in the Arab nation. We have suffered greatly from this strange entity which is occupying our lands because, after seizing Palestinian Arab territories, it is carrying out a policy of expansionism into neighboring Arab lands.\n196.\tSince its aggression in 1967, and despite the adoption of numerous international resolutions condemning the policy of annexation and occupation which this racist entity is following in Arab lands and demanding its withdrawal from the land seized in 1967, Israel has arrogantly defied the international community by flouting those resolutions. Israel's aggressive behaviour and expansionist intentions have continued only because of the military and economic support it receives from the imperialist world. It is high time to put an end to this Israeli arrogance and aggression, to defend the just rights of the Palestinian people and to support the struggle of the Palestinian nation, which seeks to regain its land and establish its own State.\n197.\tEqually, it is the responsibility of States and, in the first instance, of the United States, which offers arms to the Zionist entity as well as financial, political and diplomatic support to review their unjust and biased position. It is shameful and sad to see that this Zionist expansionist policy by which Palestinian rights are usurped, the lands of Arab States Members of the Organization are occupied, and all the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and by the Security Council are rejected is encouraged to pursue this aggressive and savage attitude, an attitude which is today considered to be the root cause of a threat to the stability and security of this vulnerable region of the world.\n198.\tSuch conduct, which runs counter to all the norms of international order, and continued defiance of the Organization by Israel bring the Middle East closer not to peace but to war. The whole world, will, of course, pay the price. We remember the political clamor surrounding the Camp David agreements, but they were simply a mask for the expansionist Zionist policies. They cannot ensure peace. Camp David was a total failure: there is more tension in the political situation in the Middle East now, three years after the Camp David agreements were signed. Because of those agreements, Israel continues to carry out acts of aggression against the Arab nations, particularly Lebanon, which is exposed daily to Israeli military action. Young and old are killed, villages and cities are devastated, all with the knowledge of the international communities. Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories are spreading in concentration and breadth, at the expense of their legitimate owners. The administration of all this is to be found in Arab Jerusalem.\n199.\tAll these acts of aggression are based on the Camp David agreements. We rejected those agreements, and the Arab people as a whole rejected them. We said at several international meetings and conferences that we were convinced that those agreements were not in the service of peace and would not enable the Palestinian people to return to their homeland to build an independent State on Palestinian soil, since there was no recognition of their legitimate rights under the leadership of PLO, their sole legitimate representative. Those agreements merely suited the Zionist entity's policy of expansionism and occupation.\n200.\tThe Organization should face up to Israeli occupation, expansionism and colonialism in Palestine and in the occupied Arab territories, to oppose Israeli < aggression against Lebanon, to prevent Israel from continuing military action against the sovereignty of Lebanon and interfering on various pretexts in its internal affairs. Israel is responsible for the successive explosions in Lebanon, of which there are dozens of innocent civilian victims.\n201.\tWe in the Yemen Arab Republic are convinced that the Camp David agreements and everything deriving from them, such as the question of Palestinian self-determination which is mentioned therein, do not meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people or correspond to the requirements of peace in the region. Those accords in fact change nothing. We believe that any political solution to the problem must take the following elements into account: first, the right of the Palestinian people to self determination in Palestine and to establish their own independent State, under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative, PLO; secondly, the withdrawal of Israel from all lands occupied in 1967; thirdly, the cessation of all attempts to install an Israeli Government in Arab Jerusalem, the dismantling of all settlements established by Israel in the Arab territories and the cessation of all measures of Judaization in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip intended to modify the Arab character of the occupied\nArab territories; and, fourthly, participation by the PLO in all international meetings for the purpose of adopting measures to solve the problem of the Middle East by peaceful means, on an equal footing with the parties concerned. Peace is possible if we take these principles into account. If we do not, peace will never be achieved and the fighting will continue as it has for more than 35 years already.\n202.\tMy country is particularly disturbed to see Israel threatening peace and security in the Middle East and terrorizing the population by the introduction of nuclear weapons. Our Organization must take the necessary steps to put an end to such action, to counteract Israel's nuclear program and to ensure inspection of its nuclear facilities and programs by the United Nations and its appropriate specialized agencies. There must also be international condemnation of the collaboration between the two racist entities of South Africa and Israel and strict sanctions must be imposed against these two entities in order to preserve peace both in Africa and in the Middle East.\n203.\tNot content with terrorizing the Middle East region through the introduction of the nuclear weapon and endangering international security, Israel has also attacked the Iraqi nuclear facilities, although their purpose is peaceful and Iraq is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Francs, which installed the nuclear reactor in Iraq, as well as IAEA, ensured that it was to be used for peaceful purposes and for development. We call upon the entire international community to condemn the Israeli acts of aggression against the Iraqi nuclear facilities. Those aggressive acts are particularly serious at the international level because they constitute the preliminaries to a war the consequences of which cannot be measured.\n204.\tWe expect detente, peace and just solutions in the Middle East achieved with the aid of the two great Powers. Instead of that we see a new agreement between the United States and Israel which makes Israel the site of a new American base with a large number of weapons of destruction which not only threaten the stability of the region but also threaten world peace. We hope that the United States will review its position and make every possible effort to ensure the attainment of peace.\n205.\tWe are particularly grieved by the continuation of the IranIraq conflict. We ask the two parties to cease hostilities and solve their problem on the basis of the rights of each and through direct negotiations. We support the initiatives taken by the fraternal country of Iraq with a view to accepting the good offices of the United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the non aligned movement, in order to find a solution to this problem in the interest of the wellbeing of the peoples of Iran and Iraq. We call upon the Iranian authorities to respond favorably to these initiatives.\n206.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic will continue to reject any military presence whatever its origin or form in the region of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. We appeal for the need to consider that region a zone of peace, without foreign military bases or international rivalries. We would also like to point out the danger that could be caused by 'the facilities which have recently been granted by the United Kingdom to the United States in Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, particularly to all the peoples of the region, as a result of the decision by the United States to install strategic weapons on that island.\n207.\tIt is essential that the Conference on the Indian Ocean meet at Colombo as soon as possible so that the major Powers and all the interested parties can discuss this problem, in accordance with the recommendation contained in General Assembly resolution 34/80 B, with a view to reducing tensions in that vulnerable area of the world and guaranteeing freedom of navigation. We are convinced that the security of the Arabic Gulf is closely linked to the security of the Arab countries as a whole, and that responsibility for maintaining it is the concern of the States of that region exclusively.\n208.\tAs regards the problem of Afghanistan, we believe that the Afghan people must be allowed to choose their own future without interference from any other party. Diplomatic channels must be found through which the Afghan people can achieve this objective.\n209.\tWe are particularly disturbed to note that the arms race continues unabated in both conventional and nuclear weapons. Despite the many resolutions adopted by the Organization in this field calling for the cessation of the arms race and of the production of weapons of destruction, that arms race is constantly accelerating and mankind is thus threatened with annihilation. It is therefore the duty of the Organization to put an end to that terrible race and move towards disarmament so that mankind may live in peace and have confidence in its future. The immense resources devoted to preparations for war must be used for the achievement of constructive economic goals which will help, in particular, the developing and least advanced countries.\n210.\tEvery sincere effort to halt the arms race is welcome. We ask the great Powers, in particular the United States and the Soviet Union, to continue their negotiations with a view to ending the nuclear arms race. That is the only way to safeguard mankind and all the attributes of civilization.\n211.\tMy country has always followed an international policy aimed at trying to end the causes of international conflicts which erupt from time to time in various parts of the world. Thus we believe that the crisis which exists in Korea between the two parties concerned must be resolved. A serious dialog must be started between the two Koreas so that political and economic relations can be established which will enable them to advance towards unity on a democratic basis acceptable to both parties. The Yemen Arab Republic calls for the withdrawal from the region of all foreign troops in order to create a climate favorable to Korean unity.\n212.\tAs regards the problem of Cyprus, my country believes that a solution must be found which is acceptable to both the Greek community and the Turkish community and that the island must be reunified on a democratic basis, with freedom of religion and equality for all. The Organization must contribute to the safeguarding of peace and to ending the crisis in Cyprus. All the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council must be applied and made the basis of the solution of the problem of Cyprus.\n213.\tComing to the question of Namibia, we believe that the fact that a racist regime is occupying that Territory is a challenge to the international community and to the United Nations, the resolutions of which are being flouted. Concerted efforts must be made to end that odious colonial occupation. Assistance must be given to the Namibian people in its just struggle under the leadership of SWAPO, its sole authentic representative.\n214.\tIf the racist occupation of Namibia is a challenge to international will, the presence of the racist regime in Namibia is in itself a blot on this page of the history of mankind. Occupation by racist expansionists is particularly serious. The United Nations must be aware of that racist entity and its policies because it is assisted by certain imperialist Powers which plan to allow the racist entity in southern Africa to be as strong as possible. In that way it can strike anywhere in Africa with force and without hindrance.\n215.\tThe Pretoria regime is getting ready to develop its nuclear and military potential in order to carry out acts of aggression against its neighbors and to sow terror throughout Africa and persecute those that are fighting for freedom there. My country has suffered oppression and subjugation, therefore we support the liberation movements fighting for independence and against all forms of racism. The international community must put an end to Israel's and Pretoria's racist actions.\n216.\tDay after day we see the gap widening between the developed and the developing countries, and it is the present world economic system which causes this. It has an adverse effect oh the developing countries and on their growth rates. We need a new international economic order that will guarantee justice to the developing countries, so that they may be masters of their own wealth and avoid becoming victims of unemployment and inflation originating from the advanced countries. It is essential now to work fQr real progress so as to ensure the establishment of a new international economic order on a democratic basis that will allow the developing countries to promote their own potential, to raise their standard of living and to put ail end to their balance of payments problems. These problems are caused by the fact that the cost of the industrialized products bears no relation to the prices of primary commodities.\n217.\tThe international economic situation is deteriorating. The consequences are particularly serious in the sphere of international economic relations, particularly those between developed and the developing countries. We must therefore get back to the NorthSouth dialog in order to maintain stable economic relations and stability, prosperity and peace throughout the world.\n218.\tOur dialog must be maintained. If it has ceased it is because certain countries refuse to accept their responsibility for the difficulties suffered by the developing countries. The developed countries must no longer persist in that attitude. They must accept their responsibilities and face the deteriorating economic situation throughout the world.\n219.\tOur Republic places great hopes in the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held soon at Cancun, in the implementation of the Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the least developed countries, adopted in Paris in September this year,7 and in the Nairobi program of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy, adopted at the Nairobi conference last August.3 Those conferences represented a step towards the solution of the economic problems of the developing countries.\n220.\tWe must reform the international economy. That is a responsibility that falls on all countries, particularly the most advanced. Our Organization must begin to work to this end yet again, otherwise it will no longer be possible to avoid these dangers.\n221.\tWe follow political events very closely, but that does not stop us concentrating on our internal development. Our people have achieved a great deal. We have made many gains. We are building a modern State and overcoming the obstacles and difficulties, thanks to the wisdom and determination of our people.\n222.\tDemocratically speaking, we have made a great deal of progress. Trade unions have been set up. Municipal authorities have also been set up on a healthy democratic basis, because we are convinced that a free people forms the proper foundation for a free society. We shall soon be holding new free elections for the people's council, which will be the legislative assembly of the country. We are completing our democratic institutions, which will be responsible to the Government of Yemen.\n223.\tIn the economic field, our various bodies and the national capital will put into practice our five-year plan. New economic and scientific projects are being undertaken which will be applied throughout the country.\n224.\tWe look forward with great interest to the unification of the two Yemens under the wise guidance of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Many economic, social and cultural agreements have been concluded and a number of joint projects have been established between the two Yemens. The union committees continue their work towards the attainment of the unification of the two Yemens, longed for by all. The Presidents of the two Yemens had a very important meeting last month at Taizz, which ensured the continuity of the efforts to achieve the reunification of the two Yemens within the shortest possible time and the establishment of a new, unified Yemeni State, the emergence of a new political entity, unity of the people, territorial integrity and permanent sovereignty. This will undoubtedly contribute to the stability and security of the region; it will help its peoples to establish conditions conducive to close regional cooperation for the benefit of all the States of the region and will also contribute to safeguarding international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "\n19.\tThe outstanding personal qualities which the representative of Iraq brings to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly assure its success. We sincerely congratulate him on his election. Our delegation pledges its full support and cooperation.\n20.\tA special tribute is owed to his predecessor, Mr.Riidiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany. He earned the admiration of all for the keen wisdom and outstanding skill with which he conducted the deliberations of the thirty-fifth session, as well as those of the special session held this year.\n21.\tOur delegation is again grateful to the Secretary General for his unstinting efforts to promote peace and development throughout the world.\n22.\tThe Government and people of Jamaica warmly welcome the recent advance of the people of Belize to independence. Bound as we have been by close and varied ties for many years, Jamaica joined with many in supporting the legitimate struggle of the people of Belize for unfettered sovereignty and territorial integrity. That struggle has been conducted with persistence and dignity. Much praise is also due to the nonaligned movement, in which Belize had a special place, for making the cause of Belize its own.\n23.\tOn this happy occasion we extend our most cordial congratulations to the Government and people of Belize, and look forward to continued close and fruitful relations. We wish for them a prosperous and secure future. They can be assured of our unstilted efforts on their behalf as they seek to participate fully in the international community.\n24.\tWe also extend a warm welcome to Vanuatu, which has recently joined our community of nations.\n25.\tJamaica fully recognizes that the international community has become increasingly interdependent. Indeed, \nwithin the context of nonalignment, much of our foreign policy is based upon that awareness and the reality of it.\n26.\tIn working on and looking at the problems of the Caribbean and Latin America, Jamaica is convinced that the choices our region makes at this time and the options exercised, first and most importantly within our own region, but not inconsequentially by those outside the region, will have a decisive bearing on the scope and quality of the future which awaits our peoples. It is very important, therefore, that the priorities of our region be clearly stated at this time.\n27.\tIn our view the most urgent task confronting the countries of Latin America is that of halting and reversing the impoverishment, stagnation and in some cases decline of already low standards of living for our people. It is equally important to do so within political and institutional parameters which do not circumscribe or threaten their fundamental rights and freedoms.\n28.\tIn this respect, it is the unshakable conviction of the Government of Jamaica that the understandable aspirations of the people of the region to social and economic advancement cannot be met or fully realized in an environment in which democratic processes and fundamental freedoms are imperiled.\n29.\tJamaica continues, therefore, to be deeply concerned at certain events elsewhere in the region. We also frankly acknowledge our skepticism and fundamental difference of opinion regarding the viability of some other political strategies and approaches to the region's social and economic problems. But Jamaica continues to maintain as a matter of fundamental principle and policy our recognition and acceptance of the right of States and peoples to choose freely their own path to social and economic development. This we believe to be not only an inherently sound and logical principle in a community of sovereign States, but one which, if practiced and adhered to by all States, will ensure that it is the people of our region themselves who determine their own future.\n30.\tIt is necessary and timely to reiterate this because the geographic location of the Caribbean has imparted to the area an unhappy history as a prime theater of competition in the ideological, strategic and, in an earlier period, colonial conflicts of major Powers. That era and the policies it entails must fully and finally be put behind by all States, whether within or outside of this hemisphere.\n31.\tThe people in many countries of the region are seeking to chart a new course for the future. We are convinced that the time is opportune for our region to become a theater of cooperation. Jamaica is gratified that there has been some response to its call for concerted efforts of economic assistance to the region as part of a renewed assault on social and economic deprivation in the Caribbean basin.\n32.\tThe elusive goal of economic transformation, which we believe to be consonant both with the aspirations of our people and the best interests of the international community, will not be met in the foreseeable future without large-scale assistance and increased economic and functional cooperation within our region.\n33.\tIn this latter regard, Jamaica is heartened that developments during last year and this year point to an increased willingness on the part of some Member States to commit themselves despite pressures on scarce resources to programs of intraregional economic assistance and cooperation. This can only augur well. My Government, for its part, is unwavering in its support for and commitment to the strengthening of economic and functional cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean. Indeed, we are confirmed in the view that this process will be found to be one of the critical determinants of the destiny of our area.\n34.\tBut at this point, and particularly in the context of the history of my own region, I would wish to express Jamaica's concern at the heightening level of international tension and polarization. This is for us, as it must be for the entire international community, a cause for grave unease. We can but be hopeful that events do not indeed portend the chill wind of the cold war.\n35.\tJamaica is well aware that in our region, as elsewhere, peace and development are inextricably linked and are certain casualties of rising tension and exacerbated disputes. This is the spirit in which we repeat our call for the establishment of a zone of peace in the Caribbean and emphasize our Government's general support for and encouragement of such policies and measures as serve to lessen tension and promote peace in the region.\n36.\tJamaica is aware that if the 1980s are to become, in economic terms, a watershed decade for Latin America and the Caribbean, as for other developing countries, certain adverse trends in the international environment must be reversed, and certain pressing issues of interest to the global community must be addressed soon.\n37.\tRecent trends towards confrontation and militarism are contributing to the weakening of the fabric of international security. There is now a new momentum in the escalation of the arms race and in the resurgence of the notion that force and military power are necessary elements for national existence. The arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons that have been accumulated threaten Ae very survival of man on this planet and mock our alleged rationally. Hie nuclear-weapon Powers should lead the way and begin to curtail further nuclear weapon development. Now, more than ever, we need to strengthen the nonproliferation regime, to have universal application of effective safeguards and to put a stop to vertical proliferation.\n38.\tThe buildup of increasingly sophisticated conventional weapons and the dramatic increase in international trade in arms over the last decade are also cause for great anxiety. Sadly, developing countries, often a theater for war in recent times, have become an important market for weapons. This squandering of scarce resources on spiraling military budgets has to be halted and reversed.\n39.\tAll States have accepted that the goal of general and complete disarmament is both desirable and attainable. It is time that this consensus on the principle be translated into a consensus for action. It is our expectation that the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on disarmament in 1982 will produce new and more effective approaches to disarmament.\n40.\tDevelopments over the past year \\\"in the Middle East have not been encouraging in the search for peace. Tension and hostility have increased, contributing to the hardening of attitudes. Understandably, feelings ran high when Israel attacked the nuclear facilities in Iraq an act which Was rightly condemned by the international community. The whole episode demonstrated the need for statesmanship? in the region. Peace cannot be impeded by military force. Rather, it must be built on mutual trust and confidence and mutual accommodation. Jamaica has for a long time urged such an accommodation as a means of achieving peace. The rights of all parties in the region should be recognized. The elements of comprehensive settlement have already been identified by a broad consensus in the international community. They involve, first, the withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied in the 1967 war; secondly, the implementation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and national independence; and, thirdly, the establishment of appropriate arrangements to enable all States in the region, including Israel, to exist in peace and security within their recognized boundaries. These elements would require adjustments of position on the part of all the parties concerned and would, establish a basis for negotiating a just and lasting peace.\n41.\tAt present Lebanon is being absorbed into the Middle East conflict and is being torn apart by forces from without and within. The tragedy of Lebanon is the tragedy of a small country caught helplessly in the crossfire of a larger conflict. But we cannot abandon Lebanon to this fate. What is necessary is stronger international support for the Government of Lebanon in its efforts to extend its authority throughout the entire country. The time has come for the United Nations to insist on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon. In addition, we require an end to the attacks by Israel, an end to outside exploitation of internal divisions and an end to interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon.\n42.\tElsewhere, there are conflicts and tensions of varying degrees and intensity. None of them appears as intractable as that of southern Africa. There, the racist regime of South Africa, with the support of its newly acknowledged ally, continues to maintain an illegal colonial domination of Namibia and to entrench further the inhuman policy of apartheid. We reiterate our total condemnation of the system of apartheid and our full support for the South West Africa People's Organization [SW4P0] and its\nstruggle to liberate Namibia.\n43.\tOn the Korean peninsula stubborn problems await a peaceful negotiated solution, but we note the encouraging signs of practical proposals for the resumption of a dialog. In SouthEast Asia the withdrawal of one superPower has not brought the hoped for peace and tranquility. Intervention and pretensions of domination have aroused instability and fear, instead of the needed trust and cooperation.\n44.\tThis year Jamaica had the honor of being chosen as the site of the International Seabed Authority. Once again we should like to thank the international community for this honor. The Government and people of Jamaica are gratified at the trust placed in them and give the assurance that everything is being done to live up to that trust. We look forward to acting as hosts to the preparatory commission as soon as it is established. Like the vast\nmajority of Member States, Jamaica expects that there will be no obstacles in the way of adoption of the convention by next year, to enable the signature to take place in Caracas in the autumn of 1982.\n45.\tThe world economy today is beset by difficulties and uncertainties. The pace of world economic growth has fallen to its lowest level since the recession of 1975. This has been accompanied by a slowdown in the expansion of world trade, by worsened imbalances in current account, by increasing unemployment and by accelerated inflation rates reaching levels unknown for many years. No country or group of countries has been able to escape their effects.\n46.\tThese difficulties are but a reflection of the underlying structural maladjustments and the persisting lack of equity in international economic relations.\n47.\tThe economic circumstances of the North cannot be divorced from those of the South. Attempts by countries\nto find individual solutions have not worked. In fact, the , restrictive policies pursued to combat inflation in the industrialized countries have not brought prices under control. Instead they have adversely affected world trade and have contributed to a further deterioration in the global economy. As the economic crisis persists we witness an intensification of protectionist tendencies in the industrialized countries. But resort to such measures merely serves to impede the structural adjustment process and leads to a contraction in world trade.\n48.\tAt no other time in history has the reality of interdependence been more evident. At no other time has there been a greater shared need to find solutions and to formulate collective policies. The international community must commit itself to managing the process of change, which is so vital to us all, if we are to achieve peace, equity and growth.\n49.\tJamaica is still convinced that one such opportunity lies in the launching of global negotiations which will allow us to treat vital issues such as money and finance, trade, energy, raw materials and food in a coherent and integrated manner. The launching of the negotiations is already one year behind schedule. Time is not on our side, and we cannot afford to wait much longer. We must take a decision at this session to launch the global negotiations.\n50.\tWe have just seen a temporary slowdown in the movement of world oil prices. It is, however, no more than that a temporary halt in the rise of world oil prices. The international community should not delude itself with visions of a glut in oil supplies on the world market and a consequent fall in the price of crude oil. Not even a stabilization in the world price of oil is to be expected.\n51.\tThe high cost of energy and high interest rates in the capital markets of the world are still the major obstacles which lie in the way of development for us, the energy-deficient oil-importing developing countries. These two major items render all current development programming an exercise in futility. The recurrent deficits continue to rise for the oil-importing developing countries; they were over $80 billion last year. This major aggregate of deficit must be financed at ruinous rates of interest.\n52.\tIt is for that reason that Jamaica cannot avoid a feeling of despondency at the meager results which were shown by the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi. A useful Program of Action has indeed been worked out, but no means of implementing it have been found. Neither finance nor institutional arrangements have yet been worked out, and the interim proposals which emerged from the Conference will almost certainly show their inadequacy in due course.\n53.\tThe inability of the international community to find measures for implementing the Nairobi Program has not removed the need for energy investment in developing countries. The energy deficient developing countries still need to diversify their sources of energy supply away from oil and gas.\n54.\tThe Jamaican delegation regards it as a major misfortune that the World Bank has been unable to embark upon the expanded Program of energy investment which the proposed energy affiliate would have made possible. It has been unable to do so because important members of the Bank are opposed to its creation. The investment which is required cannot be financed by private enterprise. Jamaica therefore calls upon the industrialized countries and those developing countries which possess surplus resources of cash to expedite <their negotiations so as to bring the energy affiliate of the World Bank into existence as rapidly as possible.\n55.\tIt is in the context of energy needs that my Prime Minister proposed at the Nairobi Conference the establishment of a center for research and development of new and renewable sources of energy, and a means of promoting equipment which will bring important energy supplies within the reach of the poorer rural people of the world. Jamaica has discovered that a long road will probably have to be traversed by the sponsors of our energy center before the center is established, but we shall reach the end of that road in due course. The Jamaican delegation expresses the hope that the decision to establish a center for research and development of new and renewable sources of energy will be made before the end of another regular session of the General Assembly.\n56.\tThe interest of the world community in having balanced and sustained economic growth and development will not be met if the critical needs of any group of countries are ignored. The growth and dynamism of the international economic system as a whole can be assured only if we ensure the growth and development of its component parts. This is perhaps the single most important lesson to be learned when we look at the performance of the international economy over the years.\n57.\tIt is a disturbing history of uneven growth, depressions and recessions. Indeed, even the crisis we now face is the result of insufficient regard for what on the face of it should be a truism: the whole can only be as buoyant as its parts. That is why Jamaica is increasingly concerned at the growing tendency in the international community to underestimate the needs of the so-called middle-income developing countries at this juncture of their development. This, we believe, carries with it a regrettable element of myopia and does not augur Well for the future dynamism of the world economy as a Whole.\n5S. What is the reality with regard to this group of countries? The fact is that the overwhelming majority have found it impossible to make the transition to self sustaining economic growth. In the face of a prolonged world economic crisis and against a background of historical structural distortions, the sought after transition has proved elusive. Many middle-income countries have remained essentially primary mineral and agricultural producing economies with a measure of diversification.. For them minimal growth and stagnation have been the shared experience of the past decade.\n59.\tJamaica believes that the international community, without prejudice to the real and pressing needs of others, must take seriously the need to assist middle-income countries in such areas as diversification and strengthening of export capacity, inducing high levels of investment flows into their development, improving the terms of their access to the international capital markets and removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to their exports. That is not an exhaustive list, but those are measures which we believe are suited to the needs of many middle-income countries and which therefore urgently recommend themselves if dynamic and sustained growth is to be generated within this group.\n60.\tJamaica is pleased to find that the developing countries have at last decided to devote serious attention to economic cooperation among themselves. We are pleased with the Program of Action that was approved at the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries held at Caracas last May [see A/36/333 and Corr.l]. We thank those countries which have offered to host the series of expert groups which have been identified and trust that these groups will pursue their Program of activities with vigor and will discover how wide an area of cooperation is still open to developing countries without assistance from the developed world.\n61.\tThe industrialized countries are sometimes heard expressing the view that agencies in the United Nations family should reserve their resources exclusively for activities which are universal in character and which concern all Members of the United Nations. It is said that to apply resources and facilities in order to deal with problems which are of direct concern only to one group of States Members of the United Nations is to misuse such resources. Economic cooperation among developing countries is sometimes singled out for that particular criticism.\n62.\tJamaica most strongly dissents from that view. It cannot be said that economic cooperation among developing countries should not be a major concern of the United Nations because it is of interest to only 130 or 135 of the 156 Members of the United Nations. It is neither parochial nor a misuse of resources for UNCTAD or UNDP or IMF to devote resources and manpower to matters which are of interest primarily to the developing countries of this Organization.\n63.\tWhat greater anomaly is there than the devoting of our human and material resources to arms while in this very Assembly, year after year, we continue to hear that in many parts of our globe man is losing the struggle against hunger and malnutrition?\n64.\tAt this time, when the seriousness of the food crisis has prompted FAO to call a global food alert, the international community might reflect on the solemn resolve made at the World Food Conference at Rome in 1974. There it was resolved that all Governments should accept the goal that \\\"within a decade no child will go to bed hungry, that no family will fear for its next day's bread, and that no human being's future and capacities will be stunted by malnutrition.\\\"'\n65.\tThe failure to eradicate hunger within the decade is a glaring reminder of the priorities of the international community.\n66.\tThat pledge will not be kept, not because of any intrinsic impossibility of attainment but simply because the food problem has not been treated seriously enough by the international community, nor have efforts at the national level, an most cases, been anywhere near sufficient.\n67.\tFood production will continue to lag in the developing world, unless effective measures of agrarian reform, tax credit and investment policies, improvement of the rural infrastructure and appropriate education and extension Programs are carried out. Jamaica notes with concern that food production is further hampered by the increasing cost of inputs such as energy and fertilizers and by high interest rates.\n68.\tThe establishment of IFAD and the recent citation of a food facility within IMF had proffered some hope, but, unfortunately, there has been a growing resistance to providing more funds for IFAD. Jamaica hopes that the major contributors to IFAD will be able to conclude negotiations with regard to the replenishment of that Fund's resources at ah early dafceV This is an urgent matter.\n69.\tWe urge the international community to recognize fully the urgency and dimensions of the food crisis and to do all that is necessary to ensure that the call of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [General Assembly resolution 35/56] for the elimination of hunger and malnutrition at least by the end of the century does not begin to ring hollow.\n70.\tAll of us as States Members of this noble Organization are custodians of the hopes and aspirations of mankind for peace and security and for a better way of life. We must translate these aspirations into realities. Therefore let us summon anew our energies; let us pledge ourselves anew to the principles and objectives of the Charter; let us act wisely, lest, as custodians of the future, we betray irrevocably that trust which has been placed in us.\n71.\tAllow me to close with a few words which are taken from a UNICEF calendar of some two decades ago but which I think are still relevant:\n\\\"There shall be peace on earth, But not until each child shall daily eat his fill, Go warmly clad against the winter wind, And learn his lessons with a tranquil mind And, thus released from hunger* fear and need, Regardless of his color, race or creed, Look upward smiling to the skies, His faith in man reflected in his eyes.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "136.\t Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to see you elected as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The trust placed in you testifies to the great appreciation of your prominent role and experience. We take this opportunity to thank your predecessor who so ably presided over the deliberations of the last session of the General Assembly. We should like also to welcome the independence of Belize and Vanuatu and their admission to membership in the United Nations. We also commend the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General for the strengthening of the international organization.\n137.\tOur peoples pin high hopes on the role of the United Nations in enhancing world peace and security. Those hopes encompass all aspects of cooperation aimed at the establishment of the principles of peaceful coexistence and the achievement of detente in international relations. However, since the convening of the last session of the General Assembly events have been moving in a direction which threatens those principles. Tension in international relations has increased. Many States and peoples have been subjected to the dangers of aggression and flagrant intervention in their internal affairs. Racist regimes in occupied Palestine and South Africa encouraged and supported by world imperialism have challenged the international will and rejected United Nations resolutions. They continue in their policies of occupation and aggression against the Arab and African peoples. The same period has witnessed the reinforcement by the United States of America of its military presence through the addition of new bases of aggression and the creation of new areas of conflict and instability in various regions of the world. Furthermore, it has decided to produce and deploy medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and other new weapons of mass destruction as well as the neutron bomb. It also persists in its refusal to ratify the second treaty on the limitation of strategic offensive arms [SALT II].\n138.\tThat aggressive conduct adopted by world imperialism, in undermining the principles of the policy of international detente with a return to the cold war, once again endangers world peace and security. It is the responsibility of the United Nations to endeavor forcefully and relentlessly to preempt those Powers by affirming its continued rejection of such policies, by warning of their dangers and by working towards their elimination. Democratic Yemen is of the view that the initiatives proposed by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries represent a realistic basis for the consolidation of detente and the preservation of world peace and security.\n139.\tA number of important political developments are taking place in our region. The United States is trying to impose its control over the area through the establishment of new military bases and through the rapid deployment force. It openly declares its intention to launch an aggressive policy and to occupy the oil sources in open defiance of the will of the governments and peoples in the area who have declared their total rejection of that move and consider it as blatant interference in their internal affairs. Those countries have expressed their readiness to protect their sovereignty and independence against such foreign interference. The United States resorts to the use of its local agents to facilitate its task aimed at total domination of the region, the plundering of its national resources, and picking quarrels with nationalist and progressive regimes in order to halt the achievement of their aspirations for stability and development. We take this opportunity to draw attention to the treacherous role played by the regimes of Oman, Egypt and Somalia, whose lands have been turned into military bases for United States imperialism, thus posing a threat to the security and independence of the area.\n140.\tDemocratic Yemen, true to its foreign policy based on the principle of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for the independence, sovereignty, common interest and noninterference in the internal affairs of States, and true to its belief in the cause of peace and security in the region, as well as in the independence and sovereignty of its peoples, considers it very important to confront that policy of aggression pursued by the United States and other imperialist Powers.\n141.\tIn this vein, the President of Democratic Yemen, Ali Nasser Mohamed, has called for the convening of a summit conference of the States of the Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa, along with the presence of other interested parties, to discuss the total elimination of all foreign military bases. This call by Democratic Yemen is aimed at the consolidation of security and stability in the region and conforms to the special concern we have in making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace in accordance with the Declaration contained in General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI).\n142.\tOur Yemeni people look forward to permanent peace and stability in our region. They work to consolidate their independence and sovereignty over their own territory, to protect their achievements and to overcome all obstacles caused by imperialist and reactionary conspiracies whose aim is to frustrate the unity of both parts of their country through peaceful and democratic, means and by the joint efforts of their authorities. The reunification of the Yemeni homeland, in so far as it is a great goal of our people, will constitute an important factor in the achievement of security and stability in the region. Those principles and goals were emphasized once again at the last summit meeting between the Presidents of the two parts of Yemen, held in Taizz this month.\n143.\tThe results of the recent trilateral summit meeting held in Aden by Democratic Yemen, Ethiopia and Libya and, in particular, the treaty of friendship and cooperation among the three countries concluded in Aden on 19 August 1981, will make a vital contribution towards the strengthening of peace in the region and of solidarity between the Arab and African peoples and will help their joint efforts to face the dangers confronting the Arab and African region caused by imperialism, Zionism and racism.\n144.\tThe situation in the Middle East will continue to constitute a real threat to international peace and security unless the international community puts an end to Israel's aggressive and expansionist policy against the Palestinian people and the Arab countries and to its continued refusal to implement the numerous resolutions of the United Nations and other international forums. Peace in the Middle East will never be achieved as long as the United States continues to endorse Israel's racist ana expansionist policies and to supply it with material and military assistance, thus helping it to continue its aggression against the Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples.\n145.\tWe find it extremely difficult to accept the claim by some that the United States is seeking to establish peace in the Middle East through pressure on Israel. Such claims and illusions have been shattered by the recent agreement to strengthen and broaden the strategic alliance between the United States and Israel. That agreement opened the door wide for eventually bringing America to Israel's side and giving it unlimited support politically, militarily and economically in order to realize the racist Zionist dream of the creation of the socalled greater Israel.\n.\n146.\tThe two Camp David accords and the Egyptian Israeli peace treaty have failed to produce a solution to the Middle East problem. Such a solution will be achieved only with full recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, including its right of return, its right to self-determination and its right to establish its own independent State in Palestine; recognition of the PLO as its sole and legitimate representative; the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories; a commitment by Israel to implement United Nations resolutions and to terminate its policy of expansion and aggression against the Arab peoples.\n147.\tThe Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen strongly condemns Israel's continued aggression against Lebanon and the role which it plays in conspiring against that country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Likewise, we condemn Israel's attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor and denounce the conspiracies of the imperialistZionist reactionary alliance against Syria and the United States aggression against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\n148.\tWe support the struggle of the Sahraoui people. We have repeatedly emphasized that this is a question of a people aspiring to its right to self-determination and independence, under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front.2 We hope that the efforts undertaken by the OAU and the United Nations will result in a speedy response to and the achievement of the aspirations of the Sahraoui people.\n149.\tOnce again, we appeal to our brothers in Iraq and Iran to solve their dispute through peaceful means in the interests of their peoples and because of the importance of their role in the struggle against the imperialist and Zionist designs in the area. We also support the constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for the settlement of its differences with its neighbors.\n150.\tIt is regrettable that some countries are attempting to bring back to life the infamous Pol Pot gang, while at the same time denying recognition to the victorious Kampuchean people and its nationalist Government, which are struggling resolutely to build a new life in peace and freedom. We condemn all imperialist and reactionary schemes and maneuvers being hatched against the struggle of the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea.\n151.\tWe also reaffirm the need to respect the neutrality and independence of the island of Cyprus, as well as its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We call for the withdrawal from the island of all foreign troops and the dismantling of all military bases. We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to arrive at a just solution in accordance with these principles.\n152.\tMy country, together with other countries of the world that cherish freedom and peace, supports the proposals of the Government of democratic Korea for the unification of Korea. We call once again for the withdrawal of American forces from South Korea.\n153.\tThe peoples of the African continent also suffer from the numerous imperialist and racist schemes that are being hatched against them and which seek to frustrate their national liberation and discourage their efforts to maintain their independence and sovereignty and to work for the eradication of the apartheid policy pursued by the white minority regime in South Africa.\n154.\tWe support the just struggle being waged by the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO, its sole and legitimate representative, to achieve its independence. We condemn the policy of South Africa, which has as its aim the continued occupation of Namibia, contrary to the resolutions of the international Organization. We condemn its latest act of aggression and its occupation of Angola's territory. We also condemn the attempts by certain Western Governments to prevent the Security Council from adopting the necessary sanctions against the racist regime in Pretoria. The continued pursuit of its apartheid policy by the white minority Government in South Africa means that the United Nations must take the necessary steps to isolate that regime and impose sanctions against it in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\n155.\tAs regards Latin America, we have always condemned the policy of aggression pursued by the Government of the United States against the peoples of Latin America and its interference in the internal affairs of Cuba, Nicaragua and Grenada, as well as the external interference and oppression it carries out against the people of El Salvador. We condemn its blockade of Cuba and call for the elimination of the American military base at Guantanamo.\n156.\tWe support the right of the people of Puerto Rico to independence and self-determination, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).\n157.\tInternational economic relations are at present experiencing a crisis of serious dimensions which threatens international peace and security. Experience in international economic cooperation for development, especially in recent years, has proved that partial and shortsighted solutions are not adequate. The problems of developing countries are escalating and increasing in intensity, and the economic gap between those countries and the industrial countries is widening steadily. The developing countries do not bear the responsibility for this unfortunate and painful situation. Nor can they by their individual efforts break throujgh the blockade imposed on them by the system of international relations inherited from the period of the Second World War. Through this system, capitalist countries control the international economy and the world sources of finance and reap the benefits, while developing countries remain the victims of the manifestations of neocolonialism, which is reflected in their dependence, underdevelopment and exploitation. The real values of their incomes are decreasing, while their indebtedness, the prices of their imports and their development requirements are mounting. Their channels for the acquisition of technology and the modern means of development are narrowing and markets are being closed to their exports, or they face protectionist and restrictive measures.\n158.\tCertain capitalist countries, particularly the United States, have no qualms about blocking international consensus on the restructuring of international economic relations by introducing ambiguous concepts of economic and trade relations in an attempt to strengthen and expand their exploitation of the developing countries and to perpetuate the latter's dependence upon them.\n159.\tThe world of today has reached a degree of interdependence and complexity that makes necessary collective solutions reached in a spirit of true and fair cooperation, without conditions, discrimination or coercion. The result of the dialog gcing on between developing and developed countries is not very promising, nor will it hold out much hope for the future of the world economy as a whole unless the capitalist countries respond to the call of necessity and common interest and abandon all aspects of their rigid positions, which have as their aim the maintenance of their monopolistic interests and privileged positions. Without the political will embodied in radical and courageous resolutions and practical steps, the dialog will continue in an endless tunnel and the clouds of doubt and uncertainty will continue to fill the sky. The economic situation of developing countries, especially the least developed among them, will deteriorate because of their urgent and intensified need for real resources and assistance in order to build their infrastructures, utilize their wealth, train their technicians, provide for the basic needs of their populations and cope with natural disasters. It is a tragic irony that resources and more and more billions of dollars are being expended to perpetuate luxurious patterns of consumption and to produce weapons of war and destruction with which to carry out policies of aggression and cold war, while millions of people in poor and underdeveloped countries live at subsistence level, lacking the means for a decent life and daily facing the threat of death.\n160. Developing countries collectively have become aware of the substance and core of the crisis and have established the principles of collective self-reliance in view of their similar circumstances and common experience. Within the framework of the nonaligned movement and the Group of 77, they have drawn up a strategy of action for their development and evolution in all fields. They are still at the beginning of the road, but with closer cooperation they will achieve many of their goals and aspirations. This, however; does not constitute an alternative to dialog and cooperation with developed countries, within the framework of the principles of integration, equality and justice, for the establishment of the new international economic order. We can only hope for an early start on the global negotiations.\n"

        "file_text": " It gives me great pleasure to express to Mr. Kittani, on behalf of Kuwait, our warmest and most heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. His election is a testimony to the high esteem in which he is held in international circles, as a man of vast experience and outstanding competence. The trust which the General Assembly has placed in him is not only a recognition of his personal attributes but also a symbolic acknowledgment by the international community of the role played by the sister State of Iraq in international bodies. It is a privilege to have presiding over our meetings a man of great and long experience of the activities of this world Organization, a man who has played a remarkable role in supporting the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. While wishing him the greatest success in presiding over this session, I would like to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, the President of the\nthirty-fifth session and the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, who displayed a high degree of competence and wisdom during his presidency.\n170.\tI should also like to pay a tribute, on behalf of Kuwait, to the SecretaryGeneral for the efforts he has made to promote world peace and security, and to express our appreciation of his quiet diplomacy and the remarkable way he uses his good offices to ease tensions in various parts of the world.\n171.\tKuwait, which believes that the international Organization is a miniature image of the community of nations, wishes to congratulate the State of Vanuatu and the State of Belize on joining the United Nations, and would also like to express its belief that those new Members will fulfill their international commitments and play their part in shouldering international responsibilities with great competence.\n172.\tThe current international situation is marked by signs of a deterioration in international relations. We detect in those signs a threat to the policies of detente, the existence of which previously constituted one of the most encouraging safeguards of world peace and security. Its absence could lead to a recurrence of the cold war, which once led us to the dangerous policies of brinkmanship.\n173.\tThere are also unfortunate indications of the re emergence of the arms race, particularly in the nuclear sphere, and that coincides with a worsening of the world economic crisis and an increase in the spread of poverty and famine in the world.\n174.\tFurthermore, the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of various nations are being jeopardized by the conflict between the major Powers. It is regrettable that the lofty concept of the force of right as a source of peace is now being replaced by a new and dangerous concept which relies on military force as a source of legality and an effective instrument in international relations.\n175.\tThe tendency to resort to the use of military force, or t* e threat of it, has increased substantially, to the extent that it has been coupled in some cases with military intervention and occupation. As a result, we feel we are drifting back to the law of the jungle and the gunboat diplomacy that permeated relations among nations in the dark ages, and drifting away from the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law.\n176.\tKuwait, sensing the potential dangers in the present world situation, would like to appeal for rapid measures to improve international relations, eliminate the causes of tension and translate the principles of the Charter into action. Kuwait also endorses the idea of convening a world conference on disarmament, to be attended by all nations and to be preceded by adequate preparations in order to guarantee a considerable degree of success.\n177.\tThe situation on our Asian continent is no better than anywhere else, thanks to the increasing competition between the big Powers, particularly the Soviet Union and the United States, for a military presence in the Indian\u2003Ocean and the Arabian Sea. Naval fleets are also being stationed closer and closer to our area on pretexts that are not acceptable to our people.\n178.\tKuwait has supported from the outset the efforts being made to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. We appreciate the efforts made so far by the AD Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean in preparation for the convening, we hope at an early date, of a conference to discuss this matter.\n179.\tThe nations of the Indian Ocean area have in the past suffered a lot from bigPower conflicts. This has led to the realization by those nations of the potential dangers of 'such bigPower activities. Therefore, the time has come to conclude an international agreement proclaiming the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.\n180.\tKuwait strongly believes in the idea of regional cooperation among States, since such cooperation among like-minded States of any region plays a role in easing any tensions which may arise in that region. It also increases the possibility of the most effective exploitation of the natural resources and the safeguarding of the economic development of the countries of the area in a more scientific and coordinated manner. The Arab Gulf States, in accordance with their strong belief in this principle, have therefore taken the constructive step of establishing the Gulf Cooperation Council, which, as the Council's charter provides, aims at \\\"achieving a greater degree of coordination and integration in all fields and [at] forging closer relations between its members\\\".\n181.\tWe believe that that Council will make an effective contribution to stability in the area and will help to prevent foreign intervention in issues which are the concern of the Gulf States alone.\n182.\tKuwait believes that responsibility for the security and protection of the Gulf rests with the Gulf States alone. We therefore oppose policies designed to make people believe that the area needs some kind of foreign military presence, whether in the form of the so-called rapid deployment force or in that of military facilities in certain areas. It is Kuwait's conviction that the propagation of such ideas is detrimental to the stability of this vital area of the world and creates an undesirable competition between the superPowers in our backyard.\n183.\tThe world suffers today more than at any time in the past from an increasing number of international problems on which the fate of world peace and the future of mankind depend. The continued deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan constitutes a direct threat not only to the security and sovereignty of the surrounding countries, but to the international community in general. We therefore call for the acceleration of efforts to find a peaceful and just solution to the Afghanistan crisis, in accordance with the General Assembly resolutions calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and supporting the right of the people of Afghanistan to self-determination and the establishment of the political system which it considers suitable, without foreign interference. We also support the right of the Afghan refugees to return to their country, as called for in the New Delhi Declaration of February 1981, at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of NonAligned Countries [see A/36/116 and Corr. 1, annex].\n184.\tWe are also greatly concerned by the continuance of the IraqIran war and hope that the peaceful efforts to end the war in such a way as to guarantee peace, legality and justice will be continued.\n185.\tOnly a few days ago the General Assembly wound up the eighth emergency special session convened to discuss the question of Namibia and adopted resolution ES8/2 condemning South Africa for its continued control and occupation of that Territory and reiterating the principles which we have always supported but which South Africa continues to ignore.\n186.\tWe believe that the five Western countries, particularly the United States, should carry out the historic responsibilities they assigned themselves and exert effective pressure on South Africa to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\n187.\tWe should also like to express our support for and solidarity with the black majority in South Africa in their bitter struggle against the odious policies of apartheid pursued by the South African regime, the continuance of which is a disgrace to all of mankind. The Government of Kuwait therefore continues to support the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against that racist regime in order to force it to comply with United Nations resolutions.\n188.\tThere is no doubt that the present strained relations between the two superPowers and their gradual abandonment of the policy of detente will lead to a fierce competition, which will revitalize the efforts by those superPowers to polarize as many small nations as possible and entice them somehow into one of the two camps, East or West. That will in turn undoubtedly increase the responsibilities of the nonaligned nations, which should have at the top of their list of priorities opposition to alignments, polarization and the creation of military bases or spheres of influence.\n189.\tThe nonaligned nations are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of their first summit conference, which marked the emergence of that group, which has played and continues to play a major role in organizing the troubled world of today.\n190.\tIn spite of the fact that the path of nonalignment has always been fraught with difficulties, nonaligned policies have remained steadfast and have asserted themselves in the midst of the events of the last two decades. I would be remiss if I did not express appreciation of the efforts made by those nations to bring about fundamental changes in international institutions, such as the elimination of the remaining pockets of colonialism, the settlement of the differences between various nations of the group by peaceful means, the elimination of unjust economic and social conditions, the preservation of spiritual and human values and the reinforcement of the democratic spirit in international relations.\n191 Any talk about the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, human rights or the principles of justice will be meaningless as long as the Middle East crisis, particularly the core of that crisis the cause of the Palestinian people, who have suffered the bitterness of dispersion, oppression, dispossession and the denial of their national rights for more than three decades remains unresolved.\n192.\tIt is indeed an appalling irony that a great Power, which should be fulfilling its special international responsibilities in its capacity as a permanent member of the Security Council, which was originally set up to preserve peace and security namely, the United States should instead play such a part in creating and fomenting the main problem threatening world peace and security in our time, one of the most important and most sensitive regions in the world, the Middle East.\n193.\tHad it not been for continued United States support and assistance and the reluctance of the United States Government to adopt a balanced policy which would take into consideration the interests of all parties, within the framework of the principles reflecting the wishes of the international community, international justice, the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, Israel would not have been able to continue its occupation of Arab territories or its refusal to allow the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate national rights.\n194.\tThe deteriorating situation in Lebanon drains the Arab joint effort to establish peace in the Middle East. Together with its sister Arab members of the Supreme Arab Follow-up Committee, Kuwait continues to exert every effort to establish peace and stability in Lebanon and to preserve its security, sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity under its legitimate authority. We are hopeful that those efforts will bear fruit. We shall pursue our efforts until a normal and peaceful situation is restored in the area. We believe, however, that the main guarantee of the restoration of peace in Lebanon is the cessation of Israel's aggressive practices and persistent attempts to interfere in Lebanese affairs, and the discontinuance of Israel's brutal attacks against the innocent Lebanese people and its violations of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n195.\tA new dimension in Israeli designs was revealed by its attack last June on Iraqi nuclear installations, which constituted an encroachment on the rights of all nations and the aspirations of all peoples to develop their economies so as to serve their development objectives and to utilize their resources so as to achieve progress and prosperity.\n196.\tThe United States bears a special responsibility to put a stop to Israel's irresponsible actions, since by its total support it has turned Israel into the main source of danger to the security of the region.\n197.\tOn the other hand, the question of Palestine remains pivotal for the Middle East, and unless that issue is resolved in a manner which will safeguard the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, particularly its right to self-determination and the creation of its own State, the general situation in the Middle East will not change; in fact, it will become more dangerous and more explosive, as proved by the events of the last few months.\n198.\tWe have been proved right about what we have been saying since the signing of the Camp David accords that this process was anything but conducive to peace in the Middle East and that it was, in effect, a process which would only increasingly complicate the situation. The claim that was made and is still being repeated that there is no alternative to peace has also been proved to be a fallacy by the fact that peace has not been achieved and the expansionist designs and aggressive attitude of Israel have not diminished. It is our conviction that the following elements are essential for the achievement of genuine peace in the Middle East.\n199.\tThe first is the participation of all the principal parties to the issue in the settlement process. The most important among those parties is the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The absolute loyalty to the PLO expressed by the Palestinian people, especially by those who live in the West Bank and Gaza who, despite the brutalities of a coercive occupation authority, have resisted\\\" all efforts to weaken their loyalty to the PLO, should be clearcut proof to anyone who has any doubts on the matter. This fact has been recognized by most Member States. The facts of the situation also prove that the only solution is to recognize the fact that the...PLO exists and that it enjoys the absolute support of the people of Palestine.\n200.\tSecondly, Israel must withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem. The pretext of security requirements resorted to by Israel in an effort to disguise its expansionist designs is but a flimsy argument that does not deceive anyone.\n201.\tThirdly, like  other peoples in the world, the Palestinian people should be guaranteed the right to self-determination and the right to have its own independent State. The right of the Palestinian refugees to repatriation, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions, should also be safeguarded.\n202.\tA new element has recently emerged in United StatesIsraeli relations and is being referred to as \\\"strategic cooperation\\\" between the two countries. This cooperation, we believe, will have negative effects and will place more obstacles in the way of any effort to achieve peace in the Middle East.\n203.\tKuwait would like to state the following in this respect.\n204.\tFirst of all, such cooperation is in our view an ill conceived venture aimed at confronting a fictitious danger which the United States and Israel wish to impose on our area. It is our duty therefore to dispel this illusion, which has been blown up out of all proportion, for it only serves to cloud the facts and draw the entire area towards a new war, with grave consequences for world peace and security.\n205.\tSecondly, this cooperation will make the Middle East region once again a hotbed of alliances, spheres of influence and the cold war, the consequences of which will have their impact on the commitment of the Arab nations to the policy of nonalignment, which is indispensable to our peoples.\n206.\tThirdly, this cooperation will upset the necessary balance in the policy of a Power that plays a major role in the efforts to resolve the Middle East crisis.\n207.\tWe believe that the responsibility for rejecting and resisting this new strategic co operation should not lie with the Middle East States alone, but should be shared by ail peace-loving nations, since the responsibility for world peace and security is a collective one.\n208.\tIn the last two decades the world has been liberated from political colonization and must now be liberated front economic imperialism. We support that course, in which Kuwait has played an important role. However, I should like to emphasize the unavoidable necessity of resolving the question of political justice inherent in the Palestine issue before we are able to assume the economic role we aspire to play. Political justice is the cornerstone of economic justice. Any negotiations on socioeconomic justice in the world as a whole will therefore be pointless if political justice is not achieved in our part of the world. The continuance of an unresolved Palestine question would undoubtedly affect that role, as this question is taking up much of our energies.\n209.\tThe world economic situation is characterized by increasing rates of inflation in all the countries of the world, an increase in the national product at a lesser rate than the increase in population, an increase in the rate of unemployment, an increase in rates of interest and an increase in foreign debt.\n210.\tThe advanced nations bear a responsibility to share in the solution of the economic problems of the developing nations, since they have been responsible for the present recession in the world economic situation.\n211.\tThe convening by the developing nations of the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held at Caracas in May 1981, on the eve of the failure of the preparatory attempts to launch the global negotiations, has served as an incentive for these nations to look for ways and means of developing their economies on the basis of cooperation.\n212.\tWe favor the efforts by the world community to conserve energy, but we should like to mention that the responsibility for meeting world energy needs does not rest with the oil-producing countries alone. The advanced nations should embark more seriously on efforts to develop alternative sources of energy and should cooperate with developing nations to explore those sources. The advanced nations undoubtedly have sufficient resources and technical and human capabilities to achieve this objective.\n213.\tKuwait and other Arab and developing nations are exerting every possible effort to help the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea resolve its present dilemma, which will not be done unless the obstacles impeding the investment in and utilization of the resources of the sea in an Organized manner for the benefit of this generation as well as the future generations are eliminated.\n214.\tThe State of Kuwait appreciates the importance of the serious participation of the Government of the United States of America in the current negotiations so that the Conference does not lose the momentum it gained in its past sessions. We hope that the new United States Administration will change its stand regarding future negotiations so that the Conference can consolidate the positive achievements resulting from 10 years of intensive efforts and be able to complete its deliberations in 1982.\n215.\tIn conclusion, I should like to wish this important session all success in helping to translate the resolutions and recommendations of the previous sessions into action, thereby fulfilling the hopes underlying them.\n"

        "file_text": "The Islamic revolution of Iran, an anti-imperialist, anti-colonial and anti-despotic revolution led by Imam Khomeini, embraced victory on 11 February 1979 at the cost of the blood of some 60,000 martyrs and the crippling of over 100,000 persons whose holy motto was Allahu Akbar (God is great) followed by the political slogan of \\\"Independence, Freedom, Islamic Republic\\\".\n252.\tHaving its roots in the sublime teachings of the Holy Koran, our Islamic revolution aims primarily at the establishment of equality, fraternity and equal rights for all mankind irrespective of such petty considerations as race, language or the color of a man's skin.\n253.\tOur revolution considers man, the noblest of God's creatures on earth, as the principal theme in the making of world history, and strives for the elevation of man's spiritual status and his progress towards moral perfection, as the most important and perpetual mission of the revolution; it has, therefore, set itself as its first priority obligation the struggle for the liberation of man from all colonial and inhuman bondage.\n254.\tSince struggle, political action, mysticism and religious faith do not form separate categories in the minds of our nation, it necessarily follows that the guidelines and the general direction of our foreign policy are already\ndecided by the sublime doctrine of Islam which, above all, aims at creating men and women of virtue. For this reason, there is perhaps no other revolutionary nation which believes more deeply in peace for humanity than the Iranian people and none other more prepared for every sacrifice for the establishment of a peace which would guarantee the interests of the deprived and the oppressed throughout the world.\n255.\tIn carrying out our policies, we are determined not to slip an inch towards the West or the East, towards die United States of America, the Soviet Union or China; we intend to remain independent.\n256.\tWe are determined to build a new world on the basis of the sublime teachings of Islam for the salvation of mankind and to offer humanity, which thirsts for justice, a new framework of human values. We assure the people of the world that revolutionary Islamic Iran does not seek to create turbulence anywhere in the world. We declare, with our revolutionary frankness, that the key to the understanding of the foreign policy of Iran lies in the comprehension of the motives behind the unusual resistance and sacrifices of our people and that this understanding may lay the foundation of a series of new relationships based on respect for the independence of the oppressed countries and for their sovereignty.\n257.\tFor over a century our country has been exposed to mundane Western values the worship of money, material luxuries and power. Therefore one of our most challenging post-revolutionary tasks has been the breaking down of this nonhuman value system, but we can now declare that our people's great revolution has, at the price of the blood of numerous martyrs, succeeded not only in defeating Western-oriented tendencies, but in completely revolutionizing the value system dominating our society. It is for this reason that American imperialism and other oppressive powers are trying to recruit sympathizers from among the well-to do strata of our society, who have been more or less affected by the nonsensical slogan \\\"the American dream\\\". An investigation into the human structure of our so-called leftist organizations, some of which hid themselves behind Islamic masks, will show that even here the organizational membership originates in the families of capitalists, technocrats, property barons and bureaucrats of the overthrown regime of die deposed Shah, whose interests have been smashed by the Islamic system of our revolution. Our late President, the martyr Rajaie, who was murdered at the hands of the terrorists of such interests groups, was a poor street hawker and our late Prime Minister, the martyr Bahonar, earned only enough money to keep his body and soul together. All our present statesmen come from die poor and the oppressed families of Iran, that is, the same people who made a victorious revolution with their bare hands and raised fists.\n258.\tIn Iran today, a man is not valued for his position as president or premier; nor is he assessed by his wealth or power; the determining factors are his scruples, his virtues and his self-sacrifice for the good of society. It is exactly for this reason that the leader of our revolution, Imam Khomeini, says: \\\"Our real leader is that 13 year old boy who threw himself under an Iraqi tank with a bomb tied to his body and destroyed it\\\". The martyrdom of some 80 statesmen, including a President, a Prime Minister, a President of the Supreme Court and many ministers and deputy ministers, as a result of terrorists' bomb explosions, and their immediate replacement by other revolutionaries ready to die for the cause of Islam, was another glittering example of our new system of Islamic values as opposed to an American inspired anti human value system.\n259.\tToday, United States imperialism is making its last desperate attempts through a variety of henchmen and agents in Iran, ignorantly believing that by murdering our leaders and statesmen and by terrorizing our revolutionary people it might one day return to Iran. The Yankee imperialists fail to understand that our great Islamic revolution does not depend on individuals, that it relies only on God Almighty and the Iranian masses who are constantly present on the political scene, and that the current of revolution is a river of no return. This has been clearly witnessed when hundreds of our leaders and administrators have fallen victim to political assassination and ruthless terrorist bomb attacks. Had this happened in any other country, regardless of its political system, the Government of the country would have plunged into anarchy and chaos, whereas in our Islamic revolution martyrdom serves only to strengthen the determination and unity of our people. A\n260.\tThe Iranian people and their revolutionary leader regard their selfless efforts for the consolidation of an Islamic republic in Iran as a struggle for the victory of truth over falsehood, and revolutionary death as a blessed step in the direction of the eternal source of life. We are absolutely sure that the leaders of the superPowers do not appreciate this divine doctrine and that is exactly the reason why the United States continues to resort to abortive attempts, coups and conspiracies in Iran and does not seem to learn anything from its oft-repeated mistakes.\n261.\tSince our victorious Islamic revolution, the United States of America has done everything in its satanic power td overthrow our Islamic Republic. It has invaded Iran with military aircraft and helicopter gunships, it has staged an abortive coup d'etat, it has instigated civil war in Iran and it encouraged its cryptic Iraqi client to invade Iran with 12 of the best equipped army divisions when chaotic post-revolutionary Iran had no organized army with which to defend itself. And now it has resorted to the devilish tactic of assassinating and bombing our most virtuous and our most valuable revolutionary figures. But at the same time its cries and protests against human rights violations in Iran have filled the air Our people view these advocates of human rights, whose hands are drenched in the blood of oppressed peoples throughout the world, with the contempt and derision they deserve. We are quite familiar with the nature and the sort of human rights that the United States advocates. It is the sort of human rights that means keeping silent when Yankee imperialism commits mass murders throughout the world but suddenly becoming vociferous when the murderers of the President, Prime Minister and scores of others in Iran receive their due punishment in our revolutionary courts. This is the sort of respect for human rights that means not lifting a finger to condemn the military apparatus of the Zionist nonentity when it mass-murders the innocent people of south Lebanon. This is a new concept of human rights fabricated by imperialism and Zionism. It is the sort of human rights whose advocates are the designers and manufacturers of nuclear and neutron bombs. These are the sort of human rights advocates who shed crocodile tears when murderers, assassins and bomb-planters are executed but whose conscience does not bother them when they drop hundreds of tons of bombs on Vietnamese, Korean and other people throughout the world. It is ironic and ludicrous that all these supporters and advocates of human rights happen to live in the United States and not in countries such as Bangladesh, Iran, Angola, Namibia, India, Libya* Viet Nam, Algeria, Syria or Malaysia. Therefore we declare unequivocally that we have no faith in the sort of human rights whose advocates are recruited from among American or European capitalists, world Zionists or notorious racists.\n262.\tWe believe that humanity under the capitalist regimes of Europe and the United States has deteriorated spiritually and that a new and true image of humanity, quite different from the one favored by the United States, is emerging among the oppressed nations of the world.\n263.\tAfter the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran, world imperialism, headed by the United States, lost one of its most loyal and powerful allies in the form of the Shah's corrupt regime. Therefore it concentrated its efforts on restoring its interests by hook or by crook.\n264.\tI shall mention briefly here a few of those desperate efforts: first, a direct military attack against Iran, which was, thanks to God Almighty, miraculously defeated by sudden sandstorms in the desert of Tabas; then an attempt to divide Iran into different provinces by supporting the Shah's fugitive generals and American-made leftist groups in order to weaken the central revolutionary Government, but the revolutionary fervor of our people demolished all these foreign-inspired elements; later, an attempt to break up the social structure of the Iranian people in order to sabotage the unity of the people, which was the best guarantee of our victorious revolution; for this, the United States exploited the services of its many internal agents, opportunists, hypocrites and liberals, whose clever demagoguery and nonIslamic aspirations failed to deceive our people and could not destroy the unity of our masses, therefore this Western-oriented conspiracy also failed through the diligence of our leader and the action of our people; and lastly, the use of the services of the dependent, mercenary Baathist regime of Iraq, which during all the stages of our Islamic revolution did everything it devilishly could to weaken and sabotage our revolution.\n265.\tHere we present to the Assembly a brief list of the services rendered to United States imperialism by the ruling clique of Iraq before the military invasion of Iran. First, the harassment of thousands of Iranians living in Iraq and their forced deportation from their country of residence; some 50,000 Iraqis and Iranians were accused of being of Iranian origin and expelled in the most inhuman manner and many of them met their deaths in the wilderness of the IranIraq border areas, while the properties of some 115,000 Iranians residing in Iraq were forcibly seized. Secondly, Iranian Moslems were prevented from making pilgrimages to holy shrines in Iraq. Thirdly, the ill-treatment, torture and murder of prominent clergy and religious revolutionaries in Iraq, including the martyrdom of Ayatollah Mohammed Bagher Sadr and his learned revolutionary sister, which was a great catastrophe for the world of Islam. Fourthly, the raiding of Iranian schools in Iraq, imprisonment of the teachers and assault against and torture of their families; there are no traces of many such teachers in spite of repeated contacts with the Red Cross. Fifthly, the granting of refuge to a large number of Iranian army personnel who had participated in the Slaughter of the Iranian people under the Shah's regime and the organization of many political and military groups for terrorist attacks and sabotage against the newborn Islamic Republic of Iran. Sixthly, the transmission of radio programs in Persian, Kurdish, Turkish, Turkoman, Armenian and Baluchi for the evil purpose of provoking tribal, religious and racial trouble inside Iran, mainly on the basis of chauvinistic aspirations similar to the propaganda of the Nazi predecessors of the Iraqi regime. Seventhly, the issuing of identity cards for Arabic speaking nationals of Iran in the province of Khuzistan; those cards bear the signature of the Governor of Basra, in Iraq. Eighthly, the establishment of the so-called Khuzistan Liberation Bureau for the purpose of provoking Arabic-speaking Iranian nationals to speak out against the Islamic Republic of Iran; the same people were later among the very first victims of the all-out Iraqi invasion of Iran. Finally, the perpetration of assassinations and a variety of sabotage actions inside Iran, including the blowing up of oil pipelines; altogether Iraq had committed some 425 acts of aggression against Iranian territory before the general invasion of Iran in September 1980.\n266.\tThese criminal actions against the newly established Islamic Republic having failed to slow down the pace of our revolution, the Iraqi regime, instigated by United States imperialism, suddenly invaded Iranian territory by air, sea and land on 22 September 1980. The Iraqi regime was hoping to occupy large parts of Iran, to open a new front for the disintegration of Iran and to overthrow the Islamic Republic in a short time.\n267.\tNow, as we enter the second year of this catastrophic Iraqi imposed war, the Iranian and Iraqi Moslem nations are mourning the deaths of many thousands, the wounding and crippling of tens of thousands, the homelessness of millions and the destruction of the economic wealth of both countries, running into billions of dollars. This is the outcome of the war stupidly imposed on Iran by the Baathists of Iraq, who will be crushed, chased back and taught an Islamic lesson in the near future.\n268.\tThe world knows that even during the war the Iraqi regime has not observed any moral principles. It has repeatedly raided and hit schools, hospitals, mosques, residential areas and defenseless towns by aerial bombings or ground to ground missiles. The Iraqi aggressors have also made thousands of civilians prisoners of war. They have treated genuine prisoners of war in the most inhuman, that is, in the most Baathist manner possible. Reports by the International Red Cross bear witness to these Baathist cruelties.\n269.\tThe Iraqi Baathists have gone so far in their insolence and contempt for human life that their trigger-happy terrorists, disguised as Iraqi diplomats, opened fire at a peaceful, legal demonstration of Iranian students at New Delhi and not only wounded six Iranian students but shot and injured three Indian policemen.\n270.\tOf course, the world knows that that was not the first time that the Iraqi regime had committed criminal acts in foreign countries. We have repeatedly witnessed Iraqis opening fire in different cities and capitals of the world. All informed people remember that the Iraqi regime was responsible for bomb explosions in Kuwait which it shamelessly attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran, but fortunately the real bombers were later identified in that country.\n271.\tThe Iraqis, who are still pursuing die same scandalous policy, have once again resorted to the same shameless tactics of declaring Iran responsible for the bombardment of Kuwaiti oil installations, and who should help confirm the Iraqi accusations but the United States. The United States authorities have now announced that information received from their AWACS spy planes confirmed the Iraqi accusation. It should, of course, be remembered that the AWACS spy planes only provide the sort of information required by United States foreign policy; for example, they failed to detect the bombers belonging to the Zionist nonentity in their long flight to the vicinity of Baghdad.\n272.\tWe refute these baseless accusations and declare to the world that the statement made by the Secretary of State of United States imperialism is part of a larger conspiracy to provoke certain reactionary and dependent regimes in the region against our country. We warn United States imperialism that these deceptive tactics will not save their Iraqi client from the abyss into which it was plunged by the United States in the first place. The world, especially the American people, should know that this IraqiAmerican accusation is only intended for the easy sale of AWACS aircraft to American dependent clients in the region, but it should be borne in mind that such regimes will not be able to fight the will of their people, even if the United States sends them direct assistance. Our advice to such regimes is to dissociate themselves from the superPowers and to respect the desire of their own peoples for independence and freedom.\n273.\tTherefore it should be evident by now that the Iraqi invasion of an independent country that has challenged imperialist Powers in the area pursues the same policies as the United States-backed Zionist nonentity, only this time the Iraqi regime has volunteered to do the job for imperialism and Zionism.\n274.\tCertain basic questions may help to clarify the unfortunate connection. Could the Jordanian Government receive military supplies intended for Iraq from the port of Aqaba without the permission of United States imperialism or the Zionist nonentity? Would it be at all possible for Zionist bombers to raid atomic power stations without being detected by AWACS spy planes or without Iraqi connivance in the raid? Could a better way be found to revive Iraq's diminishing political image than through an aerial raid by Zionist bombers? Why does France immediately declare its readiness to repair the damaged power station? What nature of regimes supply the required financial assistance?\n275.\tWe believe that, in the same way as the proAmerican nature of die Shah's Government did not remain a secret for long, so the passage of time will show that the Iraqi Baathist regime has turned into the best Moslem friend of the Zionist nonentity in the Middle East.\n276.\tHowever, despite all the Iraqi crimes, a few examples of which we have mentioned here, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has received all delegations dispatched to Iran by the United Nations, the Islamic Conference and the nonaligned movement and has made its position absolutely clear; but the Iraqi regime has obstinately disregarded the legitimate and rightful demands of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n277.\tThose demands are: first, the unconditional withdrawal of all invading Iraqi forces from occupied territories in Iran; secondly, the identification of the aggressive party and its condemnation by a qualified international tribunal; thirdly, the implementation of the Algiers Agreement between Iran and Iraq, signed on 6 March 1975,8 at the ceremonies of which the happy Iraqi party was photographed embracing the criminal exShah of Iran; fourthly, the payment of proper compensations by the aggressor\t*\n278.\tIt is rather surprising that the Iraqi regime intends to play host at Baghdad to the 1982 Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, when it has, by invading a revolutionary country openly violated the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of the nonaligned movement. It is even more surprising to find the representative of such a country and I mean no disrespect to that representative personally elected President of the General Assembly. This is the first time in the history of the United Nations that a Member State has invaded another Member State and the representative of the invading country has been elected to preside over this most important United Nations body.\n279.\tIn the course of the last 13 months, the Iraqi Government has persistently violated the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. In its Article 6, the Charter stipulates that\n\\\"A Member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council\\\".\n280.\tWe note, however, not only that Iraq still sits in the United Nations, but that its representative has been elected President of the General Assembly, which may be considered as a form of reward and encouragement for the aggressors of the world.\n281.\tThere is no doubt that governments that do not find those principles and norms to their illegitimate tastes will not hesitate to violate them in the future as they have done in the past.\n282.\tThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran considers the silence of the international community with regard to the open aggression of the Iraqi regime to be indifference to its independence and sovereignty as well as a serious threat to peace in the world. It is therefore urgent for us to draw the attention of the Assembly to the evil consequences of the Iraqi aggression. That aggression has, first, provided the United States with an excuse for a military and security presence in the region, dispatching naval units, directly threatening the nations in the area and forming multinational rapid deployment forces to be used in that region of the world. Secondly, it has dealt a blow to the unity of Islamic countries and has served the continued invasion of the occupied Lebanese territory by the Zionist enemy. Thirdly, it has distracted the attention of the Moslem world from the Palestine issue and has created a diversion in the anti-imperialist and antiZionist struggles of the Moslem nations. Fourthly, it has destroyed great human and material resources belonging to the two Islamic nations of Iran and Iraq and threatened the resources of other countries in the region.\n283.\tSince the Persian Gulf region is an important international waterway, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has to control navigation in that waterway firmly and strictly in order to protect normal shipping of nonmilitary cargoes. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, for its part, guarantees safe and free navigation in that sensitive waterway. It will, however, not allow the passage of ships carrying war materials for Iraq, for such shipments would constitute a violation of the principles of neutrality with regard to the belligerent parties. We shall confiscate war materials destined for Iraq and redirect the ships carrying such materials to their ports of origin, in order to discourage Iraq from continuing this insane war.\n284.\tThe Moslem nation of Iran does not consider the conspiracies of American imperialism against the Islamic Republic of Iran and other Moslem nations as being a separate issue from the problem of Zionism in the region. Although some reactionary dependent regimes may not say so, a billion Moslems in the world know that United States imperialism and Zionism are inseparable from one another.\n285.\tBut the power of the imperialist and Zionist arsenals, their widespread conspiracies and their agreements on strategic cooperation for the suppression of revolutionary nations only serve to make our resolve to fight them even firmer than before, and we are prepared, as we have often declared in the past, to fight shoulder to shoulder with our Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese brothers and sisters to liberate all Zionist-occupied Arab territories.\n286.\tWe overpowered the logic of force and bayonets in our country by our raised fists, and we are certain that a billion Moslems will have to do the same on the international scene.\n287.\tIn our Islamic opinion, the removal of aggression from Palestine and an absolute recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people are religious obligations. We firmly believe that these fundamental problems in the Middle East will not be solved by anyone except Moslems themselves; no chauvinistic outburst by Arabs, and no politicking by the West or the East will ever settle the matter in a just and honorable manner. That is why the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran proposed the formation of the Islamic front against Zionism and imperialism. We hope that in the near future we shall see practical efforts towards the formation of this united Islamic front.\n288.\tDespite the war imposed on Iran by Iraq and our efforts to kick the invading forces out of Iranian territory, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has never neglected its Islamic duty concerning the Palestinian people in particular and problems in the Middle East in general.\n289.\tWe shall continue to resist and fight with everything in our power against the Zionist aggression against the territories of our brother nations of Syria, Palestine and Lebanon. There is no racial prejudice or animosity towards the Jewish people in revolutionary Iran. In our opinion, however, Zionism is a political movement rooted in racism and expansionism which has abused the divine mission of our Prophet Moses may he rest in peace as a shameless cover-up for its Nazi-type crimes. Zionism is rejected today by all freedom-loving nations of the world, and cannot be further tolerated.\n290.\tAt this juncture, I deem it necessary to announce my Government's view regarding a plan that we consider to be the extension and continuation of the Camp David agreements. We declare that this so-called new plan, seemingly for the autonomy of parts of the West Bank of the River Jordan and the Gaza Strip, is nothing but a facsimile of the original Camp David agreements. We declare unambiguously that such plans, inspired by the United States, are intended to continue American aggression in our part of the world and to drag the Palestinian people and the Moslem people of the world into the mire of compromise. But the Moslem people throughout the world cannot remain indifferent to such a vast conspiracy.\n291.\tThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the opinion that the military invasion of Afghanistan by a superPower and the imposition of an unpopular regime on the Afghan people should not be looked at only from the angle of the violation of the independence and territorial integrity of the oppressed people of Afghanistan, but that we should also consider that such an invasion tramples upon a nation's dignity, honor, traditions, culture and history, and, above all, on the religious faith and beliefs of an entire nation.\n292.\tThe Islamic Republic of Iran, whose people share common cultural, linguistic, traditional and historic ties and, above all, a common religion with the oppressed nation of Afghanistan, cannot remain silent in the face of such aggression. For that reason, our Islamic Republic was the very first country to condemn the military invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union and to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from Afghan territory.\n293.\tAnd we should regrettably add that American imperialism tries to justify its widespread presence in the Indian Ocean and in certain countries with reactionary regimes through the Soviet presence in Afghanistan.\n294.\tWe are certain that the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan will not only deprive the United States of its pretext for justifying its presence in the region but will also disarm the American puppet regimes of the region which implicitly support the Zionist nonentity by taking away from them their best demagogic scarecrow of the \\\"danger of communism\\\". If the Government of the Soviet Union is truly anti-imperialist, it should not deliberately facilitate the expansion of imperialism in the region. If the Soviet Union considers the American presence in the Indian Ocean provocative and dangerous, then it should know better that only a popular, Islamic, anti imperialist government in Afghanistan could reduce that danger and in the long run eliminate it.\n295.\tThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran considers the withdrawal of foreign occupying forces from Afghanistan and the recognition of the right of self-determination for the Afghan nation as the only solution to the problem and rejects any negotiations carried out without the presence of the true representatives of the people of Afghanistan.\n296.\tThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran demands that the Indian Ocean be turned into a peace zone, free from any nuclear weapons and foreign presence and believes that the military presence and the military bases of the big Powers in the Indian Ocean threaten the peace in the coastal countries and increase the possibilities of interference, domination and further conspiracies by foreign Powers as far as their internal affairs are concerned. The formation of the American multinational rapid deployment force in the Indian Ocean has contributed to confusion and turbulence in the region, has resulted in more intense rivalries between the superPowers and will undoubtedly create a dangerous situation in our part of the world.\n297.\tIran considers the security of the Indian Ocean an issue relating only to the coastal States and rejects the interference of the superPowers in that region and firmly believes that the resources at the bed of die Indian Ocean should be exploited for the economic development and welfare of the peoples of the region.\n298.\tIran supports the resolution on the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace [General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and believes that the speedy and complete implementation of that resolution will put an end to the rivalries of the superPowers and to the further creation of tensions in that region.\n299.\tIn our world today, we are faced with a greater use of military force, which in itself is the natural consequence of the intensity of the arms race. The nuclear arsenals of the two superPowers as well as those of other imperialist Powers are expanding day by day and becoming more and more sophisticated. That expansion is not at all limited to nuclear and strategic weapons but also extends to the area of conventional weapons which obliges the deprived and the oppressed nations of the world to resort to greater military potential for their security. Thus, the wealth and resources which should be employed for the development and welfare of the hungry and oppressed people in the third world are used for strengthening military forces and purchasing weapons of war the benefits of which will ultimately go to the superPower militarists. The development and expansion of nuclear weapons, and the gradual increase in the number of countries possessing such devastating anti-human weapons, have pushed human society to the brink of a dreadful precipice and a formula must be found urgently to avoid a worldwide disaster.\n300.\tDespite all present disasters imposed on the people of the world by the superPowers, new destructive weapons are still produced by anti-human American imperialism. The neutron bomb and its anti-human dimension need not be emphasized. The production of that anti human device is a manifest reminder of the criminal nature and inhuman characteristic of the ruling circles in the United States. It is the moral obligation of all peace loving nations of the world, an particularly the American people, to protest most strongly against the production of that anti-human weapon.\n301.\tThe American Government declares that the Persian Gulf region is of vital interest to the United States and other Western countries and by resorting to that kind of imperialist logic tries to justify any aggressive action it embarks upon against the countries and the oppressed peoples of that region. Further, the United States justifies its efforts to combat the struggles of the Moslem peoples of the Persian Gulf countries to liberate themselves from the yoke of the imperialist Powers and take their destinies in their own hands, and its efforts to suppress any independence-seeking movement by the oppressed of the region under the pretext of protecting its bloody interests.\n302.\tThe formation of die so-called multinational rapid deployment force is another attempt in that direction and the reasons announced for its formation, which are nothing more than obvious excuses for justifying the imperialist objectives of America and its collaborators, are by no means acceptable to the nations of that region. In our opinion, one of the main reasons for such aggressive operations 'c the American fear of the spread and influence of the  Islamic revolution in Iran.\n303.\tThe Islamic Republic of Iran considers the formation of that task force as another conspiracy and armed action against the Moslem people of that region and their divine order of 'life. We should, however, add, with regret, that certain unpopular governments in the area have cooperated with the aggressive policies of United States imperialism.\n304.\tHowever, as often proved in practice, such acts do not contribute to the establishment of peace in the region, and consequently in the world, but rather intensify the atmosphere of tension and violence and provide other Powers with excuses for similar measures.\n305.\tThus, we believe that the presence of any alien force in the Persian Gulf in particular and in the Indian Ocean in general for the protection of the imperialistic interests of the Powers of the West or the East will only disturb the political tranquility and stability of the region and will be a serious threat to world peace. And it is on that basis that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has frequently demanded that the superPowers end their military presence in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, stop interfering in that region and close down their military bases.\n306.\tOne of the fundamental principles of the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is to oppose and fight colonialism in its variety of forms and masks. The Constitution of our Islamic Republic considers independence, liberty and the rule of justice as the God given rights of the people of the world, and, while refraining from any interference in the internal affairs of other nations, it declares its support for the rightful struggles of the oppressed against oppressors throughout the world.\n307.\tThe Iranian revolution has, right from the beginning, supported liberation movements and has strongly defended the legitimate rights of nations dominated by colonialism and imperialism in their fight for freedom and independence. The policy followed by the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the General Assembly bears witness to this, and whenever questions relating to colonialism were raised in those organs Iran strongly demanded the implementation of the Declaration [General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)\\ and unconditionally supported die rights of the peoples in colonized and dependent territories to self-determination and independence.\n308.\tA most insulting and disgusting form of colonialism is witnessed in South Africa and Namibia. In that part of the world, a so-called white-skinned minority has imposed its ruthless and oppressive domination over a dark-skinned majority, with the overall support of Western imperialism.\n309.\tFor this reason, all international efforts since the inception of the United Nations, including numerous resolutions on the eradication of apartheid in South Africa and the elimination of colonialism in Namibia, have not produced results, and the racist South African regime, supported by certain Western countries and Israel, headed by United States imperialism, continues to carry out its nonhuman policy of apartheid and prevents majority rule in South Africa and Namibia.\n310.\tWe condemn the occupation of Namibia by the illegal racist regime of South Africa, and support the struggles of the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO, the true representative of the liberation movement of the people of southern Africa. We strongly condemn the disgusting, inhuman policy of apartheid followed by the illegal racist South African regime and support people in South Africa who are fighting for their legitimate human rights.\n311.\tOne of the most striking examples of ungrudging imperialist support for South Africa was recently witnessed when South African military forces invaded Angola. Unfortunately, once again, owing to an American veto, the United Nations was not able to carry out the obligations assigned to it under the Charter for establishing peace and security in the world. Thus the Government of the United States has openly and shamelessly supported the aggressive operations of the South African regime. We condemn, in the strongest terms, this obvious violation of Angolan integrity, political independence and sovereignty.\n312.\tThe situation in Western Sahara is another clear example of desperate efforts to perpetuate imperialist domination. Numerous countries have so far recognized the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and have supported its struggle for the elimination of colonialism. The Islamic Republic of Iran has also recognized that Republic, under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front,  the genuine and true liberation movement of the Sahraoui people, and has declared its moral and political support for their legitimate struggle for political independence and self-determination.\n313.\tIn our opinion, the superPowers of the West and the East should have learnt something by now from the disastrous consequences of their aggression in third world countries and, if they ever wish to be taken seriously when they speak of their respect for human dignity, love for world peace and efforts for stability in the world, they should refrain from interference, especially in African countries, and swallow the bitter pill that the deprived people of this continent, too, are entitled to the right to self-determination. The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believes that the abundant wealth and resources of these regions should be exploited for the creation of a worthy material and spiritual life for the deprived and oppressed people of Africa who have suffered so long at the hands of European and American colonialists.\n314.\tThe Islamic Republic of Iran considers the shooting down of Libyan aircraft by United States fighters an act of aggression against our friendly country and brother nation of Libya. We condemn this military action and believe that this sort of mad behavior is motivated by imperialism's fear of people's awakening consciousness.\n315.\tThe division of Korea, in spite of its long history and ancient culture, is another regrettable phenomenon for the people and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We believe that the division of Korea and the prevention of Korean unity are a direct result of interference and the influence of world imperialism, headed by the United States, and we condemn all such interference.\n316.\tIn our world today, unjust and unbalanced economic relations continue to exist, and the gap between the poor and the rich is becoming wider in spite of all sorts of international conferences, meetings and gatherings.\n317.\tOur recommendation to third world countries is to trust in God Almighty, to rely on the genuine power of their people, and to rise and fight world imperialism, which has dominated and oppressed their nations economically, politically and culturally. Only in this manner can the third world countries succeed in bringing about political and economic changes without any fear of the oppressive Powers of the world, move towards their true politico-economic independence and take proper steps in meeting their basic economic and technological needs without any dependence on industrialized, developed countries.\n318.\tWe further believe that the oppressed countries of the world should use their oil and other 'subterranean resources as weapons against imperialism and other power hungry circles in the world. Contrary to the' propaganda of imperialist countries, if the destructive weapons of the superPowers can be used for the annihilation of humanity and for dominating mankind, our oil and other material weapons could be employed for the liberation of billions of human beings from the yoke of the superPowers.\n319.\tWe deem it necessary to explain here the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding international organizations and their potential for solving the problems of the oppressed. In our opinion, these international organizations, instead of serving as a means of combat against tyranny and oppression, or as a medium for establishing peace and justice in the world, have turned mainly into centers for \\\"give and take\\\" between the superPowers and a cover for the implementation of their policies. The restrictions imposed upon the present Iranian delegation to the United Nations by the United States Government serve as an up-to-date example of its domination of international affairs. The United States Government refused to issue entry visas to two Deputy Ministers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran on fictitious grounds. We were also warned that if we were to fly an Iranian aircraft, it might be seized at New York Airport. Therefore, we remain faithful to our opinion that so long as the United Nations does not liberate itself from the influence of the superPowers, and so long as it does not serve the oppressed nations of the world, which form the majority of its members, the Organization cannot be expected to be able to carry out in full the obligations and duties assigned to it by its Charter. As a first step towards the liberation of the United Nations, it is urgent to move United Nations Headquarters to an impartial country and to abolish the right of veto enjoyed by powerful Governments.\n320.\tIn conclusion, as a representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I announce to the oppressed and the deprived in the world that today a billion Moslems are rising up throughout the world and that Islam is once again bringing its blessed liberating forces to the world scene, and our faith tells us that the movement of this ocean of oppressed humanity will destroy world imperialism headed by the Great Satan, the United States of America.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is a particular pleasure for me to convey to you my warm congratulations on your assumption of the important responsibility of presiding over the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to greet you as a distinguished representative of Iraq, a country with which Romania is developing close relations of friendship and cooperation.\n80.\tThe present session begins its work in circumstances of continuing tension in international life, which gives rise to profound and legitimate concern among all peoples. The international climate is marked by an intensification of the imperialist policy of force and diktat, of consolidation and a further division of spheres of influence and domination, by the maintenance of hotbeds of conflict and war in various parts of the world, by the sharpening of the contradictions between States and groups of States, by the escalation and renewal of the arms race and by the widening of the gaps between the poor and the rich countries, against the background of the most profound economic crisis since the Second World War.\n81.\tAll peoples and the United Nations are now confronted with urgent tasks requiring extraordinary responsibility. The President of Romania has in this regard pointed out that in the present international circumstances the most pressing need today consists in bringing about unity and ever closer cooperation of peoples, of progressive forces everywhere, for the purpose of putting an end to the exacerbation of the international situation and resuming and continuing the policy of detente, independence and peace in order to stop the arms race and embark on disarmament, first of all nuclear disarmament.\n82.\tIn the spirit of these imperatives, Romania has been taking an active part in international life and is acting to promote the settlement, in the interest of all peoples, of the major problems confronting mankind. In his frequent political contacts, as well as in international forums, the head of the Romanian State, President Nicolae Ceausescu, has been promoting assiduously and on the basis of principle the ideals of cooperation and understanding among States, mutual respect, uniting the efforts of all nations for the complete elimination from interState relations of the use or threat of force and interference in the internal affairs of other States, for the defense of the freedom and independence of peoples and for the strengthening of international peace and security.\n83.\tWe are developing broad relations of friendship and cooperation wUh all socialist States. We are expanding our relations with the developing countries and with the nonaligned nations and, in the spirit of peaceful coexistence, we are promoting relations of cooperation with all States of the world, regardless of their social system.\n84.\tRomania bases its relations with all countries on the principles of full equality of rights, respect for national independence and sovereignty, noninterference in the internal affairs of States, mutual advantage and non-use of force or the threat of force, and is working actively to bring about a generalization of those principles throughout international life, convinced as it is that this is the only appropriate basis for developing relations among States and for promoting detente, security and peace.\n85.\tIn the present circumstances, the key to the resumption of the policy of detente, confidence and cooperation between nations is the undertaking of effective and substantive disarmament measures, which is the radical means of eliminating the main sources of confrontation and the danger of war, and relieving the peoples of the heavy burden of military expenditures. It is also the way to allocate vast resources for solving problems relating to the progress of each country and for substantially increasing the assistance given to the developing countries. It is the basic means of achieving a healthier political climate in the world, accelerating economic and social development, and increasing the wellbeing of all peoples.\n86.\tMankind is understandably disappointed at the sterility of so many of the negotiations which have taken place in recent years and which have resulted in resolutions on disarmament, while the arms race itself, far from slowing down, has been given new and powerful momentum. Military budgets are at record levels, and the new types and systems of weapons that are being perfected introduce additional elements of destabilization. All this feeds the infernal cycle of action and reaction, increases the risks of the outbreak of a nuclear conflict and complicates negotiations on the limitation of armaments and on disarmament.\n87.\tIt is only too obvious that the arms escalation has brought mankind to an impasse and that to escape from it requires a new, courageous approach that will lead to the achievement of a military balance, not through the piling up of armaments but through a continuing and systematic reduction of military expenditures, armed forces and armaments, through resolute measures for disarmament under effective control and, above all, through the final elimination of nuclear weapons. The peoples of the world are convinced that the unprecedented accumulations of arms is not directed to the defence of peace, but in fact represents preparations for war. If there is a genuine wish for peace, and for stability and confidence to prevail in the world, the efforts of all must be constantly subordinated to the urgent need to enter without delay into effective negotiations for the cessation of the arms race and disarmament, and first and foremost, nuclear disarmament.\n88.\tAs a European country, Romania is particularly concerned at the accumulation on our continent of the most powerful arsenal of military forces and modern armaments ever recorded, including nuclear weapons. It is in Europe that the two military alliances are confronting each other, and many of the contradictions and conflicts existing in the world today have their origin on the European continent.\n89.\tEurope, which is already saturated with armed forces and armaments, is inescapably caught up in the whirlwind of the arms race. Consequently, Romania believes that it is particularly important for the General Assembly to come out firmly against the deployment and development of new medium-range nuclear missiles, and for a beginning to be made as soon as possible on specific negotiations to banish those missiles, and nuclear weapons in general, from our continent. Romania believes that all European States with a vital interest in this question should take part in those negotiations.\n90.\tWe vigorously oppose the production of the neutron bomb, which is in fact also intended for Europe. Generally speaking, we consider it an illusion to believe that security can be achieved through the constant accumulation of new arms, since experience itself has shown that weapons, particularly nuclear weapons, bring only insecurity.\n91.\tRomania attaches particular importance to a successful outcome of the current Madrid meeting that would lead to free and extensive economic, technological, scientific and cultural cooperation on the basis of respect for the social system of each country and the independence and sovereignty of every people and would help to forge a united Europe in which every nation could develop freely, without any aggression or interference from outside. At the same time, we must ensure the continuity of the process of building security and developing cooperation on the continent. It is precisely in taking into account the existing situation in Europe, and the fact that about 80 per cent of world armament expenditures are accounted for by States signatories of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed at Helsinki, that Romania believes it is of the utmost importance for the Madrid meeting to agree on convening a conference devoted to the strengthening of confidence and to disarmament in Europe, a conference which would become an essential element in an effective disarmament process.\n92.\tIn the present international circumstances, Romania believes that the most urgent and important task is the freezing and reduction of military expenditures, on the basis of appropriate agreements and under adequate international control. To that end, Romania has proposed that principles be worked out to govern the reduction of military expenditures, a proposal which is already before the Disarmament Commission. In our view, the formulation and adoption of such principles as soon as possible would facilitate the negotiation of specific agreements to reduce military budgets. The Romanian Government believes that it would be a particularly positive step if at this session an understanding were reached on the freezing of military expenditures at the 1981 level.\n93.\tIn the debate and in the resolutions that will be adopted at this session, priority should be given to the problems of nuclear disarmament. Romania believes that we must make every effort to unblock the present situation, and that the Geneva Committee on Disarmament should begin without delay effective negotiations on the cessation of the nuclear arms race and the reduction of nuclear weapons.\n94.\tRomania regards as well-founded and just the proposal made by the Soviet delegation from the rostrum of the Assembly [7th meeting, para. 116] that anyone who is the first to use atomic weapons would be declared a criminal. Anyone who makes preparations for the use of atomic weapons against other States is in fact pursuing a policy against mankind, a criminal policy. Such a policy must.be resisted with the utmost vigor by all peoples and should be considered a crime against mankind. The peoples of the world must take action now, before it is too late, to stop the progress towards the use of that weapon. Romania therefore considers that everything possible should be done to put an end to the manufacture of nuclear weapons, which represents a serious danger to peace and mankind.\n95.\tRomania believes that the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, to be held in 1982; is of particular importance. At that session the Assembly will have the task of adopting a comprehensive disarmament program and of bringing about a radical change in the situation in the field of disarmament negotiations.\n96.\tThe supreme duty of the Governments of all States is to heed the voice of the peoples, a voice which is being \\\"raised ever more firmly against the danger of war and is demanding an end to the accumulation of armaments and the production and deployment in their countries of new nuclear weapons. It is our duty to tell the peoples of the world openly the whole truth, and not to permit the creation of any illusion that one can live in tranquility and security as long as the vast accumulations of the means of destruction continue to grow. The unprecedented dimensions of the arms race pose a particularly grave threat to world peace and to the security and life of the peoples of the world, making it necessary for all States to show responsibility, lucidity and realism.\n97.\tIn the interest of civilization, the safeguarding of life on earth and present and ^future generations, we must turn from words to deeds and act before it is too late to call a halt to this dangerous development, and we must do everything in our power to stop the arms race and embark resolutely on disarmament, above all, nuclear disarmament, Let us see to it that human genius, science and technology as was stressed, incidentally, at the recent international scientific meeting \\\"Scientists and Peace\\\", in Bucharest are used not for creating weapons, not for destructive ends, but exclusively for peaceful purposes, to accelerate the development of the least developed countries, to solve energy and food problems and for the economic and social progress of all peoples.\n98.\tThe statesmen of our time will win for themselves a worthy place in history not by an irrational armaments policy, but by the courage and determination with which they act to bring about the cessation of the arms race and by their contribution to solving this crucial problem that is facing mankind.\n99.\tIn view of the grave political and social I problems facing mankind as a result of the persistence of the phenomenon of underdevelopment and the many structural crises affecting the world economy, a firm commitment by mankind to an effective reversal of present tendencies in order to ensure the limitation of armaments, and the adoption of specific measures of disarmament, emerges as a task of particular urgency.\n100.\tIn strict solidarity with other developing countries and as a developing country, Romania continues to work for the establishment of a new international economic order.\n101.\tUnfortunately, so far very little has been done to satisfy this aspiration of the majority of mankind. The gaps between the developed and developing countries constantly grow wider and the state of underdevelopment is perpetuated, which breeds serious economic anomalies at the world level, and mistrust, animosity and tension in international life.\n102.\tIn these circumstances, the present economic, energy, monetary and financial crises are having a profound effect on development and world economic and political stability, exerting a very powerful negative effect on the economy of all States, particularly the developing countries. As has been stressed during the course of the present debate by high-level representatives of other States who have preceded me at this rostrum, an important role in the perpetuation and aggravation of this situation is being played by the unprecedented increases in the cost of international credit and by exchange rate policies. Artificially inflated interest rates have had a powerful negative impact, above all on the economies of the developing countries, aggravating the dimensions of their external debt, diminishing their already limited possibilities for development and undermining their efforts to overcome underdevelopment. Furthermore, those excessively high interest rates are affecting developed countries as well, causing the stagnation of production, investments and exports, as well as an increase in unemployment and a decline in the standard of living of the masses.\n103.\tThe international community must act with the utmost determination to put an end to these practices of force, plunder, oppression and exploitation which, in effect, are expressions of neocolonialism, pursuing in new forms, more refined but as painful as the old ones, perpetuation of the exploitation of the weak by the strong and the enrichment of advanced States at the expense of the others. It is imperative, in our view, to introduce the practice of reasonable interest rates, bearing in mind that widening the existing gaps is detrimental to the rich States themselves, since it causes the world market to shrink, endangers general progress in which all States have a vital interest, creates instability and makes even sharper already existing international contradictions. In Romania's view, we must bring about an international understanding that the ceiling of interest rates will not exceed 8 per cent. For developing countries, that ceiling should be about 5 per cent; and the least developed countries should be granted credits without interest, or with a maximum interest rate of 2 to 3 per cent.\n104.\tIn proposing a maximum interest rate of 8 per cent, we realize that this is particularly high when compared with the normal return on economic projects and, at the same time, that financial relations and international credit should not constitute an obstacle to the progress of each country and of international cooperation but, rather, should be a powerful instrument for the stimulation of material production, the expansion of commercial exchange and the promotion of economic, technological and scientific cooperation among nations. Considering the special role played in economic life by international credit and the gravity of the problem of the external debt of developing countries, the General Assembly at this session should issue an appeal to all the Governments of developed countries and to international financial cooperation organizations urgently to take measures to ensure the implementation of a reasonable system of interest rates within the limits I have mentioned.\n105.\tThe Romanian Government believes that in order to implement the new international economic order it is essential to establish new principles of equality and economic cooperation, to eliminate all forms of inequality and oppression, to eliminate the neo-colonialist practices which have the effect of perpetuating the exploitation of peoples, to ensure equitable exchange and to give more substantial support to the least developed countries for the development of the forces of production in both agriculture and industry. At the same time, there must be better access to modern technology and to the conquest of science, in advantageous conditions for the developing countries; we must abandon the trend towards using technological and scientific monopolies to institute new forms of exploitation and dependence, and to exert political and economic pressures in international relations. The efforts of each people an essential factor in an accelerated economic and social development must be blended harmoniously with broad international cooperation, primarily among the developing countries.\n106.\tFurthermore, problems of underdevelopment and of the new international economic order cannot be solved by superficial measures. Without courage and the will to make decisive progress and advance rapidly towards that goal, mankind will not be able to overcome the grave crisis it is suffering from at present. The solution of these problems necessitates fundamental changes in international economic relations and the allocation of substantial sums for economic and social development, funds which can be obtained primarily by the reduction of military expenditures.\n107.\tThe cessation of the arms race and the inauguration of disarmament would make it possible to save vast financial resources which could be allocated to economic and social development, to assist developing countries and to improve the wellbeing of peoples. Romania's President has already made specific proposals along those lines with regard to the gradual reduction of military expenditures over the next four or five years by at least 10 per cent to 15 per cent. Half of the sums saved in that way could be used for the economic and social development of the countries which have made those savings and the other half for the progress of the developing countries.\n108.\tThe Romanian Government believes that, in the process of eliminating underdevelopment and establishing normal functioning of the world economy, the developed countries have a legal \\\"and moral obligation to support the progress of the developing countries. This obligation stems primarily from the fact that during the long period of colonial domination vast riches found their way to the metropolitan countries. Furthermore, as Romania sees it, it is in the interest of the rich States themselves to participate in the liquidation of underdevelopment, since it is only in that way that the stability of the world economy and their own future progress can be achieved.\n109.\tIn our view, the United Nations is the most appropriate framework for undertaking firm and effective measures to improve the state of the world economy and assist the efforts of developing countries. The prompt initiation within the framework of the United Nations of the global negotiations proposed by the Group of 77 remains an objective of fundamental importance which could both meet the short-term and longterm interests of world economic stability and ensure the development of all countries.\n110.\tThe intensification of efforts to bring about the settlement by exclusively peaceful means of all disputes between States is a fundamental prerequisite for peace and detente and for the relaxation of tensions. Recourse to arms, force or the threat of force in dealing with disputes between States causes great damage and suffering to the peoples concerned and, at the same time, poses immense dangers to world peace. There is no denying, and experience has often confirmed this, that the use of force automatically engenders force. The time will never return when peoples of the world could be brought to their knees without resistance, when world public opinion remained passive in the face of acts of force committed by the strong against the weak. The recourse to military means or to other kinds of force in any part of the world creates tension and anxiety and gives rise to reactions on the part of all countries.\t ;\n111.\tThe Romanian Government is firmly convinced that there is no problem or controversy anywhere in the world that could not be settled by political means,' through negotiations conducted in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect. As stated by President Ceausescu\n\\\"There is no reason for peoples to have recourse to arms in order to settle differences. On the contrary, the interests of all peoples and the general interests of peace itself require that all disputes between States be settled solely through negotiation There is \\\"only one reason that can justify recourse to arms: a people's need to defend its national^ independence and its right to a free life. We must do everything possible to ensure that nobody can attempt any longer to quell the independence of peoples or subjugate them.\\\"\n112.\tWe consider that in the present international circumstances the United Nations should give priority to action against recourse to force or the threat of force, to ensure the complete renunciation of the use of military means for the settlement of international problems.\n113.\tIn proposing, at the thirty-fourth session, the inclusion in the agenda of the General Assembly of an item entitled \\\"Settlement by peaceful means of disputes between States\\\" [item 122], Romania was in fact proceeding from the need to exploit the possibilities provided by the United Nations and the Charter for more' vigorous and effective action to prevent and settle conflicts between States on a just and lasting basis. We appreciate what has been done so far with a view to producing the declaration on the peaceful settlement of disputes and believe that the timeliness and important political significance of such a declaration require a continuation of efforts in order to accelerate its implementation.\n114.\tThe Romanian initiative concerning the development and strengthening of good-neighborliness between States, which was included in the agenda of this session as item 57, also falls under the heading of the strengthening of international security and the prevention of disagreements and tension between States. I wish to stress in this regard too Romania's ceaseless efforts to develop relations of cooperation and friendship with all Balkan States, and to transform the Balkans into a nuclear weapon-free zone, a zone of friendship, peace and good neighborliness which would contribute to the security of the European continent and to the peace of the entire world.\n115.. Romania wishes to stress the active role that should be played by the United Nations in eliminating hotbeds of tension and conflict which more than once have endangered world peace and security.\n116. The Romanian Government believes that all disputes that still exist in the Middle East, SouthEast Asia, SouthWest Asia, Africa and other parts of the world should be settled by negotiation, with respect for the freedom and independence of each people and its sacred right to independent development through progress and civilization, without any outside interference.\n1!7. Our country favors a comprehensive political settlement of the Middle East conflict and the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the area, on the basis of the withdrawal by Israel from the Arab territories occupied as a result of the 1967 war; the solution of the problem of the Palestinian people by recognizing its legitimate rights, including its right to self-determination and the creation of its own independent State; and the guaranteeing of the independence and sovereignty of all States of the region. The continuation of the tension in the Middle East, aggravated by Israel's recent military actions on the territory of Lebanon, as well as by its bombardment of the Iraqi nuclear research center near Baghdad, is an impediment to the peaceful settlement of the conflict.\n118.\tRomania believes that the General Assembly must endorse effective measures to ensure a lasting peace in the Middle East and the convening of an international conference under the auspices and with the active participation of the United Nations, in which all countries concerned, as well as the Palestine Liberation Organization jPLO], the Soviet Union and the United States would take part, along with other States which can make a positive contribution to a comprehensive settlement of the situation in that part of the world and to a solution of the Palestinian problem.\n119.\tWe give every support to the constant and constructive efforts and proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to fulfill the legitimate aspirations of the Korean nation to, live in a free, united, independent, democratic and prosperous country, which is the wish of the whole Korean people, and to create the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo.\n120.\tThere is an imperative need today for the urgent and final elimination of the vestiges of colonialism, neocolonialism and racism. Romania gives its unstinting support to the struggle of the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [5W4PO], to abolish the illegal occupation of Namibia and to achieve, without delay, its sacred right freely to choose the path of its future development, in accordance with its own legitimate aspirations and interests. The Roumanian Government resolutely condemns the policy of\nracism and apartheid of those in power in Pretoria towards the African population, as well as their armed attacks against neighboring African countries and their aggression against Angola. We demand that all military actions against the independence and sovereignty of the People's Republic of Angola be halted unconditionally.\n121.\tWe are particularly attentive to the problems of social development, human rights and freedoms, the human condition in general and international cooperation in these fields. In our opinion, the concern in these areas, within the framework of the United Nations, should focus on solution of the fundamental problems of mankind and on ensuring essential rights the elimination of exploitation and of major social differences, the equitable distribution of income among the various social classes, the guaranteeing of the right to work and to equitable wages, particularly in circumstances of chronic unemployment in many countries, as well as the guaranteeing of the right to education and the best possible living conditions for all citizens.\n122.\tIn our view, the effective achievement of human rights implies the elimination of domination of one people by another, the abolition of colonialism, of the imperialist policy of force or threat of force, and the creation of a world of peace without arms or wars. The danger of a conflagration which could lead to the destruction of life on our planet emphasizes the elementary truth that the right to life, security and peace, the right to live in freedom away from the threat of aggression, represents a fundamental right of all peoples.\n123.\tRomania believes that particular attention should be paid to the growing concern of the United Nations about the problems of young people in the light of their role in the life of modern society and in determining the future of civilization in tomorrow's world.\n124.\tIt is imperative that young people in all countries should be guaranteed the right to education and the right to work so that they can use their knowledge in activities useful to society, as well as the right to play a full part in the social and political life of their countries. The Organization and all Governments have a duty to educate the youth of the world in the spirit of the ideals of freedom and social justice, friendship and mutual respect and of the common struggle for the cause of peace and progress, and at the same time to protect the younger generations from the adverse influence of neoFascist and racist circles and the degrading impact of what have become full scale enterprises of the subculture, propagating and fomenting hatred and violence.\n125.\tThe Romanian Government therefore feels that the period of preparation for the International Youth Year, to be held in 1985, should be used for stepping up the efforts of Governments to solve the specific problems of the younger generation. In this regard, we believe that the draft program of measures and activities drawn up by the Advisory Committee for the International Youth Year [see A/36/215, annex, sect. IV, pari annex to decision 1 (I)) is comprehensive and represents a real strategy for contributing to the identification and solution of the fundamental problems which are of concern today to the younger generation, and for exploiting its creative potential. We are convinced that this draft program will receive the endorsement of the General Assembly.\n126.\tThe solution of the complex problems confronting mankind today requires the democratization of international relations, the creation of conditions for the participation in international life, on a basis of full equality, of all States, regardless of their size or social system.\n127.\tAt the present time we must act to strengthen cooperation and solidarity among the developing and non aligned countries, and the small and medium-sized countries in general, in order for them to take an active part in the settlement of existing conflicts through negotiations, the bringing about of a new international economic order and the inauguration of a genuine process of disarmament. The United Nations today offers the most appropriate framework and opportunity for finding, jointly and in a spirit of responsibility, solutions to the major problems confronting mankind.\n128.\tThe United Nations is made up of all its Member States, all of us. It is therefore up to us to act in concert and with determination to strengthen the role of the Organization in international life, so that the United Nations can establish its world political priorities and the most important objectives, as well as the practical means of achieving them, so that the aspirations of peoples will no longer be disappointed through false hopes and through grievances. The United Nations should adopt concrete measures which would be conducive to the systematic and lasting solution of the problems confronting mankind, with the participation of all States on a basis of full equality.\n129.\tExperience has shown that it is not possible for major international problems to be settled in a small group of States, however big and powerful they may be. That is why we believe that the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and the improvement and democratization of its activities, in accordance with the requirements of international life today, are of major importance if international peace and security and the development of cooperation among all nations are to be ensured.\n130.\tThe overcoming of major difficulties in international life and of grave situations of tension and conflict, the resumption and continuance of the policy of detente, national independence, security and peace, all require efforts supported by all States and an active and responsible contribution on the part of all nations.\n131.\tThe Romanian delegation, along with all other delegations, is determined to make its own contribution to the search for just and equitable solutions to the problems facing the United Nations, so that this session of the General Assembly may fulfill the expectations of peoples throughout the world and contribute to the improvement of the international situation, to the resumption and continuance of the policy of detente, independence and peace, to the cessation of the arms race and the adoption of measures of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, and to the strengthening of international peace, security and cooperation.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  Sir, I should like first to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I feel confident that the good fortune which brought you t& the General Assembly will attend the work of this body throughout the present session.\n2.\tI should like also, on behalf of the Government and people of Saint Lucia, to extend a sincere welcome to the newly independent State, and the most recent Member of the United Nations, Belize. It is a signal honor to address the congratulations of the Government and people of Saint Lucia to the Government and people of Belize who, as members of this Assembly know well, had to struggle for the last 16 years to achieve the status of independence and to take their rightful place among this family of nations. We would wish it to be known that the Government and people of Saint Lucia are at one with our fellow Governments in the Caribbean Community, of which Belize is a member, in our determination to advance and sustain the peaceful and democratic progress of our sister State, a large majority of whose nationals are our own kith and kin.\n3.\tWe also wish to congratulate the newly independent State of Vanuatu, which has taken its proper place in this family of nations.\n4.\tThe political state of the world leaves much to be desired as we mark the thirty-sixth anniversary of the United Nations. The Organization, which began as the hope of all of us, continues in that singular role for the realization of the progress of mankind in this and succeeding generations. Let us then face squarely both its strengths and its weaknesses. In so doing, we must also continually examine the forces that are working within it by analyzing both their methods and their aims. Moreover, we must attempt to determine their motivating factors in order that a clear understanding and appreciation of the role of the Organization may emerge.\n5.\tThe United Nations, while continuing to promote world peace, has not been entirely successful in implementing the principle of collective security. For small and weak States this is the only guarantee of their territorial inviolability. We pay lip service to a plethora of treaties and agreements which, while encompassing security guarantees for most of the small and weak States, are, in the final analysis, subordinate to the strategic interests of the larger and stronger States. In short, our salvation does not appear to lie within the tenets of equal consideration based on sovereignty, but rather on how we are strategically perceived by those that wish to control the world and thereby the destiny of all mankind.\n6.\tAs a result of this, the old animosities have given way to heightened tensions, continually fanned by a changing perspective, which leads to actual confrontations and consequently an escalating arms race. It is indeed a sad irony that insularity of one kind or another seems to be increasing with the growing interdependence of nations. The great historian Arnold Toynbee once observed that the cult of nationalism is now the world's major religion and that its God demands human sacrifice; but when that anachronistic attitude, which we euphemistically refer to as nationalism, is not busy fomenting wars in some otherwise peaceful area of the world, it is actively driving wedges which preclude meaningful cooperation between nation States. We in the Caribbean can speak with great authority on that issue. The cult of insularity has in the past thwarted meaningful economic and political cooperation among our impoverished islands, even though we share a common people and an identical history.\n7.\tThis explains our preference for regional groupings, groupings that give greater strength and lend further cohesion to the United Nations in the task of bringing peace and progress to the world community at large. They also lead to better understanding, close cooperation and friendship between peoples. Saint Lucia has become a member of the nonaligned group and, in addition, we spearheaded the movement which transformed the dependent group known as the West Indies Associated States into the more meaningful and internationally acceptable organization termed the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. We have realized that identity in the international community as a prerequisite for the development of our political economy can best be achieved within our regional grouping. The Government and people of Saint Lucia place great faith in that new organization. To us it is a watershed in interCaribbean relations, indeed, the beginning of a new era in Caribbean unity.\n651\nA/36/PV.32\n8.\tBut in that context we are equally a part of the Caribbean Community, that clearly distinctive, English-speaking subregion of Latin America. It is there that our affinity and involvement is most marked. That is why we look with measured concern and reluctant approbation at the new thrust for the concept of the Caribbean Basin.\n9.\tWe wish to establish firmly, from the outset, that we do not consider ourselves perched on the periphery of the so-called Caribbean Basin, there to gain merely peripheral advantages from those in whose interest it is to secure that Basin. If the idea of a Basin is to have any validity, if it is to ensure the interests of its benefactors, then that, in our view, can only be done by first securing the enlightened self-interest of all the occupants of that Basin. Moreover, ensuring the material advancement and well being of all the peoples of our small island States in that Basin must be given special attention, since in the broad perspective of history those small islands have always been the first safeguard of those benefactors.\nA\n10.\tThe Government and people of Saint Lucia fully support the removal of the arbitrary line which has separated the proud people of the Korean peninsula for over three and a half decades. While the United Nations, inter alia, has traditionally been intimately involved in the Korean question, the General Assembly since 1976 has agreed that the question of reunification, consistent with the principle of the right to self-determination, must be left to the Korean people themselves. The Korean peninsula should not be a focal point where EastWest tensions are played out. Reunification in today's world is not merely a lofty ideal but a most practical aspiration.\n11.\tSaint Lucia supports the sovereignty, territorial integrity and, indeed, nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus. While we do not in any way underestimate the obstacles to be surmounted, we believe that the inter-communal talks at present kept under the purview of the Sec. retaryGeneral, with the consent of the Security Council, can be a medium for a just and lasting solution only if they are conducted in a most serious and substantive manner. In calling for more serious attitudes during the inter communal talks, the Government and people of Saint Lucia reaffirm their solidarity with the Government and people of Cyprus and strongly urge that without further delay a just and lasting solution be negotiated between the parties based on high-level agreements, the relevant United Nations resolutions and the declarations and decisions of the group of nonaligned countries.\n12.\tNational jealousies cannot be blamed for all of the world's ills. If nationalism is antiquated, then racism has always been idiotic. And if racism is stupid, then the apartheid practicing regime of South Africa is an affront to the dignity and intelligence of man. The people of Saint Lucia have always felt an unmitigated disgust for the apartheid system. Since independence my Government has consistently opposed any area that will court it. The continued illegal occupation of Namibia by that apartheid-practicing regime further aggravates the problem. It should now be abundantly clear that South Africa does not intend to comply with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) except, of course, if it can contrive to have its handpicked lackeys retain power. There are no logical excuses to be offered for deferring comprehensive and meaningful economic sanctions against South Africa. They must be implemented now.\n13.\tSaint Lucia welcomed the Panama Declaration and program of Action on Namibia [A/36/24, vol. I, para. 222]. It supports without reservation a total economic, political and social embargo against South Africa. We have noted and it does not augur well for the image of the United Nations that in order to obtain agreement on resolution ES8/2 adopted at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, devoted to Namibia, the most pertinent paragraphs had to be watered down to such a degree diat one wondered if that was really what a number of distinguished Foreign Ministers had come to New York to achieve. But it is not lost on the world that in every way the developing world will continue to hammer out the message that apartheid must end, and the recalcitrant countries which wish to protect South Africa will one day have to realize that their better interests are not served by their continual refusal to denounce the perpetrators of this infringement of the rights of human beings.\n14.\tThis year marks a full decade since the fraternal country of Sri Lanka later joined by others introduced in the world Organization the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. While one should have little difficulty in accepting that the process of bringing this idea to fruition would of necessity be cumulative, the lack of serious progress over the past 10 years has been most disturbing. While the security interests and realpolitik considerations of the great Powers made this concept idealistic, even quixotic, we none the less believe that it is time for its realization. Tensions in the Middle East and SouthEast Asia, including possible threats to economic desiderata in the Persian Gulf, continue to prove a hindrance to the disarming of the Indian Ocean. Recent events continue to show that the balance of terror in the Indian Ocean is no deterrent to aggression in the area. Saint Lucia firmly supports the idea of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.\n15.\tIt also continues to advocate that this concept be extended to the Caribbean region as well, because if present trends continue, sooner or later we in the Caribbean will be facing situations more difficult than anything imagined at present. We have focused our plea for a zone of peace in our regional institutions with remarkable success. We now wish it to be heard and projected within this world forum. \n16.\tIt is our view that economic aid alone will not significantly alter the instability in an area which is being held back by economic stagnation. No investor will wish to move into a region full of military movements and maneuvers. We have stated in every forum open to us that, in order to raise the standard of living of our peoples, we need to have a massive injection of investments and assistance; further, that if States continue to destabilize our area with the movement of their armed forces, the climate for economic development and progress will be destroyed. Our voice may be a cry in the wilderness, but we are convinced that it is a wilderness on which this august institution would be well advised to focus more attention. If we do not find the satisfaction of our interests in the Organization, if the developed world pays no heed to our real needs, and if we only vaunt an empty sovereignty whose value is determined by the interests of our larger neighbors, then is this not an invitation to take our salvation into our own hands, even at the risk of violating the Charter of the United Nations which we all hold sacred, and find the solution in whatever form or fashion satisfies our needs?\n17. As a small island State, Saint Lucia interprets the principle of nonalignment quite literally. While we have our own notions about the kind of political and economic system in which we ourselves would prefer to live, we are, for all essential purposes, respectful of the existence of various preferences and their justifications. We have, in terms of consistent policy, maintained good relations with all friendly nations and, in line with our acceptance of the ideological plurality of the world, we intend to expand our political intercourse to all States, regardless of their political persuasion. However, we wish to repeat here that we will not countenance or consort with South Africa or similar apartheidpractising States.\n18! In 1979, when we entered the world stage, we were encouraged to enter forums that considered matters of vital interest to us. Hitherto such interests had been taken care of by a former metropolitan Power. Such was the case, for example, of the questions concerning the law of the sea. Since 1974 the nations of the world have been hard at work, seeking to formulate a convention to put some order in the regime of the sea. Even at that late stage in 1979, Saint Lucia sought to have its interests registered. We have held off from seeking to advance solely our own interests, however important and vital they may have been, because we felt and were encouraged to believe that it was the wish of other important States that one should not rock the boat or disturb the balance of the package.\n19.\tWe have sought through bilateral means to secure our maritime areas, especially those that are in relation to other friendly and cooperative States, and in this regard we cite the Agreement on Delimitation of the Saint Lucian Channel, signed in Paris in March of this year, between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of Saint Lucia. The Agreement is an example of what can be achieved between a metropolitan Power that shows good will and understanding of a small State's problem and an island State which is prepared to cooperate while having regard to its own national interests. From this basis it is expected that many further avenues of cooperation and coordination will open up.\n20.\tOur major concern with the law of the sea is mainly with the question of pollution and that of control over the waters surrounding our island State with respect to the passage of foreign ships. For us, pollution is a nightmare from which there is no awakening. We say categorically in this forum that the present Agreement does not adequately prevent the possibilities of pollution. It does not go far enough. It is therefore necessary that we seek to advance our ideals at the next session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, since the actions of other States appear to reopen the entire package for renewed negotiations. If the Conference is now seeking to renegotiate the package, then it is logical that every area should come under renewed scrutiny. We \\\" will also seek assistance from the international institutions whose work is related to the law of the sea. Some have indicated their willingness to aid in solving our pollution problems, but we still have not seen any implementation in terms of their letter of intent; this, unfortunately, is the weakness of international institutions. We are therefore left to turn for assistance to those States that may be willing to help us on a bilateral basis but whose particular interests may well be at variance with our own.\n21.\tWith the adoption, on 5 December 1980, of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [resolution 35/56], it was considered that the next phase that of global negotiations to implement the Strategy would follow. Unfortunately, there are interests that have decided not to undertake global negotiations at this particular time, and the issue is now in limbo. We know that the economic picture around the world continues to deteriorate and worsens with every passing day. We are thus forced into an economic position that is reflected in a deteriorating state of affairs which, as time passes, makes us more susceptible to accepting the lowest common denominator in terms of trade. What we are aware of is that the evident failure or lack of purpose in coming to grips with the global economy negates any attempt to bring peace and security to this world and thereby undermines the chances for small States to achieve the economic development and progress to which we all aspire.\n22.\tHowever, the picture is not all bleak and disconsolate. We must readily commend the efforts of the participants in the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held at Cancun. They will perhaps provide more positive results in the near future. We believe that some exchange of ideas is worthwhile and may serve to engender a better understanding of some of the problems. We welcome the initiative of the four sponsors of the Meeting and we are playing our part by making the necessary financial sacrifices to attend those costly meetings in order that we may be able to present,a proper economic package for their acceptance and implementation. But we cannot help thinking that we are voters in the constituency of rhetoric, for we have little to show by way of development in certain sectors of our infrastructure. This is particularly so as those very sponsors continually point to that as the reason for our inability to absorb the aid and investment which could alleviate our economic circumstances. It is a vicious circle and we look apprehensively at the unfolding of the plans to remedy this malaise. There is no small island State to adequately convey our problems as we see them or to be in a position to take the word to those that may give in terms consonant with a small island State's interests.\n23.\tGlobal negotiations must lead to a substantial change in the economic regime established after the Second World War. It is our hope that all countries will participate, regardless of their economic standing and social structures, in bringing about a more equitable and just system and that the guiding factor for negotiations will be the immediate improvement of the conditions of the millions for whom this planet is an unrepentant executioner that ensures death by starvation.\n24.\tIn the opening statement by the Administrator of UNDP to the twenty-eighth session of the Governing Council, a very disheartening picture in our view was painted.1 The anticipated shortfall in resources was not just a projection, but rather a reality. The Administrator of UNDP noted that, whereas at the end of May 1979, 54.4 per cent of pledges for that year had been paid, by the same time in 1980 only 30.8 per cent and in 1981 a mere 17 per cent of pledges were redeemed. In fact, the Administrator indicated that changes in exchange rate parities had significantly eroded UNDP's resource base and that the target of a 14 per cent a year increase in voluntary contributions set by the Council would not be met, not only for one year, but for the entire cycle 19821986.\n25.\tThe developing countries have come to rely heavily on UNDP assistance in their efforts to meet the developmental aspirations of their peoples. The importance which developing countries attach to UNDP can be seen simply by an examination of their own contributions to the program. For the past year contributions from the developing countries have continued to increase, even though there have not been any significant increases in growth in their national economies. Had other countries taken up the challenge, the^ 19821986 cycle would have been in a healthier position. At a time when the overall economic picture is gloomy, we cannot allow the one glimmer of hope to fade. Saint Lucia strongly urges the donor countries to continue their support for UNDP through increased contributions and the prompt payment of these contributions. The efforts of UNDP in our development process are too critical to be neglected and allowed to flounder. It is of paramount importance that we, in the developing countries, plan as efficiently as possible the programs and projects that will assist us in bettering out livelihood. But that planning is only possible when the sources of financing are assured. Taken together, proper planning and availability of funds will result in maximum utilization and efficient use of resources, and this assumes greater importance when these resources are already in short supply.\n26.\tIt is necessary to point out that, apart from the. country programs directly administered by UNDP, there are a number of special funds and activities supervised by UNDP personnel or dependent on the UNDP field network for their operation. These will also be seriously affected, resulting in an acrosstheboard decrease in activities and efficiency. This situation should not be allowed to arise. We repeat that it is therefore important in our view that all .donor countries increase as much as possible their contribution to the program and make those pledged sums available at the beginning of the year. Only in this way can developing countries achieve the program envisaged in decision\\\" 80/30,2 which has been hailed as a positive step and through which the developing countries can be sure of continued assistance in their efforts towards self-reliance and economic liberation.\n27.\tIn looking at those programs, we wish to express our concern and apprehension over the thinking that underlies the distribution of those funds and, for that matter, the way the funds are deployed in any particular country's program. There is an increasing tendency to think that assistance is being rendered by sending experts to the developing world. We do not entirely share that view. This is not to say that experts do not have an important role to play in our countries. But it is the consideration that experts are the be-all and end-all of the solution that causes us concern. The dispatch of experts, absorbing the better proportion of available funds, in fact hinders the receiving countries from developing the necessary technical skills and expertise in their indigenous personnel which are useful and perhaps vital for the longterm development of the country. It also gives the impression that the institution is serving simply as a clearing house and employment agency for some entrenched persons and friends. We need to reverse this trend and redirect our efforts towards the training of persons from the developing world; towards reducing the administrative costs of the implementation of projects; towards increased participation in the decision-making process in projects designed for our countries; and towards projects that are meaningful and practical within the developmental framework of the country concerned. If those provisions are satisfied, then the assistance will be truly meaningful.\n28.\tThe program of Action adopted at the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries held at Caracas [see AI36/333 and Corr. 1], calls for cooperative efforts among developing countries in the areas of trade, technology, food and agriculture, energy, raw materials, finance and industrialization. These are the areas in which the developed countries should treat with the developing world within the context of the global negotiations. We regard economic cooperation among developing countries as an integral part of the collective action of the Group of 77 to restructure international economic relations and as an indicator that we have taken the initiative. In our intra-economic relations we have attempted to develop mechanisms that will prevent any small group of States within the Group of 77 to gain a position of dominance, and we have ensured that the most disadvantaged in our ranks will obtain the special consideration necessary for their development. It is in this same vein that we perceive the global negotiations.\n29.\tWe sincerely believe that economic relations among States must be based on the principles of equity, interdependence and justice. We are committed to observing these principles in our own interrelations, and we will expect their observance in our dealings with the developed world. Economic cooperation among developing countries should therefore serve as a springboard from which the world can attain higher goals and standards.\n30.\tAs early as 1976, the peculiar difficulties of island developing countries were recognized by UNCTAD and a program of action in terms of assistance was agreed upon in resolution 98 (IV).3 That program extended over the entire gamut of development, in particular in terms of assistance to trade promotion efforts, investment in infrastructure namely, water, electricity, transport, industrial estates, etc. and assistance in strengthening the capacity of island developing States to negotiate with foreign investors. These measures were to assist the island developing States to overcome problems caused by their remoteness from market centers, the smallness of their own domestic markets, their low resource endowment and their dependence on only a few export commodities.\n31.\tToday the newly independent Member States and those on the threshold of independence are mainly island developing States. These recent Members are probably in greater difficulty than their forerunners, having to face a world economy which, in our view, is hovering on the brink of depression. It is this very institution that has championed political independence and self-determination, enabling our States to assume membership. We believe that it now has an obligation to assist us in achieving economic independence. We therefore urge that the economic goodwill to complement the political achievements must not only be present but must be visibly present. Efforts must be made by the United Nations system, by the multilateral assistance institutions and by respective Governments that are in a position to do so to increase their assistance to island developing countries so that they, in turn, may maintain the climate for investments and the growth rates which they have demonstrated themselves capable of achieving through their own efforts.\n32.\tFew island developing States qualify under the existing criteria as least developed States. Yet, in some cases, their situation may be worse. That is a dilemma of most of the island developing countries, and unless the special measures called for in UNCTAD resolutions 98 (IV) of 19763 and resolution 111 (V) of 19794 are carried through, some developing countries may automatically deserve to be reclassified and thereby qualify as least developed States because of a worsening economic situation.\n33.\tMy Government is particularly concerned at the apparent lack of interest in the welfare and wellbeing of some of the less fortunate States of the Organization. Last year, following the near devastation of our country by hurricane Allen, which caused considerable damage to crops, housing, industry and infrastructure, we were able to get a resolution adopted by this body for increased assistance to Saint Lucia. That resolution 35/101, was adopted on 5 December 1980 and called for the mobilization of the financial, technical and economic assistance of the international community and the United Nations system to meet the short and longterm needs of the State. The appropriate sum of money which would enable a special mission to visit Saint Lucia to consult with the Government on the best possible modes to undertake the operation was approved by the Fifth Committee.\n34.\tUnfortunately, no action was taken on this until September this year, over one year after the hurricane disaster. To date, a report on how this mobilization will be effected has not been issued. This shows either a considerable lack of interest or an arrogant disregard on the part of those who are charged with this responsibility. It does not speak well for the manner in which the administrative area of this body fulfills its obligations.\n35.\tGiven the critical political and economic situation which now faces the world community, some of which we have tried to highlight today, we in Saint Lucia still dare to be optimistic, still date to live in hope. We are hopeful because when we look at the long and turbulent history of man we see that the greatest leap forward has always been achieved in the midst of the greatest adversity.\n36.\tWe have already formulated and agreed upon preliminary proposals, on a regional basis, for an improvement in food production, better terms of trade and the procurement of finance.\n37.\tWe have listened with interest to the commitment expressed at the Assembly by many nations, and we have reason to feel that in the end good sense and logic will prevail and that the integrity of the United Nations as an instrument of peace shall be preserved. This is our wish, this is our hope, this is our prayer.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "252.\t The delegation of the People's Republic of Benin, which we have the honor of heading, wishes to address to Mr. Kittani its warm congratulations and to express its complete satisfaction at his election to the office of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly: His election is a confirmation of his exceptional qualities as an experienced diplomat and is a tribute to his country, Iraq, for its role in international affairs. My delegation, which is particularly happy to emphasize here the high quality of the relations of active solidarity that exist between his country, the Republic of Iraq, and our own, the People's Republic of Benin, remains convinced that under his enlightened guidance our discussions will be conducted in lucid serenity, which alone can make it possible for us to examine objectively the numerous and grave problems with which our world is faced.\n253.\tMy delegation also wishes to express its appreciation for the manner in which his predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, conducted the work of the thirty-fifth session and that of the eighth emergency special session, devoted to Namibia.\n254.\tMay I also repeat our heartfelt gratitude for the remarkable work accomplished by the Secretary General. The numerous activities that he was engaged in during the past year, with his well-known dedication and tenacity, helped to further the aim of implementing the principal objectives pursued by the United Nations.\n255.\tMy delegation wishes to express its gratification at the admission of the Republic of Vanuatu and of Belize to the United Nations. We extend a warm welcome to the eminent representatives of those two new States and assure them of our solidarity, fraternity and frank cooperation.\n256.\tThe thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly offers once again at this annual review of both history and the problems of the world an exceptional opportunity to the States Members of the Organization collectively to discuss solutions and the action to be taken in order to meet some of the great hopes of peoples concerning peace, justice, prosperity and cultural fulfillment.\n257.\tsince the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly^ in spite of our resolutions, consultations and recommendations, the political and economic landscape of the world has in fact not changed very much as regards the fulfillment of our legitimate requirements of truth, freedom, peace and progress for all.\n258.\tWe are afraid that we have to state the contrary to be true. Indeed, the persistence of colonial occupation in\nSouth Africa and Namibia, the arrogance of the racist Pretoria regime in the face of the international community's pursuit of a fitting solution to the Namibian problem, the acts of provocation and aggression by South Africa against the front-line countries, the military occupation of southern Angola by South African troops, the military occupation by Morocco of Western Sahara, the pursuit of the policy of extermination and genocide by the Zionist regime of Israel in Palestine and southern Lebanon, the tensions in Asia, the subversive maneuver in Central America and the Caribbean, and the attempts at destabilizing progressive regimes are so many problems in the world which have been left pending. They are problems created, maintained and stirred up by hostile forces alien to the liberation of peoples which international imperialism and its allies are using in order better to stifle the voice and free will of the peoples of our planet.\n259.\tFaced with this grave situation, the Secretary General is quite right in stating the following in his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"How does the United Nations measure up to these great challenges of our time? I have to say that, for all our efforts and our undoubted sincerity, the Organization has not yet managed to cut through the political habits and attitudes of earlier and less hurried centuries and to come to grips decisively with these new factors of our existence. We talk about and express our anxieties and our good intentions, but we have yet to act upon the clear indications of what we are really up against.\\\" [Sec A/36/11, sect. III.]\nThe delegation of the People's Republic of Benin therefore voices its deep concern in the face of all those important problems that have been left without solution, while the international situation as a whole is preoccupying because it is fraught with threats for struggling peoples and for the prosperity of all.\n260.\tIf vetoes and blocking of the decision-making process are continued, if barriers to the application of major political and economic decisions already adopted continue to be raised, if the liberation of nations is delayed, if the independence of Namibia, self-determination for Western Sahara and for the oppressed peoples of South Africa are compromised, can the United Nations consider that it has honored the pledge it made more than a third of a century ago to rid our planet for ever of the scourges of war, injustice and famine and to build a world of peace, justice and prosperity for all?\n261.\tIf we have reasons for our deep , concern and grounds for pessimism, we do not have the right to despair, because, in addition to the Organization, the peoples of all the continents have the same deep-rooted aspirations are daily fighting for freedom, justice, progress for all and international peace and security.\n262.\tConscious of this vital reality and hope, the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin will once again this year permit itself to define its positions on certain problems on the agenda.\n263.\tSince the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia, Africa has known nothing but frustration and disappointment. How can one understand South Africa's stubbornness in opposing with all the means at its disposal the will of the international community to liberate Namibia? How can one explain the unspeakable treachery with which the neo-Nazis in power in Pretoria are making a mockery of decisions taken by the United Nations? How can one interpret the repeated dilatory maneuvers of that regime?\n264.\tThe only answer to all those questions resides in the Machiavellian designs of international imperialism to protect the racist regime of South Africa by blocking the adoption of energetic measures such as the mandatory comprehensive sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter. Thus, the triple veto of 30 April 1981 in the Security Council by the Western Powers that are permanent members of the Council, the United States veto in the Council on 31 August 19816 opposing the condemnation of Pretoria, which committed a savage act of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and invaded part of its national territory, the machinations of certain Western Powers to block the just and appropriate decisions adopted at the emergency special session on Namibia, are an objective and open show of support for the minority, fascist and racist Pretoria regime.\n265.\tThe people of Benin as a whole, its Party, the Benin People's Revolutionary Party, as well as the National Executive Council, in pursuance of decisions of the OAU, resolutions of the nonaligned movement and resolutions of the United Nations concerning the independence of Namibia, will continue to support by all possible means the legitimate struggle of the heroic Namibian people under the direction of its vanguard movement, SWAPO, its sole authentic representative.\n266.\tMy delegation calls for the effective implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and reaffirms forcefully that only comprehensive sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter will effectively help to unblock the current situation in Namibia, a situation which threatens peace and security in Africa and throughout the world.\n267.\tMy delegation wishes to pay a deserved tribute to the gallant peoples of Zambia, of Mozambique and especially of Angola for the enormous sacrifices that they are constantly making in order to halt the repeated aggression of Pretoria, which is using Namibian territory as a base for its subversive and destabilizing operations.\n268.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Benin supports Security Council resolutions 428 (1978), 447 (1979), 454 (1979) and 475 (1980) relating to the numerous armed acts of aggression, incursions and military occupation of Angolan territory by South Africa, as well as the violation of Angolan air space by the racist forces stationed in the military bases South Africa has established on Namibian territory, and calls for everything to be done to ensure that Angola obtains from South Africa \\\"payment of full and adequate compensation for the damage to life and property resulting from these acts of aggression\\\", as stipulated in Security Council resolution 475 (1980).\n269.\tMy delegation expresses the unconditional support and solidarity of the people of Benin for the heroic Angolan people and demands that South Africa witVfaw its occupying troops from Angolan territory.\n270.\tIn South Africa itself the struggle is becoming increasingly radicalized through increased awareness on the part of the oppressed black people. The terrorist Pretoria regime is leaving our brothers no other choice than a state of permanent war, resistance to slavery and rejection of bestial humiliation. The bastion of fascism and racism is arming itself and equipping itself with the most advanced military and nuclear technology. More and more it is asserting its role as faithful and indispensable ally in leading Western circles and military staff headquarters. Is not South Africa with its apartheid regime the keystone of dreams of hegemony and colonial reconquest of the African continent? Is it not a concrete expression of that \\\"broad strategic vision which places regional problems in a more global context\\\", which is so dear to international imperialism?\n271.\tThat is what complicates and aggravates the problem of the Pretoria regime. It must also increase our vigilance and give to our brothers in South Africa new reasons for organizing themselves and mobilizing by all the means available in the struggle against fascism and racism. On that honorable path the African National Congress and our brothers fighting in South Africa will find us to be as determined and as much in solidarity with them as ever.\n272.\tIn respect of Western Sahara, which is, as everyone knows, another colonial and expansionist scandal, the United Nations has already had occasion to adopt important pertinent resolutions expressing the right of that people to self-determination and independence. The question of Western Sahara remains therefore a question of decolonization, as the mission of inquiry of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the .Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples defined it in 1975.7\n273.\tThe People's Republic of Benin, which has always supported and will support to the end the struggle of the Sahraoui people under the direction of the POLISARIO* Front, its sole authentic representative, against Moroccan colonialism and expansionism and for national independence, is gratified at the decision adopted at the eighteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, which created an Implementation Committee regarding the cease fire and the referendum on self-determination [see A/36/534, annex II, resolution AHG/RES.103 (XVIII)]. The People's Republic of Benin supports that Committee in its extremely difficult and delicate efforts to ensure that the decisions adopted at Nairobi, in August 1981, will be put into effect. But it is also our duty to demand that all the conditions are met and that all guarantees are provided to the Sahraoui people in its struggle, confronting as it does all kinds of interference and attempts to turn back the clock on the part of the expansionist Moroccan forces. That is why we feel a ceasefire must be brought about as soon as possible on the basis of a negotiated agreement between the parties to the conflict, namely, the POLISARIO Front and Morocco, under the supervision of the OAU Implementation Committee. The Moroccan armed forces must withdraw from the occupied Sahraoui territory.\n274.\tIt is in that context that, in accordance with the resolution of the OAU Assembly and the decisions of the Implementation Committee, it would be desirable for the United Nations to provide the necessary assistance to ensure that the martyred Sahraoui people, at last free and independent, may undertake the task of reconstructing its country, which has been devastated by so many years of war.\n275.\tThe questions we have just reviewed are not the only ones that are of concern to our continent. We denounce and condemn foreign interference in African affairs, destabilizing armed aggression, the use of mercenaries to ignite or fan the flames of conflict between African States. In that connection, the adoption of an international convention against the use of mercenaries would provide a valuable legal weapon to combat this scourge of our times. Benin will continue to work in the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries for the full attainment of that objective, because we have lived through the painful experience of a criminal mercenary adventure in Benin on 16 January 1977.\n276.\tAs regards the Middle East, we cannot help expressing our profound concern at the turn events ate taking in that part of the world. For in southern Lebanon and in the occupied Arab territories, Israeli Zionism continues to terrorize the population and to consolidate with further settlements the unlawful annexation of territories conquered by armed aggression.\n277.\tFacts show that the signing of the separate Camp David accords has contributed to the aggravation of the crisis. The holy alliance between international imperialism and Zionism favors aggression, and the escalation of violence witnessed in that region is additional proof of that.\n278.\tIn the face of Israel's arrogance and its policy of war and terror of which the aggression against the Tamuz nuclear plant in Iraq is the most striking illustration has not the time come to seek appropriate means commensurate with the serious dangers that Zionist policy poses to the world?\n279.\tThat is why our delegation affirms that the time has come to compel Israel to respect the numerous resolutions and decisions of the United Nations on the right to self-determination and independence of the Palestinian people, its right to return to its homeland and its right to create an independent and sovereign State.\n280.\tIsrael must withdraw its troops from the occupied Arab territories. We reaffirm the support of the people of Benin for the struggle of the Arab peoples and the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the struggling Palestinian people.\n281.\tThe situation prevailing in Cyprus, a question still before the Assembly, is also a matter of concern for my country. We believe this is the right place for us to reaffirm our militant support for the courageous Cypriot people and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus in their struggle to safeguard their national independence and territorial integrity and to achieve national unity.\n282.\tIn Asia, where the intrigues of international imperialism continue to disrupt and bring bloodshed to the southeastern region, the heroic people of Kampuchea, which has for so long suffered the consequences of colonialism, neocolonialism and crimes of every sort, needs peace and freedom to take its destiny into its own hands. In its courageous struggle to safeguard its dearly bought independence and to achieve its national reconstruction, the people of Kampuchea will always have the militant support of the people of Benin. We reaffirm yet again the firm support of the Government of the People's Republic of Benin for the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea in all its efforts to consolidate and further develop its revolutionary process.\n283.\tWe condemn the unacceptable interference by international imperialism and its allies in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, which, by unleashing an all-encompassing revolution, has shaken the foundation of an age-old, powerful, oppressive feudalism and exploitation. We support the struggle of the people of democratic Afghanistan for consolidation of its revolutionary achievements.\n284.\tThe heroic people of Korea, in the difficult circumstances imposed on it by international imperialism,\nwages an unremitting struggle on both sides of the 38th parallel for the reunification of the Korean homeland. In the south in particular, despite the reemergence of barbarous repression, the determination of the people continues to challenge successive dictatorial regimes.\n285.\tWe support the positive proposals and initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a frank and direct dialog between the North and the South to attain the peaceful reunification of Korea. We condemn imperialist maneuvers relating to the \\\"two Koreas\\\" policy. We demand the withdrawal of foreign forces from the southern part of Korea so that the armistice agreement may be replaced by a peace agreement.\n286.\tWe also wish to reaffirm here the support of the People's Republic of Benin for the just struggle of the people of East Timor and its National liberation movement, FRETILIN.\n287.\tCentral America and the Caribbean Sea are for my delegation another area of concern in view of the direct and brutal interventions of international imperialism and the subversive actions against the revolutionary experiment in many of the countries of the region.\n288.\tWe support the struggles of the people of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Grenada and other Latin American countries for freedom and true emancipation. In Cuba the\nheroic resistance of an admirable people has effectively outwitted until now the open aggression, military threats and ceaseless conspiracies against the people's revolution, which is taking deep root and being firmly consolidated. The people of Puerto Rico must become the real master of its own destiny and enjoy true and full independence.\n289.\tThe People's Republic of Benin reaffirms its support for all measures and decisions aimed at making, the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. The proposals of the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar aimed at\nthe demilitarization of the Indian Ocean also have our full active support, for that southern ocean, now dangerously threatened by forces and instruments of war which are the pride of modern arsenals, must become once more a great sea of peace and peaceful cooperation.\n290.\tThe arms race represents a potential danger for mankind. It diverts towards military objectives that are destructive and have no economic value, enormous funds, resources and energy that could be devoted to the achievement of economic and social objectives.\n291.\tDespite the unceasingly repeated appeals of the General Assembly for disarmament, there has been no progress in that respect. The time has come for the participants in the arms race, of which the least that can be said is that it is inhuman, to understand the Organization, and take it and its purposes and principles, contained in the first lines of the Charter, with proper seriousness.\n292.\tThe People's Republic of Benin supports the proposal of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics concerning the request for the resumption of negotiations with the United States of America, and appeals to all the Powers engaged in the arms race to give proof of understanding and goodwill so that progress may be made ^long the path to disarmament.\n293.\tWhen, in this same Hall one year ago the global negotiations reached the deadlock of which we are all aware, paralyzed by the pitiless and intransigent increase in the egotism of certain wealthy countries, the poorest and the least developed countries of the third world, of which we are one, ceaselessly requested that an end be put to the unjust and scandalous international economic disorder.\n294.\tSince then, another important conference has been held, at Nairobi the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy a fundamental and decisive question. Soon, at Cancun, the tortuous and difficult NorthSouth dialog will endeavor to break away from diplomatic rhetoric and will, at least we hope, support the demands for a new international economic order.\n295.\tThe statistics of absolute poverty and the already very exact precise diagnosis of the serious ills besetting the world economy are there to testify on our behalf we, the \\\"damned\\\", the \\\"collective proletarians\\\" of the world. That is why we are legitimately impatient and refuse to remain silent and capitulate.\n296.\tLet those who govern the international economy, who regulate and determine the rate of exchange, who exploit our countries and drain them of primary commodities at prices fixed by them alone, at long last understand that, if disorder and injustice persist, their selfish obstinacy will result in serious social explosions. Throughout our speeches, we repeat this warning with a strength and passion which reflect the extent of our development needs.\n297.\tDoes not the quarrel about the quantitative objectives of development and the allocation of a percentage of the gross national product of the rich countries to development assistance sometimes seem but an academic exercise, at which some international experts and consultants excel, when we look in distress at the waste or at the enormous budgets devoted to the production and modernization of weapons in the industrialized countries? From time to time, of course, we are told that they understand our problems and our tragic and intolerable situation.\n298.\tBut it will not suffice for alms to be produced, palliatives to be multiplied or quick soporifics to be administered. The new international economic order must be conceived and organized in order to put an end definitively to injustice, to eliminate exploitation and to do away with the pitiless and rapacious reign of the transnational corporations.\n299.\tIt is, incidentally, with respect to this question of the establishment of a more just and equitable sew international economic order that the President of the People's Republic of Benin, Mr. Mathieu Kerekou, on 24 September last, at the 113th regular session of the meeting in Paris of the Executive Council of UNESCO, stated:\n\\\"Our wish is to see all regional, continental and international organizations, and in particular the OAU, the nonaligned movement and the United Nations, defend that noble mission, call fewer spectacular conferences which have no future, adopt fewer formal resolutions and seek instead to obtain concrete results in the light of the fact that the scourges ensuing from underdevelopment, such as famine, disease and ignorance, continue to claim millions of victims, whose number continues to grow every day.\\\"\nIt is only in this perspective that a truly just and humanitarian new international economic order can be established.\n300.\tThe new international economic order will not suffice to liberate our peoples entirely and ensure their complete development unless a new information order is also established. Furthermore, the national cultures of our countries, which have been for so long denied and denigrated, could not contribute towards the free development of our peoples either unless a new international cultural order were to be established on our very varied and rich planet.\n301.\tIt is in this context that the People's Republic of Benin had the honor to host, on 18 and 19 September last, a meeting of the ministers for culture of 34 member and associated States of the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation, coming from Africa, America, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific. The Cotonou Declaration, adopted at the close of that meeting, states that the world \\\"will riot have peace or stability unless international relations are based on bonds of equality and respect for the sovereignty of States, friendship among peoples and brotherhood among men\\\". That same Declaration affirms \\\"the fundamental importance of culture as the essential dimension of economic and social development\\\". The Declaration concludes that \\\"it is essential to recognize, respect and affirm the cultural identity of peoples and to work resolutely towards the establishment of a better balance in cultural exchange\\\".\n302.\tThis is the important economic, social, cultural and, in the last analysis, human task that the Organization has the means to carry out in peace and mutual understanding* providing that the will and the determination to see justice prevail in international relations guides us all, and that we all do our best to put into effect the fundamental principles of the Charter.\n303.\tIn conclusion, permit the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin to express its sincere gratitude to the Secretariat which, in the framework of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 35/88, on economic assistance to Benin, sent to Cotonou from 4 to 12 May 1981 an inter-agency mission under the direction of Mr. Farah, UnderSecretary General for Special Political Questions.\n304.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Benin has no doubt that the program adopted there will command the attention of the present session of the Assembly and of the international community.\n305.\tReady for the revolution; the struggle continues!\n"

        "file_text": "201.\tI take this opportunity to express my delegation's condolences to the widow and family of the late President of. Egypt, Anwar El Sadat.\n202.\tOn behalf of the People's Revolutionary Government and the people of Grenada, I extend to Mr Klttani our warmest felicitations on his election to. the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that his outstanding qualities, together with the principles which he defends, eminently qualify him to hold that high office and to guide our deliberations hen. The Government and people of Iraq have always been close friends and supporters of our revolution, and our Government and people have reciprocated this friendship and support. We eagerly look forward to returning to your historic and beautiful city of Baghdad for the seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries,\n203.\tMay I also at this juncture express my delegation's deep appreciation of the efficiency with which his predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, carried out his particularly difficult task during the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and the eighth emergency special session.\n204.\tFor us in the Caribbean, it is a source of deep joy to welcome to the United Nations the sister State of Belize. Our Prime Minister who participated in the celebration of that country's independence, witnessed for himself the militant enthusiasm of the people of Belize for their newly won independence. We call on all States Members of: the United Nations to do their utmost to ensure the maintenance of Belize's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n205.\t- Similarly, Grenada extends its greetings to the Re-'public of'.Vanuatu and welcomes it to this family of hatious.\n206.-\t' Grenada is now in its third year of national reconstruction, and some seem to be confused and to be bent on confusing others as to the true character of our revolution. From this rostrum we wish to reiterate that ours is a genuine national effort aimed at the transformation of the unacceptably poor quality and condition of life of our people. The broad objectives of our revolution are: to provide for the material and spiritual development of all our people; to ensure political, economic and social justice for the working people; to forge broad national unity based on patrfttlsm and a deep commitment to nation-building; to ensure economic diversification; to develop scientific methods of planning and organization and urgently to develop our natural and human resources; and to build and strengthen alliances with the international forces struggling for peace and progress for mankind, particularly with those engaged world-wide in genuine- national liberation struggles. '\n. 207. These noble and legitimate aspirations of our people are entirely consistent with the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n208. Regrettably, our efforts to alter our state oi' backwardness and to overcome the legacy of underdevelopment arising out of centuries of colonialism have been grossly misrepresented in some quarters. Indeed, a well-orchestrated and systematic campaign to smear, strangle and overthrow the Grenada revolution was launched, .'209. In the first place, this campaign involved attempts at destabilization through propaganda. Sections of the international media have been engaged in a most vicious campaign of lies, disinformation, distortion and abuse, to vilify and malign the good name of Grenada. For instance, during June 1981, 144 articles were published, systematically attacking Grenada while consciously ignoring Grenada's point of view. Further, the widely-circulated documentary entitled Attack an the Americas, released in January 1981 by the American Security Council Foundation and the Coalition for Peace through Strength, and another named The Prisoner and the Police State, a five-part series broadcast by CBS television In May 1981, project a most waiped and deliberately distorted image of Grenada.\t. \\\"\n210.\tQuite significantly, this well-planned attack on our country and revolution was escalated shortly after a conference of newspaper editors from the English-speaking Caribbean, to which Grenada was not invited, This took place in Washington, D.C., from 22 to 24 June, under the aegis of the United States International Communications Agency and the United States Department of State.\n211.\tThe plan for the destabilization of Grenada has now gone beyond the campaign of lies. We are the victims of economic sabotage, designed by the Reagan Administration to strangle our revolution. In April 1981, the Reagan Administration launched a massive diplomatic offensive, to prevent Grenada obtaining $30 million from a co-financing conference sponsored by the European Community and staged at Brussels on 14 and 15 April. That money was to have been used to help construct our first international airport, with a runway of a mere-9,000 feet, the normal length for our region.. That airport represents the biggest project ever undertaken by our country, and it is Indispensable to Grenada's economic development, particularly for tourism and for the marketing of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n212.\tIn fact, only a few weeks earlier, the-Reagan Administration, through its Alternate Executive Director on the Executive Board of IMF, attempted to block Grenada's legitimate application for an IMF loan of $8.17 million, In Addition, the Reagan Administration used its influence in the World Bank to block Grenanda's effort to secure some $3 million in IDA concessional funds. Then in June 1981, the Reagan Administration offered the Caribbean Development Bank $4 million for basic human needs on the express condition, however, that Grenada be excluded. This vulgar attempt to undermine the Integrity of one of our regional institutions was categorically rejected by that Bank's Board of Governors.\n213.\tIn its continuing attempts to overthrow the Grenada revolution, the United States Administration is preparing to escalate its campaign against Grenada to the level of military intervention. This Impending stage is the most dangerous of all. In August 1981, the United States, as part of military maneuvers code-named \\\"Ocean Venture '81\\\", staged a mock invasion on Vieques Island off Puerto Rico of a country aide-named \\\"Amber and the Amberines\\\". Based on an abundance of evidence, we are convinced that this operation was a rehearsal for the invasion of Grenada and its sister islands of the Grenadines. In addition, the recruitment and training of mercenaries in the United States, particularly in Florida, for use against Grenada continues openly and unashamedly.\n214.\tWe know that the United States has denied having any plans to Invade Grenada. However the fact is that the United States has a well-known and established pattern of initiating aggressive action against other States while at the same time denying such actions and: plans for them.\n215.\tGrenada has been done a grave injustice by the Reagan Administration. Nevertheless, consistent with our policy of good-neighborliness, Prime Minister Maurice Bishop has on two separate occasions written to President Ronald Reagan, expressing Grenada's preparedness to engage in a dialog at a high level In order to.normalize and stabilize our relations. In his lettta:. dated 26 March 1981, the Prime Minister wrote: .- -\n\\\"My Government, has always wanted good relations with your Government and people ... [and] I would like to suggest that our two Governments hold bilateral discussions at the highest possible level to discuss developments and to clear up possible misunderstandings.\\\"\n216.\tThis and a subsequent letter of August 1981 have both gone unacknowledged. We shall continue to make every effort to normalize our relations with the United States, because Grenada follows an established foreign policy which seeks normal and friendly relations with all our neighbors.\n\n217.\tThe-world Is at present in the throes of an economic crisis of grave proportions. Today, for millions of poor people the world over, survival has literally become a daily challenge. In the Industrial Western nations, unprecedented levels of inflation, high interest rates rising unemployment and the mounting fears and Insecurity among people arc shaking the very economic and Institutional foundations.\n218.\tThe present crisis in the Western industrialized countries is placing an even greater burden on the peoples of the developing world who have been struggling to alleviate the ravages of centuries of colonial and Imperialist domination.\t\u25a0\u2022[\n219.\tWe have supported and will continue to support the struggle for a new international economic order. In his address to the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly, Prime Minister Bishop stated:\n' \\\"The present distribution of world economic power wealth and living standards is manifestly unjust. It derives from the long history of imperialist expansion and control of the third world. We seek to change this order and to substitute for it a new international economic - order . . .\\\".\n220.\t' That remains an urgent, realistic and attainable objective, and we must redouble our efforts-to ensure, the early achievement of those goals.\n221.\tGrenada calls also for the early launching of the global negotiations. We believe that the totality of issues that are central to a healthy, just and equitable world order must be discussed in one forum. In that context, Grenada is prepared to offer and endorse proposals that would genuinely advance economic justice for the exploited peoples of the world. The task is urgent. The time for rhetoric has passed. We see the world as one world, a world of interdependence. There must be . a more equitable distribution of the world's, wealth.\n222.\tWe therefore warmly welcome the upcoming Cancun meeting and applaud the leaders of Mexico and Austria for that helpful, creative and bold initiative. Mention must also be made of the tireless efforts of Mr. Brandt, Chairman of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues and a true world statesman in this search for global justice. In this regard, we are very heartened by the more positive reception now being shown be developed countries like Canada and France towards the question of the North-South dialog and the need for a restructured world order. The success of Can-cfin rests upon the just, honest and principled attitude of nations. The world expects a more positive approach from those whose intransigence has blocked progress (m those , issues in the past.\n223.\tOnce again Grenada feels obliged to address the world, and especially the wealthy industrialized world, on the question of the plight of small island developing States. A sizable portion of the membership of this family of nations, in fact some 30 members, belong to this category. They arc sovereign national entities with no frontiers but the sea, with land areas of 1,000 square kilometers or less and a population of 500,000 or less.\n224.\tTwo years ago, the Prime Minister of my country, Maurice Bishop, declared from this rostrum that those is-\nlands constitute another category; of specially in disadvantaged States with disabilities of a peculiar nature. Smallness he said, must be explicitly recognized-as a new dimension in economic relations. He warned that the economic reality of such States demands a new awareness of their problems and requires a genuine attempt to design a, special program of assistance.\n225.\tThe response has been far from encouraging. Each day the disadvantages we suffer become more glaring, whilst very little momentum, if any at all, has been developed towards overcoming our. handicaps. -v. >\n226.\tIn addition to the problems of small size, small population and small internal market, very often some suffer the added disadvantage of remoteness. Remoteness describes a country's peripheral situation vis-a-vis the world economic system, its inaccessibility due to the in-frequency and unreliability of transport and \\\"communication links, or simply its geographical location far away,, relatively, from a more developed center..\n227.\tThe elements of smallness and physical remoteness do not in themselves constitute the real handicaps, however. At any rate, those are constant. What we are concerned about and what can surely be remedied are the economic and social consequences of those physical situations, which consequences frustrate our efforts as Governments and peoples in those small islands, or at best severely restrict the level of positive results our efforts bring.\n228.\tThe economic and social consequences of smallness in the present world economic system include the following: first, limited resources; secondly, an almost total dependence, on external markets due to the very limited internal market; thirdly, lack of an adequate number of trained personnel those who receive an appreciable level of training soon go off to better living standards and more attractive salaries in metropolitan centers; fourthly, lack of institutions and organizations designed for modem production; fifthly, a low level of scientific and technological know-now; sixthly, the high level of imports in the economy; seventhly, propensity to natural disasters hurricanes, earthquakes, freak storms which, because of the small size of the country, devastate the entire country when they strike, not just one region or province; and eighthly, single-product economies.\n229.\tWhat then are our special needs and what are the areas in which the more fortunate can lend their assistance? First, financial assistance to help small island economies to acquire, industrial plants and the relevant technological process to enable them to obtain the Maximum benefits from their most available resource the sea; secondly, relocation of labour intensive industries in small developing - economies with competitive labor costs; thirdly, special emphasis on assisting small island States in developing locally available sources of energy wind, geothermal, solar and so on; fourthly, assistance in processing locally a great proportion of their agricultural produce; fifthly, better terms of trade; sixthly, an increase in the flow of development aid in the form of external assistance; end seventhly, the creation of a special emergency fund for natural disasters.\n230.\tMany listening to me today have the means to assist with all those and more. They must now acquire the\npolitical will to translate their words into deeds. In that regard, we welcome the Energy Co-operation Program for Central American and Caribbean Countries, concluded at San Jose on 3 August 1980 by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela. Of course those plans must necessarily relate to the priorities established by the various Governments, and, in any event, such programs must exclude any military content, contain no political or Ideological discrimination and be applicable to: all countries in the region.\n231.\tAt this point permit me to express my delegation's deep distress at the sudden death of the President of Ecuador, Jaime Roldes, and the former Chief of State of Panama, General Omar Torrijos, and the sad passing of the former President of Venezuela, Romulo Betancourt. All were outstanding in their countries in their time. Permit me to pay a special tribute to Omar Torrijos, the symbol of Panamanian dignity, the leader and catalyst of the Panamanian revolutionary process, a leader in the Central American and Caribbean region, a world statesman. We will always remember the General who marched in the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. The peoples of the world which struggle for justice and freedom will not forget Torrijos's fight to restore Panama's territorial Integrity and for the achievement of. its complete independence and sovereignty.\n232.\tFor centuries the Latin American and Caribbean peoples have been subjected to some of the most barbarous tyranny that has beset the world. The oligarchies have enriched themselves at the expense of tit: people. This is the age of change. The people will no longer tolerate that exploitation. Those who innocently or otherwise suggest that the popular processes of our region are orchestrated from outside are simply poor students of history, for the people who know their history cannot be fooled.\n233.\tGrenada continues to be outraged by the atrocities against the people of El Salvador committed by the Junta. The patriots of that suffering country long ago earned our solidarity, our brotherhood and our everlasting respect. We therefore hail the Mexican-French initiative as an act of statesmanship. We are proud to associate ourselves with the views expressed in the recent joint declaration.' We support without reservation the view that the alliance between the Farabundo Marti Front for National liberation and the Democratic Revolutionary Front constitutes a representative political force, ready to undertake responsibilities and obligations and with a legitimate right to participate in negotiations, on a. political settlement.\n234.\tPeace and justice have as their necessary prerequisite and unconditional acceptance of Ideological pluralism and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. No one has the right to dictate to another, and we deplore the arrogant attitude adopted by some who seek to isolate those with whom they disagree. We especially condemn all efforts to blockade Cuba or to put pressure on Nicaragua by political, economic or military means.\n235.\tAll these points of conflict and confrontation create the conditions for instability. In order to avoid the Caribbean becoming a permanent zone of confrontation and tension, we have consistently called upon tire United Nations and the Organization of American States\ndeclare the Caribbean a zone of peace, This proposal was accepted by the OAS General Assembly at its meeting at La Paz in 1979. At the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of Foreign Ministers of the Caribbean Community, held in Grenada in June 1981, a working committee was set up with the responsibility of elaborating general proposals to give conflict to the declaration. .\n236.\tAnother factor constituting a threat to peace and security in the Caribbean is the activities of mercenaries. This is a matter critical not only to Grenada but also to many countries of Africa, especially since the assassination of the great patriot and hero Patrice Lumumba. The Caribbean region is the latest theater of action for those international murderers in this case, paid, programed and equipped to kill by that notorious racist element the Ku Klux Klan, as well as murderous Cuban and Nicaraguan exile groups operating in the United States. Three Caribbean countries, including Grenada, have been threat; used by those dogs of war,\n237.\tWe therefore express our support for the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and IVaining of Mercenaries, established during the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 35/48]. However, we ore concerned about the slow progress of the work of this Committee and strongly urge that firm and effective measures be adopted in the near future to curb and prohibit the recruitment, training, assembly, transit, financing and use of mercenaries.\n238.\tOnce again the debate on the question of Namibia reverberates through the halls of the United Nations. We had hoped that this thirty-sixth session would be presented with a concrete report on the progress of the implementation of the plan for Namibia's independence. We greatly regret that this is not the case, and we attribute this failure to the racist, apartheid and expansionist regime in Pretoria, which sabotaged and scuttled the Geneva pre-implementation talks held last January. '\n239.\tIt is regrettable that when the overwhelming majority of the Member States of the Organization, in the light of South Africa's intransigence, demanded the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa, three Western countries, permanent members of the Security Council, vetoed the proposed resolution, thus shielding South Africa and condoning its flagrant flouting of the high authority of this highly-reputed Organization.\n240.\tIndignant as we were at this triple veto, today we are even mote indignant and outraged at the efforts being made by certain Western Governments of the contact group of five to modify and alter the plan endorsed in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). As it is, that resolution was a product of compromise. SWAPO, the sole authentic and legitimate representative of the Namibian people, has made several heroic concessions to make that plan acceptable to all. Thus, Grenada adds its voice to the many already raised to demand the early implementation of resolution 435 (1978), unmodified and unqualified.\n241.\tWe understand that the scheme to \\\"strengthen\\\" resolution 435 (1978) involves allowing South Africa to write a constitution for Namibia. It is our unswerving conviction that South Africa possesses neither the moral nor legal right to engage in any such exercise, The articulation of the basic law of the land is the inalienable right of the people of Namibia, led by its sole representative, SWAPO.\n242 Furthermore, those maneuvers to attain more concessions for the racist regime serve only to bolster that discredited clique. Those maneuvers encourage South Africa to flout world public opinion, to persist in its illegal occupation of Namibia and to increase its aggression against the neighboring States, especially Angola, Mozambique and Zambia. This reality was brought home sharply when South Africa, in a show of profound and open contempt for this Organization, staged a massive invasion of the People's Republic of Angola on the eve of the emergency special session on Namibia. The Pretoria regime continues to occupy Angolan territory even now.\n243.\tGrenada expresses its full solidarity with the Government and people of the People's Republic of Angola as they confront the military might of the racist forces of South Africa, which have grossly violated Angola's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We further express our absolute disgust at the United States veto in the Security Council on 31 August 1981 of a draft resolution condemning the South African invasion of Angola and calling for the withdrawal of the racist forces from Angolan territory. That veto by the United States constitutes a veritable shield for South Africa and an endorsement of the illegal action of that outlaw State. It also indicates the growing unholy alliance between Pretoria and Washington.\n244.\tGrenada recognizes that the objective of South Africa's aggressive policy and actions in southern Africa is to perpetuate its racist system of apartheid and racism in South Africa and to overthrow the legitimate Government of Angola. However; Grenada also recognizes that the day Is not far off when the foundations of racism will crumble and the legitimate representatives of the South African people will assume their rightful and historic role.\n245.\tGrenada reiterates its solidarity with the Polisario Front and the Sahraoul Arab Democratic Republic and with the people of Western Sahara as they struggle to attain self-determination. Grenada welcomes and will give every support to the recent Initiatives of the QMJ to formulate a comprehensive peace plan for West-era Sahara. We urge all parties concerned to maintain an attitude of good will and genuine commitment In carder, to effect a final, and just solution to that conflict.\n246.\tRegarding the situation in Cyprus, we welcome the resumption of the inter-communal talks. It Is our earnest hope that the talks will lead to the restoration of unity and the strengthening of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of that country.\n247.\tOnce more, we Issue a call for the peaceful reunification of Korea. We believe that .the proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea provide a reasonable basis for negotiations.\n248.\tWe wish to issue a firm call for self-determination for the people of East Timor.\n249.\tGrenada supports the legitimate aspirations of the Argentinian people to see the Malvinas Islands under their national sovereignty\n250.\tThe situation in the Middle Bast remains tense, and recent events there have actually, aggravated the conditions of instability which prevail. This is manifested in Israel's increased aggression against the Palestinian and Arab people, In its bombing of the Iraqi nuoiear reactoc violating Iraq's sovereignty and displaying utter disregard for international law, and also in its vicious and lethal raids on Beirut and southern Lebanon.....\n25 ll. Also contributing to the heightened tension in the region was the shooting down of two Libyan planes by the United States Navy over the Gulf of Sidra last August. We wish to register our profound indignation and strong condemnation of that premeditated act of aggression against the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Grenada calls upon those forces of aggression and domination to cease their illegal military acts so that the people of the Middle East can enjoy their independence and construct their processes free from outside interference. .\n252.\tWe also take this opportunity to reiterate our firm condemnation of any partial approach to, or agreement on, resolving the untenable situation in the Middle East. We reaffirm our recognition of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and express our irrevocable conviction that the PLO must be a party to any full and comprehensive plan for a just solution to the Middle East conflict. Such a solution must allow for a fully sovereign Palestinian State and for the inalienable right of ,the Palestinian people to their homeland.\n253.\tThe real agent of destabilization, aggression and tension in the Middle East is Israel's Zionism armed by United States Imperialism. Zionism is an indisputable form of racism which, like its twin brother, South Africa's apartheid, has been nurtured on aggression and expansion. Thus Grenada, in unhesitatingly denouncing Zionism as a form of racism, denounces at the same time the parties that equip Israel with the deadly, sophisticated weapons it utilizes to maintain the racist system of Zionism and to perpetrate vicious acts of aggression against the Palestinian people and the sovereign Independent States of the Middle East.\t- -\n254.\tWe call for the ratification of SALT II agreement and for an end to the reckless pursuit of dew arms of mass destruction in the illusory quest for military superiority. How can we continue to justify the expenditure of such huge sums on arms in a world characterized by large oceans of poverty?\n255.\tIn conclusion, let us reflect on the following. While there are dangerous signs in the world so dangerous that one is reminded of the 1930s the truth of the matter is that mankind is not a hostage unto itself. Over the long sweep of history, mankind has displayed a high degree of innovativeness, creativity and resilience. Man does have the capacity to emerge triumphant out of this present crisis.:What is needed is the will, the determination and the courage to face squarely these monumental problems. Above all, we need a renewed spirit of mutual co-operation, tolerance among States and the realization of ,a Wealthier, climate for peaceful .coexistence.\n256.\tLet us all rededicate ourselves to a more just and brighter world for all humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of the United Republic of Cameroon, which I have the honor of leading, is greatly pleased at the election of Mr. Kittani to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. This success is certainly a tribute to his reputation as a man and as a diplomat well-versed in international questions. It is also ah honor to his country, Iraq, a member\\\" of our great family of nonaligned countries and one which enjoys relations of fruitful cooperation with my country. We are convinced that under his guidance our work will be successfully concluded.\n318.\tWe are pleased also to take this opportunity to convey our thanks to his predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, for the authority, competence and courage with which he conducted the work of the thirty-fifth session and of the emergency special session devoted to Namibia.\n319.\tLastly, I should like to pay a special and well-deserved tribute to the SecretaryGeneral. My Government greatly appreciates the tireless efforts which he has constantly made with such self-denial and discretion in the discharge of his difficult functions in the quest for answers to the many problems of our time.\n320.\tWe also welcome the accession of Vanuatu to independence and national sovereignty and its admission as the one hundred fifty-fifth Member of the Organization. Cameroon had the privilege of being involved in the decisive phase leading to the independence of that country, with which it has already laid foundations of fraternal co. operation.\n321.\tWe are also pleased to congratulate Belize on its accession to independence and to extend to it a cordial welcome to the Organization.\n322.\tThe thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time when the world situation gives rise to grave disquiet because of the resurgence of a spirit of confrontation in EastWest relations, distrust, general tension and uncertainty, which have an impact on international peace and security.\n323.\tThis dangerous polarization is detrimental to the essential principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual tolerance and cooperation which are embodied in the Charter and from which flows the policy of nonalignment espoused by my country and the great majority of the members of the international community.\n324.\tThis intensive struggle for spheres of influence and raw materials downgrades and at the same time hinders the legitimate and long thwarted aspirations of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America to better living conditions and full mastery of their destinies.\n325.\tWe need hardly recall here that their human dimension and the weight of their natural wealth and economic potential have become major realities of our age and that it is only right that these peoples should demand an equitable share of the wealth of the world, in the framework of a fundamentally new international order, providing equal access for all, particularly the most disinherited, to wellbeing and happiness.\n326.\tNevertheless, a strong trend in  favor of that necessary change is encountering opposition from certain  favored nations which benefit from the crumbling present economic and monetary system.\n327.\tA schematic analysis of the international economic environment shows that, despite projections indicating a slight improvement for certain countries, the global economic climate is still marred by the same oppositions, growing conservatism and the stepping up of protectionist measures in the industrialized countries. The present crisis has assumed unprecedented proportions, as can be shown from the growing imbalance in the balance of payments, the substantial slowing down of activity and growth, the deterioration of the terms of trade, unemployment and underemployment, inflation, the increased external indebtedness of the developing countries and also the precariousness and insufficiency of food supplies.\n328.\tThe true victims of the crisis are the developing countries, whose fragile economies cannot be expected to recover in the immediate future. In that regard, the SecretaryGeneral rightly observes in his excellent report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"In 1980 there was an actual decline in the per capita incomes of a large majority of the developing countries, and a further year of decline in 1981 cannot yet be ruled out . . .\n\\\"Such a situation of stagnation or increasing poverty is absolutely unacceptable. It contains the seeds of widespread tension and unrest which constitute, in the final analysis, a threat to world peace and stability.\\\" [A/36/1, sect. VI]\n329.\tIn the opinion of my delegation, the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, despite its weaknesses and inadequacies, to which we have already had occasion to refer, could make an effective contribution to supporting the efforts of the developing countries, provided that its objectives are catalyzed by the success of the global negotiations.\n330.\tThe launching of those negotiations, the principle of which was the subject of a consensus in resolution 34/138, continues to be thwarted by the unjustified foot dragging of a minority of industrialized countries which are thus showing their excessive devotion to the outmoded economic system in which we live.\n331.\tThe United Republic of Cameroon, for its part, reaffirms its support for. the proposal by the Group of 77 for a centralized system of negotiations open to participation by all States, aimed at taking major decisions in all spheres: raw materials, trade, energy, food, monetary affairs, finance and development.\n332.\tWe strongly hope that the important initiatives undertaken this year at Caracas and Ottawa will be pursued in a new spirit at the forthcoming meeting in Cancun. We hope that this will make it possible to get the NorthSouth dialog moving again. It would be regrettable if that meeting at such a high level were once again to dash the hopes of a: world in turmoil and uncertainty which feels an imperative need to strengthen solidarity and interdependence among nations as a necessary condition for its survival.\n333.\tThe same spirit should, next spring in New York, inspire all the delegations to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, so as to make it possible for those negotiations, which have lasted for more than eight years, to lead at long last to the concluding of a general agreement. We believe that the draft convention as it now stands represents the best compromise possible, that is, a \\\"package deal\\\" that will equitably preserve the interests of all, rich and poor, and best protect the principle of the sea as the common heritage of mankind.\n334.\tThe present deterioration of the process of detente is having harmful consequences in Africa for the efforts to resolve the problems of Namibia, apartheid and racial discrimination. Now more than ever the essential features of these problems are basically distorted in the sense that the great Powers are relegating to the sidelines the noble ideas of liberty and dignity for which the peoples concerned are struggling, in  favor of the hegemonistic rivalries or what is often now called the \\\"strategic consensus\\\".\n335.\tThis perception of things, which should be denounced, is at the origin of the deadlock and confusion now existing in respect of the question of Namibia. The attempts at absorption made by South Africa are particularly significant. The Pretoria regime is making use of this highly abusive attempt in order to continue to oppose the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia, which it nevertheless did solemnly accept, and to multiply its aggressive acts against neighboring countries.\n336.\tThis attitude on the part of the racist regime is unfortunately being supported by some of those very Powers which worked to elaborate and adopt the aforementioned settlement plan and which under the Charter of the United Nations have special responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n337.\tThe Namibian problem, it must be recalled, is essentially a problem of decolonization which should be examined in relation to General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the peaceful solution of which lies in the immediate implementation of resolution 435 (1978) of the Security Council. In that regard, while we welcome the recent declaration of the five members of the Western contact group reaffirming their determination to continue their efforts to reach a prompt and peaceful solution of the Namibian problem, we hope that these initiatives will not in any sense overshadow the role of the United Nations, the sole legal authority in Namibia, or deny the Namibian people its inalienable right to the free choice of its national institutions.\n338.\tWe reiterate our solidarity with the front-line States and in particular the People's Republic of Angola, whose determination to secure the triumph of the noble cause of liberation of the African continent from the last bastion of colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination has not slackened following the repeated acts of aggression of the racist regime in Pretoria.\n339.\tThe fact that the attention of the international community is currently centered on Namibia should not cause us to forget that in South Africa itself more than 18 million blacks continue to be subjected to one of the most inhuman forms of oppression by a white racist minority which has established apartheid and racial discrimination as a system of government.\n340.\tThe efforts of the international community aimed at the complete eradication of this scourge' are constantly thwarted by new measures of radicalization of the apartheid system, adopted and applied with complete impunity by South Africa with the connivance of powerful foreign interests.\n341.\tFor some time now we have seen certain Powers bound to South Africa by economic and geostrategic interests making an extremely dangerous assessment of the situation in southern Africa which tends to minimize the persistence of apartheid and racial discrimination. We should therefore not be astonished at the numerous attempts to rehabilitate South Africa internationally.\n342.\tIt is necessary to denounce this trend, the purpose of which is to divert the attention of the international community from the cruel reality of the situation.prevailing in the land of apartheid. Such attempts to undermine our efforts can but add to the sacrifices and suffering of the oppressed people of South Africa.\n343.\tOur Organization, which has already condemned apartheid as a crime against humanity, has a duty to reaffirm and increase its support for the struggle being waged by the South African people in the name of human dignity. In this respect everything must be done to ensure that the measures hitherto adopted by the international community to combat apartheid and racial discrimination are effectively applied by all States.\n344.\tDespite the oft expressed desire of the African Governments to devote themselves to economic and social development, as evidenced by the session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity held last year at Lagos on economic matters, we must realize th_: the political situation in our continent remains a matter of concern and constitutes an obstacle to the achievement of this fundamental objective.\n345.\tAs the stake in the EastWest rivalries* which take the form of destabilizing maneuvers and the multiplication and perpetuation of focal points of tension, Africa is thus despite itself drawn into a web of circumstances in which the objectives of development and economic cooperation are increasingly sacrificed to security needs. It is to be feared that if this situation which, moreover, is exacerbated by the world economic crisis were to persist, the independence of our States would be jeopardized.\n346.\tFor our part, we believe that it is of the greatest urgency to reverse this trend by a new approach to the problems of our continent based to a greater extent on the principles of noninterference in the internal affairs of States, respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, relations of good-neighborliness, peace fill coexistence and mutual cooperation. Those principles, which are enshrined, inter alia, in the Charters of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity, guide the United Republic of Cameroon in its relations with other countries and in the search for solutions to the problems confronting Africa.\n347.\tIn this connection we are pleased to welcome once again the dynamic solidarity recently expressed by the international community at the first International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa, held at Geneva. It goes without saying that the results of that meeting will help relieve the suffering of the 5 million men and women who are the victims of conflicts and calamities of all kinds. That conference is an appreciable first step in the mobilization of efforts to solve the disturbing problem of refugees.\n348.\tThe situation in the Middle East remains unstable and potentially explosive because of the persistence of the climate of hatred, tension and armed confrontation which has kept the countries of the area in turmoil for more than three decades. Last June the Security Council emphasized the danger of such a state of affairs by unanimously adopting resolution 487 (1981), condemning the destruction of Iraq's nuclear installation by Israeli forces.\n349.\tIf the conflict raging in that extremely sensitive area is to be prevented from becoming a worldwide catastrophe, it is of the highest importance that we all abide by the principles of the Charter concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes and that all parties agree at last to apply the numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.\n350.\tThis means, first of all, that Israel, which like the other States of the area has the right to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized boundaries, should withdraw from all Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, represented by the PLO, including its right to a homeland in Arab Palestine.\n351.\tThe United Republic of Cameroon is convinced that it is high time for the voice of reason and realism to be heard by all the parties which are confronting each other in this region with increasingly impressive military arsenals. They must realize that violence is essentially predatory and futile and that the path to peace and prosperity is necessarily through negotiation and cooperation.\n352.\tIt is also to negotiation that the Governments of Iraq and Iran should have recourse to put an end to the armed conflict in which they have been involved for over a year, causing their peoples untold suffering and sacrifice. We earnestly hope that the leaders of the two countries will take account of the urgent appeal of the international community and respond  favorably to the mediation efforts of the United Nations, the nonaligned countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to return to peace. This also means that the great Powers must show restraint and refrain from any interference in this conflict. Indeed, we know full well how regional disputes can get bogged down in increasing complexities as soon as the antagonistic ambitions of the great Powers and their hegemonistic rivalries are introduced.\n353.\tSouthEast Asia and SouthWest Asia are cases in point. In Kampuchea the situation remains deadlocked in the face of the tangled nature of the problems, whether they concern the violation of the principles of the Charter or the tragic human dimension. No peaceful solution of this question can be envisaged without the participation of the superPowers, whose ambitions and rivalries are disturbing the peace and stability of that part of the world. That is why we deplore the missed opportunity of the International Conference on Kampuchea held recently in New York, which unfortunately took the form of a monologue owing to the absence of some of the main parties concerned. Nevertheless, we hope that the mechanism of permanent consultation instituted on that occasion will make it possible to renew the dialog among all the parties concerned so as to give the people of Kampuchea a real opportunity to choose its own national institutions in freedom and sovereignty.\n354.\tSuch an opportunity should also be extended to the Afghan people, in keeping with the wishes frequently expressed by the international community. We are following with interest the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral and his Special Representative to identify the elements of a peaceful solution of this question, which is of the greatest concern to the international community because it so gravely jeopardizes detente and, indeed, concerns the very essence of the Charter.\n355.\tMy country's well-known dedication to the principles of good-neighborliness, the non-use of force in international relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes dictates its attitude in respect of this problem.\n356.\tOur loyalty to these principles leads us to reiterate our appeal to the ^divided peoples of Cyprus and Korea with a view to the resumption and pursuit of a constructive dialog free from any foreign interference.\n357.\tIt is impossible to overemphasize the extent to which the proliferation and persistence of these regional conflicts, which further the ambitions of the superPowers, hinder economic and social cooperation, while fueling the arms race.\n358.\tThe deterioration of detente by virtue of heightened EastWest rivalry in the last two years has halted, if not reversed, the efforts made previously to promote the process of general and complete disarmament under effective international control through the implementation of specific measures such as the reduction of military budgets, particularly those of the great Powers, and the allocation of the resources thus released to assistance to developing countries. In respect of strategic arms limitations, the indefinite postponement of the ratification of the SALT II treaty and of the consultations on the launching of negotiations on SALT III are very much a part of the hardening attitude shown by the general increase in defense budgets, the growth of which this year has reached a level rarely equaled in peace time.\n359.\tFurthermore, because of the uncertainty, tensions, instability and conflicts that characterize the situation in the third world, the need for security is leading those States also to allocate large sums to military expenditure.\n360.\tMy country hopes that the second special session of the Assembly devoted to disarmament, to be held in 1982, will revive the hopes that were raised by the 1978 special session and will help to create among Member States a hew willingness to begin to give effect to the recommendations of the General Assembly.\n361.\tIn this connection, we would like to see a strengthening of the role of the United Nations, whose, primary mission is to contribute to the safeguarding of international peace and security. This means that the Organization must be granted ever increasing means, that its organs, structure and functioning must be constantly improved and revitalized, and that it must be able to rely on the firm, declared political will of its Members, especially those on which the Charter places special responsibilities in international relations.\n362.\tIt is urgently necessary, then, to give effect to our frequently expressed wish for a democratization of international relations to promote the creation of conditions that will ensure equal participation by all States in the functioning and decision-making process of United Nations organs.\t'\n363.\tBecause of its universal vocation the United Nations which is, above all, a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends provides the sole forum for conciliation and dialog in which States great and small, rich and poor, can, with mutual respect for their differences, work together for the common good of man.\n364.\tThat is why the United Republic of Cameroon, which firmly believes in the ideals of peace, justice and freedom, which are the primary conditions of all economic and social development and of the wellbeing of all peoples, reaffirms its faith in the Organization and its determination to make the most effective contribution it can to the attainment of these noble objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  The delegation of Liberia extends heartiest congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly. We note that you bring to your onerous responsibility not only sterling leadership qualities but also more than two decades of experience in the United Nations system.\n2.\tOur sincere thanks and appreciation go to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, for the services he so ably rendered the Organization. Much was expected of him, and much was received.\n3.\tWe also wish to thank the SecretaryGeneral for his continuing efforts in guiding the activities of the United Nations in the pursuit of international peace and security.\n4.\tPermit us to add to the words of welcome that have been extended to Vanuatu and Belize upon their advent to membership in the Organization. We wish their people well as they embark upon the task of nation building. We look forward to the day when all peoples and countries under alien domination can exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, freedom and independence.\n5.\tWhen we appeared before the Assembly at the thirty- fifth session [13th meeting], we did so at the advent of a revolutionary process. We were privileged to give an overview of this process and to explain its causes and effects. As we appear before you once again, we wish to underscore some of our achievements thus far.\n6.\tIt is pleasing to note that the revolution has not departed from its original objectives. Consistent with the commitment of the People's Redemption Council to return power to civilians in the shortest time practicable, a Constitutional Commission, clothed with special privileges and immunities, has been mandated to draft a constitution by which Liberia can return to civilian control and democratic institutions.\n7.\tConcomitantly, the Government of Liberia, under the leadership of Commander in Chief Samuel Kanyon Doe, is acting with all deliberate speed to effect progressive changes in the quality of life of our people and relieve the problems which made the revolution not only necessary but inevitable. Our people are motivated by a firm determination to resolve the problems which beset Liberia: 90 per cent illiteracy; cultural alienation; an economy which produces what we do not consume, while we consume what it does not produce; an inadequate health delivery system; 53 per cent unemployment within the active labor force; and a pattern of corruption which was bequeathed to the people by the erstwhile princes of privilege.\n8.\tIt may be recalled that the People's Redemption Council inherited a bankrupt treasury with an overdraft of $11 million, along with external indebtedness amounting to more than $700 million. However, with perseverance and tenacity, we have rescheduled our loans abroad, formulated a development plan and, with the assistance of IMF, worked out a stabilization program to set the basis for economic recovery.\n9.\tCommander in Chief Samuel Kanyon Doe and the People's Redemption Council have also engaged in the summary release from detention of former officials of Government who were charged with high treason and rampant corruption. By this act of magnanimity our people have been spared the trauma of protracted trials which could have invoked disturbing memories of the past and thereby detracted from the process of national reconciliation. The prisons have been rendered virtually empty.\n10.\tWe have gathered here, as we have done for 35 years, to engage in our annual review of developments in the world today.\\\" After these many years of our collective wisdom, there is still polarization of the many nations of the world. Mighty nations seem adrift, and the spectre of a nightmare now looms larger than the prospects for peace. Lurking in the hearts and minds of many of us in this Hall are designs and schemes of war against our neighbors. The world is today consumed by mounting problems: an arms race, food shortages, an energy problem and a range of economic ills inflation, unemployment, protectionism, low levels of capital formation and unstable commodity markets.\n\n11.\tIn our domestic settings, many Governments have created oppressive circumstances which inhibit men from living and acting as men circumstances \\\"which blind men to their goals, prevent them from taking measures to free themselves and militate against the vision and boldness of the human spirit.\u2003\n12. Implicit in the search for peace over the past 35 years have been two basic convictions: first, that the cooperation of the great Powers would condition the environment in which peace could be preserved and security guaranteed; and, secondly, that Member States, as a matter of commitment, and therefore honor, would strictly adhere to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n15; These conditions have never been met, and many high hopes in the Charter have proved to be most disappointing. Instead of cooperation, we see rivalry and disagreement among the great Powers; instead of strict adherence by all Member States to the Charter, nonconformity is common; and instead of progressive steps towards global cooperation and unity, we find Member States preoccupied with parochial concerns to the exclusion of the collective interest. We see the United Nations, which ought to be the conscience of mankind, being reduced to an arena for peaceful war or a warlike peace  pax bellicosa, bellum pacificum. Each year we all cry \\\"Peace, peace\\\", but there is no peace.\n14.\tIf we are to succeed in attaining our common goals and aspirations, we must develop a sense of community. We must forge cooperative partnerships and work together meaningfully to discuss and solve our common problems. These are the high principles to which the Government of Liberia is committed and it is within the broad context of these principles that we now turn to specific issues on our agenda.\n15.\tWe welcome the designation of 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons. We believe that the dedication of a year to the disabled will contribute to public understanding of disability and emphasize the need for rehabilitation. To this end, appropriate measures are being designed in Liberia.\n16.\tLiberia's position on decolonization is clear and unequivocal: we reaffirm our solidarity with all colonial countries and peoples, especially the struggling people of southern Africa, who, with the blood of martyrs, are resisting systematic laws of exploitation, discrimination and suppression.\n17.\tLiberia continues to feel that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has all the attributes for ensuring the independence of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. We remain convinced that as long as South Africa can find solace in some quarters of the contact group it will continue to reject the plan for Namibia's independence referred to in that resolution, will increase its repression of the Namibian people and will engage in acts of destabilization and terrorism against Mozambique, Angola and other neighboring States. It was therefore with much relief that we welcomed the brief but unconditional affirmation of the United States commitment to resolution 435 (1978).\n18.\tThe situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea demonstrates the insecurity of small States of the international community. It also points to the impotence of the Organization in the face of serious threats to the security of small nations. We totally reject and are absolutely opposed to the presence of foreign troops in the two countries and we call for their immediate withdrawal to enable the people to choose their own form of government without outside interference of any kind.\n19.\tDevelopments in Cyprus continue to constitute a threat to international peace and security. We urge due respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that State, and we call for a resumption of the inter-communal talks so that the miseries of that long-suffering people will come to an end.\n20.\tThe international economic outlook continues to be characterized by uncertainty, especially for the developing countries. Many of these countries are faced with mounting unemployment, spiraling inflation, worsening terms of trade, rising protectionism, dwindling sources of financial assistance and overall economic stagnation. Indeed, many of the developing countries are threatened with imminent economic collapse.\n21.\tMembers of the international community, particularly developed countries and oil-producing States, must all strive to rise above the temptation to pursue shortsighted objectives of self-interest at the expense of the wellbeing of the global economy.\n22.\tOur Government welcomes the determined efforts of the United Nations system to rallying Member States to undertake serious discussions and seek solutions to the problems confronting the international economy. We refer specifically to the recent United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi, and the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris this month. In the same vein, we look forward with much anticipation to the forthcoming NorthSouth summit, scheduled to be held in Cancun.\n23.\tLiberia has consistently maintained, and continues to maintain, a Middle East policy based on the following principles: first, that a just and lasting peace cannot prevail in the Middle East without due recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to a State of their own; secondly, that Israel must withdraw completely from all occupied Arab lands; and, thirdly, that all States in the region, including Israel, have a right to live freely within secure and internationally recognized boundaries with the fullest respect for their territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n24.\tWe wish to register our support for Egypt in its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crises in the Middle East. Our sympathy certainly goes to that State which, far from shouting the loudest, pays the highest price, in both men and material, for war in that area of the world. We find nothing intrinsically wrong with partial agreements, and we are convinced that the Camp David agreements represent a meaningful initial approach. We believe Egypt needs the encouragement of men of good will everywhere with a view to achieving a broader and more comprehensive solution.\n25.\tFor our part, we will not permit it to be said of President Sadat as was said in 1874 of Walpole, that \\\"in vain [he] battled . . . against the cry for war ... He stood alone in his desire for peace.\\\" It may be recalled that Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, took the initiative of issuing a call last year for all States which have severed diplomatic relations with Israel to begin a reexamination of their policy. It may also be recalled that the birth of Israel was the culmination of a United Nations proceeding. Interestingly, too, Liberia cast the deciding vote in 1948 which gave rise to the existence of Israel.\n26.\tWe persist in stimulating public debate on the issue of diplomatic fence-mending because we believe that the increasing estrangement and isolation of Israel undermine the prospects for a peaceful solution to the Middle East problem. Links must exist to facilitate communication. In order to reconcile warring factions, the parties must at least be reached.\n27.\tWhile our own reexamination process has been slow, it has produced some modest results by at least compelling us to concretize our views.\n28.\tWe find that the ostensible reason for the severance of ties with Israel solidarity with Egypt on the matter of the violation of its territorial integrity no longer obtains. Cairo has effected a modus vivendi with Tel Aviv, and Liberians ought not to be more Egyptian than Sadat. Yet there are issues which continue to concern us, and some of them have claimed the attention of the Israeli authorities.\n29.\tWe find disturbing the collaboration between Tel Aviv and Pretoria. It is equally disturbing to be reminded of the open secret that some black African States maintain vibrant and extensive economic links with South Africa. At the same time, it is reassuring to note that an active Jewish community exists in South Africa with strong anti-apartheid sentiments.\n30.\tFurther, considering the close ties of friendship and cooperation which exist between the Lebanese and Liberian peoples, the Government of Liberia was distressed by Israel's recent bombing of Lebanon. We believe such an act undermines the prospects for peace in the area and trust that all parties concerned will henceforth exercise restraint.\n31.\tAnother matter which remains of crucial concern to us is the just cause of the Palestinian people. In the spirit of AfroArab solidarity, we remain irrevocably aligned with them in their struggle. We are therefore awaiting with keen interest the results of the talks on Palestinian autonomy which began in Cairo a few days ago.\n32.\tIn accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, particularly the principles of self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, Liberia believes that the Korean question should be solved through peaceful negotiations between the peoples of North Korea and South Korea. To that end, we call on the SecretaryGeneral to renew his offer made in 1979 to both Seoul and Pyongyang to perform an intermediary role. Furthermore, membership in the United Nations of both North Korea and South Korea should be encouraged to help alleviate tension and create a  favorFable climate for stability. This should be urged without prejudice to the eventual reunification of the Korean peninsula.\n33.\tMany years of hard work and resourcefulness have gone into the formulation of a convention on the law of the sea on the basis of the principle of the common heritage of mankind. Despite significant advances, a final text has yet to be agreed upon. We continue to await a common regulation, universally acceptable, to govern the sea and thereby ensure that its benefits and resources are shared by us all.\n34.\tDespite the many obstacles confronting the United Nations, we believe it has the capacity to bring about a more peaceful, just and equitable world community. However, it requires the highest degree of our understanding, cooperation, dedication and commitment. Let us therefore resolve that each of us will bring to the Organization now and in the years to come the fullest measure of those qualities. In the cause of the people, the struggle continues.\n"

He represents a country with which Nepal has very friendly and cordial relations. My delegation is confident that with his experience, skill and wisdom, he will guide the work of this session to a successful conclusion.\n152.\tI also wish to express our appreciation to Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany for the impartiality and efficiency with which he conducted the business of the last session of the General Assembly.\n153.\tI wish also to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a compliment to the SecretaryGeneral for his dedication to the ideals of the United Nations and for the exemplary manner in which he has discharged the heavy responsibilities of his high office during the past ten years.\n154.\tNepal welcomes Vanuatu and Belize as Members of the United Nations. Their admission is a further step towards the goal of universality of the membership of the world Organization.\n155.\tThe past year has offered little relief from the situation of uncertainty. The efforts of the international community to end the armed interventions, in various parts of the world have yet to bear results. The process of detente continues to be seriously threatened, and the arms race has been escalating with renewed vigor. Sharp divisions continue to mark the relations between the big Powers. A just international economic order is not in sight. Present trends in international affairs are in contradiction of the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. In a world where interdependence and complementary relations among nations are deepening, it is only logical that matters which affect everyone must be decided by all. By the same token, it is equally logical that matters which affect the life of only one country must be left to that country alone to decide.\n156.\tNepal firmly believes that the only foundation for secure and just international relations lies in universal acceptance of the principles of the Charter and of the consequent obligations without qualification. We appeal for international cooperation based upon that spirit. While we reiterate our commitment to the United Nations and express our hopes for its future, we also expect the United Nations to be an effective instrument in creating a better international climate, one of peace and prosperity, free from interference, interventions or wars.\n157.\tNo other problem has a larger dimension and deeper implications than the grim economic situation facing the world today. The question of a minimum decent standard of living for all humanity continues to be one of the crucial questions facing the international community. The developing countries, in particular the least developed among them, have been suffering substantial setbacks in terms of slower growth and widening payment deficits as a result of the world economic crisis.\n158.\tThe recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held at Paris provided a unique opportunity for an in-depth study of the severe problems facing these countries. While the record of concessional assistance to this group of countries has been disappointing, their vulnerability to external factors continues to grow with the stagnation and even decline in their production and exports and the increase in the price and volume of their imports. Against this background, it was not enough for the Paris Conference to adopt certain performance targets. What was required was a serious commitment to take practical measures to break the cycle of poverty and deprivation.\n159.\tIn that connection, I wish to quote what my sovereign observed while addressing the Conference in Paris on behalf of the member countries of ESCAP and ECWA:\n\\\"Indeed, the presence of the poor and hungry among us is a challenge to all value systems, to our religions, to all our moral principles or political theories. It is also a challenge to the United Nations system and all its organs and agencies, not to speak of the Charter of which we are all signatories. It is also an affront to humanity, to man's better judgment, his cherished ideals and institutions. But above all the presence of destitutes on such a colossal scale is an insult to modern man, his science and conscience, his ingenuity and technology, his dreams and his deeds. And it is here I feel there is need for the international community to come forward to help us to help ourselves and commit us all to support the proposed Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s. For this program carries with it the dreams and hopes of the least developed countries and shows them the prospect of an oasis dimly, appearing on the horizon of an endless desert.\\\"\n160.\tThough the final outcome of the Paris Conference did not meet all our expectations, we nevertheless view it as significant and encouraging. One important achievement of the Conference was the widespread consensus on the need for a substantial increase in the assistance provided to the least developed countries by 1985. We welcome the agreement on the need for simplification of conditions of assistance. We also welcome the Substantial New program of Action adopted at Paris as an important link in the vitally needed interaction between the developed and the developing countries.\n161.\tIt has been widely accepted that the deteriorating world economic situation has left no major group of countries or geographical areas untouched, and yet the impasse in the global negotiations still persists. A realistic way of making a fresh start on the global negotiations would be to take up specific areas of the existing economic order and to examine critically the premises on which they were built in the past.\n162.\tNegotiations should concentrate on building the premises anew wherever the utility of the old assumptions has been eroded by time and by changes in international affairs. Though the forthcoming Cancun meeting is not a negotiating conference, we hope that free and frank exchanges of views there can serve as a catalyst for the global negotiations.\n163.\tMy Government views the question of economic cooperation among developing countries as being within the larger framework of global economic restructuring. The High-level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries held at Caracas this year has established a framework for the developing countries' pursuit of mutual cooperation and collective self-reliance. Nepal looks forward to the translation of the program of Action adopted at that Conference [see A/361333 and Corr.l] into reality as an essential part of the new international economic order.\n164.\tThe sharp rise in the price of energy in recent years has underlined the need to look for alternative sources. Efficient import substitution through development of domestic production of energy has become one of the critical challenges for a country like ours. Nepal possesses abundant resources for hydroelectric generation from the scores of mighty rivers flowing from the Himalayas. Nepal is determined not only to harness and utilize those vast water resources in a planned way but is also willing to share the benefits with other countries of the region. However, like other developing countries, Nepal faces a number of constraints arising from a lack of infrastructure, capital, skilled manpower and technological knowhow. While diligent efforts and drives on a national level to overcome those constraints are inevitable, the task can hardly be fulfilled without adequate financial and technological support by the international community.\n165.\tThe recently concluded United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy at Nairobi has set forth a Program of Action which includes a series of policies and measures designed to expand and ensure a sustained supply of energy from both conventional and non-conventional sources. We call for the implementation of the Nairobi Program of Action. We also welcome the recommendation of the Conference to set up an intergovernmental body to mobilize resources in order to implement the program of Action.7\n166.\tThough they are not adequate, we appreciate the initiatives and efforts undertaken by multilateral financial agencies to promote the development of energy resources in developing countries.\n167.\tThere can be no enduring security in the world as long as global poverty and economic injustice prevail. I* is from those two aspects of security and development that my Government has watched with growing concern the recent upsurge in the arms race. While close to 850 million people in the developing countries are living a marginal existence, enduring extreme poverty and destitution, could anything be more irrational than the unbelievable amount of resources now being expended on armaments? The people of the world are justifiably impatient over the failure of the big Powers to negotiate a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty and thereby strengthen the nonproliferation regime. That failure has had disastrous consequences in both horizontal and vertical proliferation of the nuclear menace. It is equally saddening that efforts to conclude a treaty to ban chemical weapons remain frozen.\n168.\tThe growing tendency to accept the doctrine of limited nuclear war, together with the freezing of the strategic arms limitation talks, bode even more difficult times ahead. If the achievements in and outlooks for nuclear disarmament have been bleak, prospects for disarmament in conventional weapons have been equally disappointing. The impasse in arms control negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union has paralyzed all disarmament progress. That stalemate has been projected into multilateral disarmament forums, with the result that both the Committee on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission have been at a virtual standstill. We appeal to both the United States and the Soviet Union urgently to initiate serious negotiations on those vital issues, which concern the very existence of mankind.\n169.\tThe present situation has created a sombre background for the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament scheduled to convene next year. That special session provides an opportunity to break the present impasse, but the risk of its failure is obviously high. Nepal believes that the principles of and the basis for an effective approach to disarmament, have already been laid down in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session [resolution S10/2], the first devoted to disarmament. The major task before the second special session is to maintain and reinforce the momentum generated by the first one and to carry towards their logical conclusions the goals of its Final Document. The coming special session should undertake an in-depth appraisal of the current situation regarding disarmament problems and the causes that have led to stagnation of or inadequate results from the disarmament negotiations held so far.\n170.\tNepal hopes for a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations on the law of the sea that will accord universal recognition to the principle that all the resources of the seas belong to humanity as a whole and constitute a common heritage of mankind. That is the principal idea behind the proposal for the establishment of a common heritage fund. We earnestly hope that recognition of the right of landlocked countries to free access to and from the sea will form an essential part of the new regime of the sea. A successful conclusion of the ongoing negotiations will, I am sure, greatly strengthen the role of the United Nations in finding solutions to issues of global importance.\n171.\tIn a general statement of our policy concerning the major issues facing the international community, I cannot overlook certain political problems. I wish to begin by referring to the far-reaching consequences of the events in Kampuchea and in Afghanistan. We have repeatedly stated our view that armed intervention in both those countries was a clear violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Nepal holds the principles of noninterference in internal affairs and respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries to be articles of faith. We cannot accept any justification for armed intervention, nor do we recognize the situation created by such intervention. In both Kampuchea and Afghanistan, total and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces constitutes the essential first step towards the normalization of the situation. Such a total withdrawal will lay the foundation for the people of those countries to exercise their right to self-determination.\n172.\tThe recently held International Conference on Kampuchea has formulated a general framework for a negotiated political settlement of the Kampuchean question. We hope that all parties concerned will soon join the negotiations for a peaceful settlement that will ensure peace and stability in the whole SouthEast Asian region. Nepal has always believed in the peaceful resolution of disputes among States. The Charter of the United Nations provides ways and means for achieving such solutions. We once again call upon the United Nations to press for political settlements in both Kampuchea and Afghanistan.\n173.\tThe Middle East situation has deteriorated considerably in the past several months. The continued armed attacks by Israel aimed at undermining the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon have caused us grave anxiety. We deeply regret the recent indiscriminate Israeli bombing of Beirut and other parts of Lebanon. As a troop contributor to UNIFIL, Nepal appeals to Israel and all other concerned parties to cooperate with UNIFIL in restoring full Lebanese authority in that troubled country. I wish to express our deep sympathy to the Governments and peoples of Fiji, Ireland and Nigeria for the losses their contingents have suffered this year in the service of peace. My delegation joins the SecretaryGeneral in his appeal to those Governments which have been withholding payment of their assessed contributions to UNIFIL to reconsider their position. There should be no question that the financing of a duly authorized United Nations peacekeeping force is the collective responsibility of all Members of the United Nations.\n174.\tWe have often repeated our position that every State in the Middle East, including Israel, has the right to live in peace and security within well-defined boundaries. However, we are convinced that a just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem cannot be achieved unless the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to be an equal partner in peace negotiations and their right to a separate State of their own, are recognized. The total withdrawal of Israel from all territories occupied since 1967 constitutes the first prerequisite of a negotiated settlement. Indiscriminate, and unjustifiable military actions like the recent Israeli bombing of Iraqi nuclear installations can only aggravate an already very difficult situation.\n175.\tNepal repeats its sincere appeal to the two neighboring nonaligned countries\u2014Iran and Iraq to exercise maximum restraint and to seek a peaceful solution of their problems.\n176.\tOn the question of Cyprus, Nepal continues to give full support to the inter-communal negotiations under the auspices of the SecretaryGeneral. We reiterate our position that any political settlement of the Cyprus question must be based on strict respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and nonaligned character of Cyprus.\n177.\tWith regard to the Korean question, my Government continues to hold the view that the aspirations of the Korean people to national reunification should be fulfilled peacefully through direct negotiation without outside interference.\n178.\tMy delegation deeply regrets the duplicity of South Africa in thwarting the United Nations plan for a free Namibia. We reiterate our support for the just struggle of the people of Namibia for national liberation under the leadership of SWAPO. My delegation likewise remains steadfast in support for the just struggle of the people of South Africa against the abhorrent system of apartheid. We fully endorse the Paris Declaration on Sanctions against South Africa adopted by the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa and once again appeal to the Security Council to act in conformity with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the international community.\n179.\tI cannot fail to express our great appreciation for the valuable assistance and support extended by the various bodies and specialized agencies of the United.Nations to our development efforts. It is indeed heartening to note that in spite of problems and the sometimes besetting frustrations, the United Nations has been making serious efforts to tackle the multidimensional issues of economic, social and humanitarian problems.\n180.\tWe note with deep appreciation the magnificent achievements of the program of humanitarian assistance to the people of Kampuchea. Equally reassuring are the efforts to launch a massive program of assistance for African refugees. The records of these achievements reinforce our belief that there can be no alternative to the United Nations in realizing the goals of promoting economic and social advancement of all peoples. Guided by those considerations, my Government is prepared to cooperate actively in the efforts to revitalize the Economic and Social Council.\n181.\tAs a nonaligned country, Nepal has full faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Our abiding faith in the United Nations is reflected in the incorporation of the purposes and principles of the Charter in the directive principles of our Constitution. In an effort to develop a coordinated approach to bilateral* regional and global issues, we have always pursued a policy of seeking and respecting the views of others. Inspired by the ideals of mutual benefit and collective self-reliance, we have always expressed our readiness to join our neighbors in any prudent exploitation of the vast human and natural resources in the collective interest of the whole South Asian region.\n182.\tOur proposition that Nepal be declared a zone of peace is the ultimate expression of our traditional national ideals, our quest for peace and security and our aspiration to development. This proposition embodies our belief that good-neighborliness and friendly relations among the countries in the region should be reflected in the full understanding of the views, problems and aspirations of others. The zone-of-peace proposition is the expression of our commitment to strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with all our neighbors and friends; it is consistent with the principles of the United Nations and the ideals of nonalignment.\n183.\tI have spoken at length on the issues confronting the international community and our perception of those issues. We believe that the constructive forces of change should lead towards positive development. The Charter of the United Nations represents a constant in the eternal flux of things. The principles embodied in it represent the only valid framework for the endeavor of man for the well-being of man. I appeal for a re-dedication to these principles.\n184.\n"

        "file_text": " I should like first of all, Sir, to congratulate you most warmly on your brilliant election to the presidency of this Assembly. I am firmly convinced that your diplomatic experience will en ablp you to discharge honorably the heavy responsibility that has been entrusted to you. I should like through you, Sir, to extend my warm congratulations to the Vice-Presidents and the other members of the General Committee.\n71.\tTo our eminent Secrestary-General, I should like to reaffirm my Government's high appreciation of his devotion and his tireless efforts in the cause of international peace and cooperation.\n72.\tWe should also like warmly to congratulate Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu on their admission to the United Nations as the one hundred fifty-fifth and one hundred fifty-sixth Members and to extend a cordial welcome to their worthy representatives.\n73.\tThe thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly has opened at a time when the international situation promises to be difficult and complicated. Indeed, while the forces of peace, national independence, democracy, justice and socialism are growing stronger everywhere in the world, the imperialists and those in certain Western military circles are adopting a belligerent policy and striving to recover the positions they have lost by reviving the cold war and signaling the start of an arms race. All this constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security, and these reckless actions have adversely affected international relations.\n74.\tThus, over the past 12 months detente has gradually given way to a policy of confrontation, the arms race has been carried on at an accelerated rate and the world economic crisis has worsened.\n75.\tNegotiations on arms limitation and disarmament in various bodies of the United Nations and elsewhere have yielded scanty results in the course of 1981. The bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of strategic arms were unilaterally broken off by the American side, to the great detriment of the cause of disarmament. Furthermore, the United States has not only refused thus far to ratify but has even called into question the SALT II treaty. The recent decision of the United States Government to manufacture the neutron bomb constitutes a further escalation of the arms race.\n76.\tIn order to avert this peril threatening all mankind and contemporary civilization, the peoples of the whole world must join forces against this new escalation and vigorously condemn the dangerous doctrine of \\\"limited nuclear war\\\" advocated in certain imperialist circles and frenetically supported by international reactionaries.\n77.\tThis acceleration of the arms race, motivated by the new United States Administration's policy of confrontation with the socialist countries, in particular the Soviet\nUnion, with national liberation movements and with progressive and peace-loving countries throughout the world has not only made it more difficult to arrive at any solution to the major world problems that have been facing us for years, but has also exacerbated a number of regional conflicts.\n78.\tIn Latin America and the Caribbean the United States, in spite of international condemnation, continues to provide every kind of assistance to the dictatorial Governments that are its lackeys, such as those of El Salvador, Chile and others, for the purpose of suppressing' the most elementary democratic rights and freedoms and savagely slaughtering their peoples, whose struggle, now in a decisive stage, will lead to certain victory.\n79.\tAgainst Cuba, Nicaragua, Grenada and other Latin American countries which have opted for a policy of free and independent development free from all imperialist domination, the United States has pursued a policy of interference, pressure and threats of aggression.\n80.\tIn Europe, we have seen with great concern a revival of tension resulting from attempts by the United States and certain circles in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to install new medium-range nuclear missiles in order to revive the cold war. At the same time, they are supporting counterrevolutionary forces in Poland in order to sow disorder there and to deflect that country from the path of socialism.\n81.\tOn the African continent, particularly in its southern part, the continued occupation of Namibia by South Africa, and the Pretoria Government's policy of apartheid, which are supported by imperialism, have led to a considerable increase in tension, thus posing a serious threat to peace and security, not only in Africa, but in the world at large.\n82.\tThe recent eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, devoted to the question of Namibia, clearly demonstrates the great concern of the peoples of the world over the deteriorating situation in Namibia after the obstinate refusal of South Africa to withdraw from that Territory and the intensification of its acts of aggression against Angola, Mozambique and other neighboring countries.\n83.\tIn the Middle East, 1981 has seen the proliferation of acts of aggression by Israel, with the unreserved support of the United States, against Arab countries, particularly Lebanon, with a view to eliminating Palestinian resistance and threatening the security of Syria. The unprovoked attacks by Israel against Iraq's nuclear reactor and by the United States against Libyan aircraft are all irrefutable evidence of their belligerent actions and their flouting of the principles of international law and morality.\n84.\tIn the region of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, the bloody conflict between Iraq and Iran, two neighboring nonaligned countries, has caused considerable suffering and losses to both parties and has given the United States further excuses to exercise its military supremacy in that very sensitive part of the world by strengthening its air and naval base at Diego Garcia, by establishing new bases, known as \\\"military facilities\\\", and by creating \\\"rapid deployment forces\\\" which are ready to intervene at any time to defend the so-called vital interests of the United States.\n85.\tIn view of this imminent danger, the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace in accordance with the profound aspirations of the coastal peoples is urgent. It is regrettable that the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean, proposed for this year, did not take place because of the unconstructive attitude of the major Western Powers. In the interests of peace and stability in the area, my delegation believes it would be desirable for that Conference, which was unwisely postponed, to be held in 1982.\n86.\tIn Afghanistan, the imperialists and international reactionaries are continuing their undeclared war against the Afghan revolution, thus creating extreme tension in that part of the world.\n87.\tIn SouthEast Asia, the hegemonistic and expansionist policies of the Peking leadership have brought about a constant state of tension and threaten the security and independence of Laos, Viet Nam and Kampuchea as well as the peace and stability of the whole region. Indeed, in order to achieve their dark designs, the Peking hegemonists, in close collusion with the American imperialists, have tried, first of all, to pit the countries of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [AS\u00a3/W] 'against the three countries of IndoChina, which would facilitate their maneuvers of interference, undermining and aggression there. They are also attempting to sow division among the countries of IndoChina, which constitute a serious obstacle to their advance towards the south.\n88.\tThe recent visit of the Chinese Prime Minister to certain ASEAN countries was for the sole purpose of camouflaging Peking's support for pseudo-revolutionary groups in those countries and inciting them to adopt a more intransigent attitude towards the three Indochinese countries. This has further worsened the tension between the two groups of countries. The result, not reckoned on by Peking, is that the two-faced policy of the Peking hegemonists has been exposed, and certain ASEAN countries are now fully aware of it.\n89.\tWith regard to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the Peking hegemonists, encouraged and supported by the United States, have greatly reinforced their troops and intensified their armed provocations along the ChineseVietnamese frontier, with a view to threatening Viet Nam in all areas. This bears a strong resemblance to past American intervention against Viet Nam and against Laos and Kampuchea. The recent so-called International Conference on Kampuchea, in which China, the United States, the ASEAN countries and their allies together played a role, is also striking evidence of this.\n90.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic, together with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and all the socialist countries and other justice-loving countries, rejected and condemned that Conference as a crude attack on the independence and sovereignty of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, and we wish to state once again that we consider all the decisions emerging from that Conference to he null and void.\n91.\tAt their meetings at Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh in January and June respectively of this year, the Foreign Ministers of the three Indochinese countries reaffirmed their proposals for the holding of a regional conference to settle all problems of common interest [see At36/86, annex I, and A/36/328, annex /].\n92.\tBut it is regrettable that those coherent and realistic proposals, which are moreover totally in accordance with the spirit and letter of the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, were not accepted by the ASEAN countries. And what is more, certain ASEAN countries, at the instigation of Peking and Washington, have even made it possible for meetings to be held at Singapore and later at Bangkok among reactionary Khmers in exile, with a view to forming a \\\"united front\\\" and a so-called coalition government. Such acts constitute flagrant interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea. Ultimately, those meetings have served only to make public the inevitable dissension among those factions. So whatever subterfuges may be used by Peking and Washington against the Kampuchean people, they cannot possibly alter the politically and legally stable situation in Kampuchea.\n93.\tIn his recent statement at New Delhi, the Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of Kampuchea noted that \\\"the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, in agreement with the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, will consider the partial withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea if Thailand ceases its support of and aid to the remnants of the Pol Pot supporters and other little groups of reactionaries in their attempts to undermine the People's Republic of Kampuchea, and if it ceases to provide sanctuary on its territory for those elements.\\\" This is a new and very positive step towards a concrete solution of the problem of Kampuchea and towards the establishment of peace, stability and mutual understanding among the countries of the region.\n94.\tThe three countries of IndoChina will nevertheless continue their efforts to bring about consultations with the ASEAN countries, in accordance with their proposals, with a view to settling differences between the two groups of countries.\n95.\tIn this context, my delegation, after consultation and agreement with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea, has the honor of presenting here a certain number of principles to govern relations between the two groups of countries of IndoChina and ASEAN.\n96.\tFirst, there must be respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of each, and nonaggression, equality, mutual advantage and peaceful coexistence between the two groups of countries of IndoChina and ASEAN for the sake of peace, stability, friendship and cooperation in SouthEast Asia.\n97.\tThere must be respect for the rights of the people of each country to choose and develop freely their political, social, economic, and cultural system and to determine freely their internal and external political courses in accordance with the principles and objectives of nonalignment and of the Charter of the United Nations, and no imposing of the will of one party on another.\n98.\tThe internal and external affairs of each country belonging to the groups of countries of IndoChina and ASEAN must be determined by their own people, without any country having the right to intervene individually or collectively, directly or indirectly.\n99.\tSecondly, outstanding controversies and differences between the two groups of countries of IndoChina and ASEAN, and also between other countries of the region, must be settled by peaceful means, through negotiation, and in the spirit Shat all problems of SouthEast Asia should be settled by the countries of the region in accordance with the principles of equality, friendship, mutual respect and understanding, bearing in mind the legitimate interests of all parties, by common accord, without the imposition of the will i>f one party on another, without external interference and without recourse to the threat or use of force in their relations.\n100.\tThe must be respect for the right of all countries of IndoChina and ASEAN, and also the other countries of SouthEast Asia, to take individual or collective self defense measures in accordance with the principles of nonalignment and the Charter of the United Nations, and no country shall be allowed to use collective defense treaties to serve its own particular interests and to oppose other countries of the region.\n101.\tThirdly, there must be continuation and development of bilateral and multilateral cooperation in economic, technical, scientific, cultural, sport and tourist matters between the two groups of countries of IndoChina and ASEAN, and also with other countries of SouthEast Asia, on the basis of the principles of equality and mutual advantage, with a view to strengthening understanding and mutual confidence and relations of friendship and good neighborliness in the interests of building up each country in accordance with its special circumstances.\n102.\tThe countries concerned in the region will cooperate to exploit the Mekong with a view to developing their respective economies and also the common prosperity of the region.\n103.\tFourthly, there must be respect for the sovereignty of countries with coastlines on the South China Sea over their territorial waters and their sovereign rights over their exclusive economic zones and their continental shelf.\n104.\tThe landlocked country of the region must be given  favorable conditions for transit to and from the sea, and that country must be given maritime rights and advantages in accordance with international law and practice.\n105.\tThere must be settlement of disputes between the countries with coastlines on the; South China Sea over maritime zones and islands by means of negotiation. Pending the solution, the interested parties must undertake to do nothing to aggravate existing differences. The countries of the area will join forces to seek together means of cooperation among themselves and also with other countries, whether or not they belong to the region, in exploiting the resources of the sea and ocean floor on the basis of mutual respect, equality, mutual advantage, the preservation of the marine environment against pollution, the guaranteeing of international communications and of freedom of shipping and overflight in the area.\n106.\tFifthly, countries outside the area must respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of the region and put an end to all forms of pressure and threats from outside and creating a situation of tension and hostility among the countries of the area.\n107.\tThe countries of the area will allow no country to use their territory as a base for aggression or direct or indirect interference in the affairs of other countries.\n108.\tThese countries declare their readiness to cooperate with other countries outside the region and with international organizations and to accept their assistance when no political conditions are attached.\n109.\tBilateral or multilateral cooperation among the two groups of countries of IndoChina and ASEAN, and also other countries of the region with those outside the region, must in no case prejudice the security and interests of other countries of the area, nor should it be directed against any other country.\n110.\tSixthly, in order to make fruitful the application of the above mentioned principles, a permanent body would be set up which would be entrusted with the task of organizing dialog and consultation among two groups of countries of IndoChina and ASEAN, possibly with the participation of Burma. The composition of this body, to be determined by common agreement, would comprise one or more countries representing each group on the one-to-one principle. This organ would meet annually in order to resolve the various problems raised concerning relations among the members of the two groups and could hold a special session in the case of any urgent or crisis situation.\n111.\tSeventhly, the above mentioned principles would constitute the basis of the dialog and consultations to be held, which would be directed towards concluding an agreement or some other form of understanding between the two groups of countries of IndoChina and ASEAN, which would be ready to invite other countries of the area to participate therein.\n112.\tWith regard to the situation in my country, since the foundation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic on 2 December 1975, a multinational Lao people has devoted all its efforts and energies to healing the wounds of war while building a new life. In spite of the numerous problems bequeathed by the long and devastating war, together with the disastrous consequences of floods and drought, and in spite of the subversive and undermining activities of our enemies, we have, thanks to our own efforts and the assistance of fraternal and friendly countries, as well as the assistance of international organizations, produced significant results in many fields. In particular, we have firmly safeguarded our country and laid down certain bases for the economic, social and cultural development of our people.\n113* This year we began to put into effect our first five year development plan. It is our conviction that, thanks to the determination and sustained efforts of our people and to assistance, from friendly and fraternal countries and from international organizations, we will be able to fulfill this plan, However, the Peking hegemomsts, in collusion with the imperialists and other reactionaries, are pursuing their sinister activities aimed at destabilizing our country by massing their troops along the LaotianChinese frontier, where they have been engaged feverishly in training exercises and preparations for battle, firing shells and infiltrating our territory.\n114.\tFurthermore, while stepping up their campaign of propaganda and calumny against our country, they have been encouraging, training and arming reactionary Lao exiles and sending them back into Laos, directly or through a neighboring country, to fight against the Lao people. They have been seeking by every possible means to pit us against our neighbors.\n115.\tIn the face of such a policy of provocation, intimidation and intervention, Laos and the two other countries of IndoChina, which in the past as in the present have always fought shoulder to shoulder against common enemies, will continue to strengthen their cooperation and special ties of solidarity in defense of their independence and the building up of their respective countries in this new era.\n116.\tThese ties of special solidarity among the three countries of IndoChina pose a threat to no one. At their conference in Phnom Penh on 13 and 14 June last the Foreign Ministers of Laos, Viet Nam and Kampuchea stated that the cessation by China of its attacks and armed acts of provocation against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Lao People's Democratic Republic and its support for the Pol Pot clique and the reactionary Khmer forces would facilitate the settlement of their dispute with China on the basis of the principles of strict respect for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, nonaggression, noninterference in internal affairs, equality and mutual advantage.\n117.\tWith the Kingdom of Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic has always scrupulously applied the provisions of the joint LaoThai communique of 1979 making the frontier between the two countries a frontier of peace, friendship and cooperation with a view to promoting relations of good-neighborliness between the two peoples. However, that communique has still to be given full effect on a permanent basis by the other party, without foreign interference. For this to happen, the Thai authorities must demonstrate a greater measure of realism and common sense if they want to see an improvement in relations between the two countries.\n118.\tAs you will have realized, the international situation is a matter of constant concern because of the policy of confrontation chosen by the United States, the keystone of which is the \\\"antiSoviet strategy\\\". However, the socialist countries; the nonaligned countries and other peace-loving countries have consistently made constructive proposals to strengthen detente, to consolidate peace, to curb the arms race and to bring about confidence building measures in Europe as well as in the other continents.\n119.\tFaithful to its policy of peace, independence, friendship and nonalignment, the Lao People's Democratic Republic commends the constructive .attitude of the socialist countries in all negotiating forums on disarmament and supports the proposals put forth by the twenty sixth Congress of the Communist Party: of the Soviet Union on measures to promote the cause of disarmament. In this regard, the Lao People's Democratic Republic welcomes the initiative taken by the Soviet delegation in requesting the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an item entitled, \\\"Conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space\\\" [item 128], an initiative aimed at excluding the arms race from the realm of outer space.\n120.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic is in  favor of the resumption of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of strategic arms and energetically condemns the decision of the United States Administration to manufacture the neutron bomb, a decision which serves only to increase the risk of a nuclear conflagration.\n121.\tSimilarly, we  favor a further intensification by the United Nations of its efforts to avert at all costs the danger of a nuclear war which, in view of the present high level of accumulation and sophistication of nuclear weapons and, above all, the growing tendency towards the proliferation of such weapons, constitutes more than ever before a real threat of universal extinction. In this context, we consider most timely the initiative of the Soviet Government in submitting for consideration at this session of the Assembly a draft declaration on the prevention of nuclear catastrophe [see A!36/241]. The adoption of a declaration on this subject would undeniably contribute to the restoration of a climate of confidence in international relations and would exert a beneficial influence on the negotiations on the limitation and ultimate elimination of strategic and nuclear weapons.\n122.\tWe condemn the interference of certain Western countries in the internal affairs of Poland, and we hope that the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish State will be able to overcome all the difficulties Poland is now facing. We appreciate the measures taken by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to help the Polish people safeguard the achievements of the revolution.\n123.\tInter-communal negotiations to arrive at an equitable and lasting solution to the problem of Cyprus seem to have been making time for the last few months. In the interest of the whole Cypriot people, foreign interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus must cease so that those negotiations can progress.\n124.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic energetically condemns the policy of interference, pressure and threats of aggression by imperialism against Cuba, Nicaragua, Grenada and other Latin American countries and supports the struggle of the peoples of El Salvador and Chile to recover their democratic rights and freedoms. At the same time, we support the just struggle of the Puerto Rican people for its right to self-determination and independence and vigorously condemn the use by the United States of biological weapons against Cuba. Those weapons have caused casualties among the civilian population and done considerable damage to agriculture and stock breeding.\n125.\tWe energetically condemn all equivocation and obstructionism designed to prevent the implementation of the decisions of the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly. We should like to reaffirm our unshakable support for and solidarity with the Namibian people in their victorious struggle, under the leadership of SWAPO, for their national independence.\n126. We also wish to reaffirm our militant solidarity with the front-line States, particularly the People's Republic of Angola, against the acts of aggression and intimidation by the racist regime of South Africa.\n127/ We continue our support for and militant solidarity with the valiant Sahraoui people, courageously waging its just struggle for self-determination and independence under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front.2\n128.\tWe vigorously condemn the acts of aggression by Israel against Lebanon and against the Palestinian civilian population, as well as its attack on the nuclear reactor of Iraq. We support the just struggle of the Palestinian people, under the leadership of the PLO, to recover its inalienable national rights, including the right to establish an independent Palestinian State in Palestine.\n129.\tWe vigorously condemn the subversive designs and machinations of the international imperialists and reactionaries in Afghanistan and we reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Afghan people who, with the disinterested aid of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, is waging a valiant struggle to defend its independence and sovereignty as well as the achievements of the revolution of April 1978. In this spirit, we support the proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to begin bilateral negotiations with Pakistan and Iran or, if those two countries so wish, trilateral negotiations, in both cases with the possible participation of the Secrestary-General or his representative.\n130.\tWe support the struggle of the Korean people for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the southern part of Korea and for the independent and peaceful unification, of Korea, without foreign interference.\n131.\tIn the context of peace and stability in Asia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic firmly supports the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic [see A/36/388] with regard to an international convention on nonaggression and the non-use of force in relations among the countries of Asia and the Pacific region.\n132.\tAfter having suffered so long the crimes and terror of genocide, the valiant people of Kampuchea are still forced to endure the flagrant injustice of having their representatives debarred from the Organization, while the seat reserved for its representatives continues to be occupied by the very people who were their executioners.\n133.\tEver since its foundation the People's Republic of Kampuchea has shown itself to be a State that is responsible and capable of meeting its international and national obligations. Over the past few years the Kampuchean people have brought about a remarkable revival. After the general elections which took place throughout the country last May, the Kampuchean people established legislative, executive and judicial authorities and other State institutions according to the course that it had chosen. Those are the very conditions required of a State Member of the United Nations. The Lao People's Democratic Republic therefore feels that it is high time the international community redressed this injustice by restoring without delay to the People's Republic of Kampuchea the seat that properly belongs to it in the United Nations and driving out the representatives of the criminal gang of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary, whom the Kampuchean people has already judged and condemned in absentia. No argument, even the pseudo-juridical argument of foreign intervention invoked by several Members of the Organization on a selective basis, can possibly justify this continued denial of the inalienable right of the People's Republic of Kampuchea to contribute to the work of the Organization.\n134.\tThe Laotian people reaffirms its unswerving solidarity with the Vietnamese people in its brave struggle on all fronts to defend its homeland against the threats of aggression by the hegemonists in Peking. The Lao People's Democratic Republic fully supports the proposals of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam with regard to measures to bring about an end to hostilities, the separation of the troops of the two countries and the creation of a demilitarized zone in order to restore peace and stability to the SinoVietnamese border, as well as its proposals to resume as soon as possible the third series of Sino-Vietnamese talks at the deputy foreign minister level to discuss matters of common concern, with a view to restoring normal relations between the two countries.\n135.\tTo sum up, we give our unreserved support to the struggle of all peoples against aggression, imperialist occupation, colonialism in its old and new forms, hegemon ism, racism and racial discrimination, apartheid and Zionism, because all these factors constitute the primary threat to international peace and security.\n136.\tTogether with the augmentation of political tension, 1981 has also been marked by the aggravation of the world economic situation. Indeed, the economic crisis which has held the world in its grip for several years has continued to worsen, because of the lack of appropriate measures which should have been taken by the developed capitalist countries to redress the situation. In this regard, the proposal of the developing countries that global negotiations on development and international cooperation be embarked upon with a view to bringing about the new international economic order has encountered unjustifiable obstacles erected by certain developed countries which took part in the NorthSouth dialog in Paris. In the interest of mutually beneficial international cooperation it is necessary for the negotiations to begin as soon as possible and to lead to the desired results. Otherwise, it is to be feared that the economic difficulties will become worse, giving rise to international crisis with the gravest possible consequences.\n137.\tI have just set out the views of my Government on the major problems of concern to international opinion over the past 12 months.\n138.\tBefore concluding I should like to repeat the commitment and readiness of the Lao People's Democratic Republic to contribute by every means in its power to strengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations. However, it is hardly necessary to stress that the Organization's authority and effectiveness depend essentially on its decisions and its ability to settle all the issues submitted for its consideration.\n139.\tFor the United Nations to remain a true instrument of international peace and cooperation, it is absolutely necessary for all its Members constantly to bear in mind its noble mission and to refrain from transforming it into an instrument for interference in affairs that fall within the sovereignty of Member States. Realistic, just and enforceable decisions are the only ones that will promote the strengthening of the prestige of the United Nations. My delegation will spare no effort to make its own contribution to that end.\n140.\tI hope that the work of the General Assembly during its thirty-sixth session will have great success.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic most warmly congratulates you on your election to the Important post of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and wishes you every success in your important task.\n37.\tWe note with satisfaction that the family of the international community of nations has been joined by two new Members, the Republic of Vanuatu and Belize. That represents one more step in the task of ensuring the complete universality of the Organization.\n38.\tThe most chronic important, problem facing mankind and the United Nations today is the preservation of peace on our planet, to ensure the right of people to life and peaceful activity and to protect them from military catastrophe that is the crucial task which, in the current circumstances of exacerbation of the international situation, must be solved jointly by all peoples,\n39.\tWe realize that it is by no means easy to solve that problem. Imperialist and hegemonistic forces are deliberately whipping up political tension and arc continuing an unbridled arms race, ensuring supremacy for themselves, destabilizing the world situation and suppressing by force the desire of peoples for national and social liberation. They are attempting to dictate their will to other States and to lord it over their natural resources and use their\n40.\tAll that, more than ever before, is leading to an intensification of the danger of war and an increase of the threat of nuclear conflict. The Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community are combating adventurism in international affairs as well as the desire of belligerent imperialist circles to put at risk the vital interests of mankind for the sake of achieving narrow and selfish aims with a policy of peace and closer co-operation and mutual understanding among, peoples and States,\n41.\tConsistent adherence to the peace-loving course was emphatically reaffirmed at the XXVIth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, where a whole set of initiatives was put forward to limit and reduce nuclear and conventional armaments, eliminate sources of conflict and bring about the peaceful settlement of controversial International problems.\n42.\tThe multi-faceted and large-scale nature of those new proposals has amply demonstrated the responsible approach of the USSR to the solution of fundamental problems of our times. The highest legislative organ of the Soviet State, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, has solemnly declared in its recent appeal to parliaments and peoples of the world that the Soviet Union threatens no one, nor does it seek confrontation with any State in the West or in the East. The safeguarding of peace, the statement stresses, has been, is and will continue to be the highest goal of Soviet foreign policy.\n43.\tThe forces of aggression and reaction are exerting tireless efforts and are doing everything they can to bury the Idea of detente, undermine the principles of peaceful coexistence and halt and reverse the process of socio-political renewal in the world. However, today it would not be out of place to recall that even in the most complicated periods, the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries displayed optimism and adopted a realistic approach to the solution of pressing international problems. The subsequent development of the international situation confirmed the correctness of that approach. In his statement at Kiev on 9 May last, on the occasion of the 36th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet people over Hitlerite fascism, Leonid Ilylch Brezhnev stressed:\n\\\"The experience of the post-war years has shown that war can be prevented. All kinds of dangers have emerged in the last three and a half decades. There has been the cold war. There have been dangerous, even critical, moments, But the imperialists have not succeeded in pushing mankind into the abyss.\\\"\n44.\tNow, when the danger of a thermonuclear conflagration capable of destroying civilization on earth is particularly grave, it is the highest duty of the United Nations and of all States and peoples to defuse tensions and remove the threat of nuclear war hanging over the peoples.\n45.\tThe United Nations, whose principal objective under the Charter is to save present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war, should strongly and urgently come out in favor of preventing the nuclear threat. An important and specific step in this direction, in accordance with the vital interests of all countries and peoples, would be the adoption of a solemn declaration on the prevention of a nuclear catastrophe, the draft of which has been submitted by the Soviet Union for the consideration of the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session.\n46.\tWe believe that the General Assembly should solemnly call on the leaders of nuclear Powers to act in such a way as to eliminate the risk of the outbreak of a nuclear conflict and by their joint efforts, through negotiations conducted in good faith , and on the basis of equality, to stop and reverse the nuclear arms race, and to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful and constructive purposes.\n47.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is deeply convinced that the adoption by the General Assembly, in the name of all States Members of the United Nations, of a declaration authoritatively and resolutely proclaiming the first use of nuclear weapons to be the gravest crime against humanity, and condemning as contrary to human moral standards and the noble ideals of the United Nations any doctrine allowing for the fast use of such weapons, would exert a restraining influence on the dangerous development of world events and would contribute to the elimination of a nuclear threat and to progress in limiting and reducing nuclear armaments.\n48.\tThis Soviet Initiative is especially timely now that the NATO countries and above all the United States are pushing the world towards a new spiral In the arms race. Leading circles In Washington have proclaimed as their top priority Objective for the next years the attainment of military Superiority over the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community, to this end, astronomical sums are being appropriated for military purposes and qualitatively new types and systems of weapons with huge destructive potential are being developed. Today at 2.00 p.m., the President of the United States announced the decision to re-equip and modernize the strategic nuclear forces of the United States, to deploy the MX rocket system and to build by 1986 100 strategic 'B.-1 bombers. This is a truly ominous decision, taken in the interests of the military-industrial complex of the United States. It is planned to deploy on the European continent some 600 additional United States medium-range nuclear missiles. Plans are being overtly developed for a so-called limited nuclear war, and other militaristic doctrines are being proclaimed. A little earlier, with a cynical distend for the will and interests of the peoples, it was declared that neutron weapons me being added to the already huge United States nuclear arsenal.\n49.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR would like to stress in this connection that the work of the United Nations should serve the purpose of mobilizing peace-loving forces , to preclude another dangerous spiral of the aims race.\n50.\tThe neutron weapon is a particularly fiendish and cruel means of mass annihilation. This weapon lowers the threshold of nuclear war and consequently increases the danger of its outbreak. Its production and deployment by one group of States would inevitably lead to appropriate counter-measures being adopted by another group of countries and would open up a new path for the nuclear arms race.\n51.\tThe attempts of those who try to prove to us that the neutron weapon is defensive in nature are futile. It is an offensive weapon and reference to its combat capabilities to justify the \\\"acceptability\\\" of limited nuclear war is nothing but an attempt to accustom people to the idea of the admissibility of a \\\"limited\\\" nuclear war. The implementation of plans for the neutron weapon may have irreversible consequences for mankind, including medical and biological ones. If we take into account the fact that the neutron weapon is designed for deployment primarily in Western Europe it is not difficult to realize that it would be the people of the European continent, whose destinies are being totally disregarded in United States military and strategic plans, who would be the first to suffer.\n52.\tIn accelerating the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race, its sponsors and instigators are undermining many of the treaties and agreements concluded earlier on arms control and disarmament. What happened to the SALT O treaty on the limitation of Strategic Arms is, of course, common knowledge.- The United States is responsible for torpedoing negotiations on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons tests, the prohibition of chemical weapons, the limitation of sales and transfer of conventional arms, on questions concerning the Indian Ocean and other matters.\n53.\tTo justify this aggressive policy, war hysteria is being fanned and that old hackneyed trick of the enemies of socialism a slanderous campaign, about the \\\"Soviet military threat- is resorted to. This campaign becomes particularly vicious each time another Pentagon budget comes up for approval.\n54.\tIt has been repeatedly stated from this rostrum that the USSR and the countries of the socialist community are countering the course pursued by the imperialist circles of the United Suites and other Western countries a course which aggravates the international situation with their readiness to conduct negotiations on all pressing international problems and to approach with understanding all constructive proposals put forward by other countries aimed at achieving specific results in curbing the arms race, and bringing about a transition to genuine disarmament. The USSR and the other socialist countries strongly favor on Immediate constructive dialog, and the reduction of levels of military confrontation both In specific areas of the world and in the world as a whole. There is not a single type of weapon which they would not be ready, to limit or ban on a mutual basis, by agreement with other States.\n55.\tOn more than one occasion the Soviet Union has proposed solutions to various problems concerning the limitation of the arms race, primarily the nuclear arms race, and disarmament. What is required for their implementation is that appropriate negotiations should start as soon as possible. Another year has passed, and specific negotiations proposed by the countries of the socialist community on the cessation of production of all types of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction and eventual elimination of stockpiles of these weapons have not become a reality. The reason for this is well known. It is to be found In the obstructionist course pursued by the United States and China, who are boycotting these extremely important negotiations.\n56.\tThe Administration in Washington cannot be allowed to bury thee process of strategic arms control, which today exerts a great political influence on the whole complex of Inter-State relations. We arc convinced that the United Nations should strive further for the resumption and intensification of talks, which ate currently being blocked by the United States and its allies, on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear weapons tests and on the non-stationing of nuclear weapon on the territories of those States .where there ate no such weapons at present.\n57.\tFurther momentum should be given to the talks on., banning other weapons of mass destruction, Including chemical weapons. Plans by United States militarists to start the production and deployment of new generations of chemical weapons pose a serious threat to progress In these talks, in particular in the Committee on Disarmament. In whipping up the chemical weapons race they are\n\\\"once again resorting to the threadbare tack of slanderous fabrications against the socialist countries. We express the hope that in this Important issue, too, a sober attitude will prevail and that instead of a new spiral in she chemical weapons race we shall sec a resumption of the Soviet-American talks on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and the destruction of such stockpiles. Such talks could contribute to the preparation of an appropriate international convention.\n58.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR opposes extending the arms of any kind in outer space and supports the draft treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space submitted by the Soviet Union [A/S6H92]. It is aimed at creating conditions that would rule out the possibility of the use of outer space us a kind of bridgehead for war preparations that arc quite definitely aimed at the Earth.\n59.\tWe feel that a new impetus to fruitful negotiations on these and other pressing problems of limiting the arms race and disarmament can and should be provided by the\nsecond special session of the General Assembly devoted, to disarmament, which Is scheduled to be convened in a little more than six months. To this end, it is important that its preparation and work should from the very start be oriented towards the adoption of specific measures to curtail the arms race.\n60.\tThere is general recognition of the idea that the achievement of genuine results in arms control and disarmament and in the overall strengthening of the peace and security of peoples would be considerably facilitated by an atmosphere of confidence In relations between States, The Ukrainian SSR believes the strengthening of security on the European continent to be of extreme Importance. Confidence-building measures in the military field adopted through the joint efforts of the participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have generally proved to be quite useful. In the interests of strengthening European security, the XXVIth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union proposed that agreement be reached both on a further expansion of confidence-building measures in the military field and on the zone of application of such measures, and in particular that they should be extended to cover the entire European part of the Soviet Union, provided that Western States take a corresponding step to accommodate the Soviet Union. As yet, however, no such step has been taken.\n61.\tOf particular importance in the present-day world are efforts to settle international conflicts, and to preempt and eliminate tension. There is a legitimate fear that the present situation in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, southern Africa and a number of other areas of the world, for which imperialist forces are to blame, may at any moment get out of control and detonate not only a regional but even a global explosion.\n62.\tThe Middle East continues to be one such explosive area. The anti-Arab Camp David deal has reversed the process of the Middle East settlement and untied the hands of the Israeli aggressors. Barbaric bombing attacks on peaceful civilians in Lebanon and the no less barbaric raid by the Israeli air force on the nuclear research center in Iraq, which is under IAEA supervision, are just some of the recent criminal acts that Tel Aviv has committed with the blessing of Washington, all of which constitute an escalation of its policy of international terrorism.\n63.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR wholeheartedly shares the view that the cause of a settlement in the Middle East can be moved out of the present position of deadlock only through a collective search fur a comprehensive settlement on a Just and realistic basis within the framework of a specially convened international conference with the participation of all the States concerned, including the PLO, the legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.\n64.\tRecently the situation in southern Africa has deteriorated sharply. The South African racist regime continue', to frustrate the decolonization of Namibia and to disregard Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which contains a specific plan for the solution of the Namibian problem.\n65.\tThe Ukrainian SSR favors ensuring the the independence of Namibia as soon as possible, while preserving the unity and territorial integrity of the country and transferring power to SWAPO, which is recognized by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] as thee sole legitimate representative of the people of Namibia.\n66.\tWe believe that the aim of the policy of delaying on various pretexts the solution of the Namibian question is to undermine the basis of the political settlement provided for in United Nations decisions, to legalize the puppet groupings in Namibia and to prevent SWAPO from participating in determining the future of the country.\n67.\tThe complicity of the United States and other Western Powers in the political, economic and military strengthening of the South African racist regime is tantamount to encouraging that criminal regime to continue its illegal occupation of Namibia, prevent a settlement and commit new acts of aggression from Namibian territory against neighboring African States, It is quite obvious that the Pretoria rulers would not have risked mounting another adventure in Angola had they not been sure of support for their aggressive actions from international imperialists and reactionary forces. It is very illuminating that it was not long before such support was provided by the United States by means of a veto in the Security Council of the draft resolution condemning the racist aggression and demanding the immediate withdrawal of South African troops from Angola. We support the appeal by African States for the adoption by the Security Council of International sanctions, against South Africa.\n68.\tThe Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean areas are be? coming ever more dangerous hotbeds of International tension, In stepping up its military presence the United States is expanding its existing military bases in that area and striving to create new ones. The Ukrainian SSR is in favor of declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace and of convening, of an international conference to this end at the earliest possible opportunity.\n69.\tA political settlement is necessary for the situation created around the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, It is the fault of the United States and China that an undeclared war is being waged against this sovereign State and attempts are being made to interfere in its internal affairs. The path towards a political settlement is outlined in the specific and constructive proposals contained in the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of. Afghanistan of 24 August 1981. We are confident that a settlement could be achieved if those proposals were to meet with an appropriate response from other States in that area, particularly Pakistan.\n70.\tImperialist and hegemonistic circles continue to interfere in the affairs of the countries of IndoChina, particularly the People's Republic of Kampuchea, and to inflate the artificially created Kampuchean question. A realistic program for establishing stability  the area has been put for wan I by the Governments of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. It advocates that negotiations on a regional basis be held on the subject, in a spirit of good-neighborliness and peaceful coexistence, and without outside interference. We believe that tills end would be served by convening a conference with the participation of the countries of IndoChina and those of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]\n71.\tIn the interests of peace in Asia it is necessary also that the situation in the Korean peninsula be normalized, The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that the Korean question must be resolved by peaceful means. We have consistently favored the withdrawal of American troops from the territory of South Korea and the unification of Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis, and we support the relevant proposals of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea.\n72.\tThe proposal by the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic regarding the preparation of a convention on mutual non-aggression and the non-use of force in relations among the States of Asia and the Pacific, and the convening of a conference of States of that region [see A/36/388] would be Important steps in the strengthening of peace in Asia. On this question we are guided by the conviction that the formalization in a treaty of the principles of the renunciation of force in relations between the States of the region would serve as a guarantee of the consolidation of.the bases of security in Asia.\n73.\tNowadays in the West, in the United States in particular, much is being said about the struggle against international terrorism, but there is a deliberate distortion of the real state of affairs. Efforts are being made to equate. terrorism -which is rightly condemned by world public opinion -with the legitimate struggle of the peoples of the world for their national and social liberation, We are categorically opposed to crude demagoguery about the struggle against international terrorism being used to conceal the activities of those who are breeding the ideology of racial and national hatred, who turn a blind eye to the resurrection of nazism and fascism, who support reactionary dictatorial regimes, who openly patronize the policy and practice of apartheid, who flagrantly violate human rights In the occupied Arab territories and who protect criminals from the bloodthirsty Pol Pot clique.\n74.\tWe are profoundly convinced that the legitimate liberation struggle of the Palestinian people, as well as of the peoples of Namibia and other colonial and dependent territories, will be, crowned with success.\n75. The United Nations must contribute in every possible way to the earliest complete Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)] and strive for the implementation of all its provisions by all States. In this connection, we cannot but draw attention to the attempts to dismember and annex the strategic Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, that is, ' Micronesia, which are being made by the United States in violation of the Charter of the United Nations, in disregard of the Security Council and contrary to tho Declaration. Such unilateral actions cannot be regarded as legitimate or valid. The destiny of the people of Micronesia forms part of the problem of decolonization, and it is the duty of the United Notions not to permit legalization in any, form of the de facto annexation of that Territory by the United States.\n76.\tThe main reason for the continued existence of the vestiges of colonialism Is the policy of the major Western Power? designed to preserve and strengthen their political, \\\"military and economic positions in the world. This was made, very clear at the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa held at Paris last May. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR wishes to declare once again its full support for the national liberation movements waging a struggle for the independence of their peoples.\n77.\tTwo decades have gone by since the foundations were laid for the non-aligned movement. At that time independent States of Asia, Africa and Latin America were not very numerous in the international arena. Today the non-aligned movement represents a major factor in international relations. It reflects the natural desire of liberated countries collectively to oppose the forces of Imperialism, colonialism, racism and hegenonism, to defend freedom and to strengthen their independence, for which their peoples have paid a high price.\n78.\tWe are in favor of all-round fruitful co-operation with the developing and non-aligned countries. The policy of detente has promoted such co-operation, enhanced the economic and political role of newly independent States and made the non-aligned movement more active on an anti-imperialist basis. The trend towards the declaration of certain regions of the globe as zones of peace and the elimination of United States military bases on foreign territories has gained strength. Newly free countries are demanding more and more vigorously that capitalist States and their monopolies pay the bill for inequitable trade and economic exchange and they are more and more insistently demanding that Inequality in economic relations be eliminated.\n79.\tIt should be noted, at the same time, that the achievement of genuinely complete national independence is impossible without the removal of the neo-colonialist fetters which restrain the development of many developing countries and bind them to the system of world capitalist economy. As is well known, the United Nations In the 1970s adopted a whole 'series of progressive instruments, in particular the Declaration and program of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-Vl) and 3202 (S-Vl)) and the Charter of Economic Right and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)J, the main purpose of which was to eliminate inequality in trade and economic relations between-developed capitalist countries and developing countries and to do away with the neo-colonialist exploitation of the labor and natural resources of young States by Western monopolies.\n80.\tThe past years, however, have demonstrated that the practical Implementation of those instruments and the very idea of a new international economic order have en countered the stubborn opposition of leading Western countries. They pursue a policy aimed at preserving the subordinate situation of developing countries within the system of capitalist division of labor and at holding back their independent economic development.\n81.\tThe discriminatory trade policy and the use of economic ties as a means of exerting political pressure by Western countries are causing great damage not only to economic interests but also to the cause of peace and detente.\n82.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is of the opinion that international trade and economic co-operation on the basis of equality, mutual advantage and respect for independence and national sovereignty is one of the safeguards of peace and security. However, it should not be forgotten that a genuine and effective solution of economic, social and other problems facing mankind is possible only In conditions of peace and with the elimination of the threat of war and the curbing of the arms race.\n83.\tThe Ukrainian people is involved in peaceful creative activity for the implementation of the plan of social and economic development for 1981-1985 adopted at the XXVIth Congress of the Ukrainian Communist Party. The plans for economic, social and cultural development in our country are viewed as being inseparably linked to the implementation of the most Important international task, preserving and strengthening peace; for peace is the common heritage of mankind and the foremost condition for its existence and it should be ensured by the joint.efforts of the peoples.\n84.\tIn conclusion, I should like to quote the words of Mr. V. V, Shcherbitsky, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine; \\\"Mankind has suffered enough and deserves the victory of peace over war, trust over suspicion, reason over insanity. We believe that peace on earth will be preserved.\n"

        "file_text": " For reasons of brevity, given the lengthy agenda of the present session of the General Assembly, the delegation of Paraguay will refer only to a few items that call for its immediate attention.\n2.\tMr. President, we wish you success in the important functions entrusted to you, and we hope that at the end of your term we will be congratulating you, as we now congratulate Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar for the skill with which he conducted the thirty-fifth session. We also wish to thank the Secretariat and its distinguished and diligent head, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the assistance they have rendered to the Organization during the past year.\n3.\tWe welcome the two new States of Vanuatu and Belize on their joining the United Nations, and we present our best wishes to them for the prosperity and wellbeing of their respective peoples.\n4.\tPeace, the raison d'etre and supreme purpose of the 1945 Charter, is a source of continuous concern for us, dominating our meetings and constantly challenging the ingenuity of our creative capacities.\n5.\tIt is natural that it should be thus, for, without exception, we are all here to speak of peace: to praise it, to call for it, and to defend it. All of us, every one, are unswerving protagonists in this common effort, and all conventionalism vanishes before that inevitable equality. We all have the right to express our opinions on the state of the world, where peace is concerned.\n\n6.\tIn this important field, the world is reeling from one shock after another. It is true that war, terror and crime cast shadows on our hopes, threaten them and even annihilate them. We need only go over the geography of our planet in order to find that every day violence reigns. We raise our voice here to denounce it, as in the case of Afghanistan, which has been trampled underfoot by the invasion of Soviet troops, or that of Kampuchea, which has been militarily occupied by Vietnamese forces. The Middle East and various regions of Africa are also hotbeds of tension jeopardizing world peace.\n7.\tIt is because every effort must be made to preserve peace that my delegation favors a proposal made by President Chun of the Republic of Korea aimed at bringing about a resumption of talks, at the highest level, with the People's Democratic Republic of Korea with a view to reaching an honorable solution that would ensure a peaceful future for the peninsula in which, in the not too distant past, the United Nations made such great efforts. The Koreans themselves must, in an independent and peaceful manner, resolve the question of Korea which for 36 years has been divided through direct negotiations between the North and the South of the peninsula. Accordingly, it would be most desirable for the Secretary General to continue the efforts that began in 1979.\n8.\tThe Americas are also feeling the scourge of violence. For more than two years the Republic of El Salvador has been prey to the ravages of a war of extermination, which is being encouraged by sinister designs of political domination. In keeping with its tradition of complete respect for the sovereignty of others, Paraguay rejects any attempt at bringing El Salvador under a power other than one that is freely and democratically chosen by the Salvadorian people themselves.\n9.\tAccordingly, because my country has consistently defended the principle of non-intervention and the Assembly will recall the case of Nicaragua, which in 1979 was notable for Paraguay's single and solitary vote we repudiate any attempt at foreign interference in that tormented sister Republic. It is a pleasure and a source of pride for me to say that the international position of my country in this regard has never wavered nor shifted one iota. We are faithful, loyal and convinced performers of our international commitments and the governing principles maintaining the dignity of nations.\n10.\tMy country has understandably taken an interest in everything which has to do with the law of the sea since the start of the conferences on that issue almost a quarter of a century ago. We are a country without a coastline, but our situation as a landlocked country is a challenge which we must meet with dauntless will. We must overcome the obstacles that limit our access to the sea and seek other benefits from it; thus, protected by the future convention, my country will at the appropriate time request the legitimate advantages to which it is entitled.\n\n11.\tOur position as a landlocked country has for a long time adversely affected the development of our country, which today, fortunately thanks to the patriotic and extraordinary administration of the President of the Republic of Paraguay, General of the Army Alfredo Stroessner, and to the persevering efforts of my compatriots can point to highly significant indexes within the group of the countries of the American continent which accurately reflect the economic reality in Paraguay.\n12.\tAn annual growth rate of 10.4 per cent, a rate of inflation lower than 16 per cent, a favorable balance of payments for 10 years, per capita income above $1,000, an exchange rate between the guarani and the dollar which has remained practically unchanged for 20 years, a national budget without deficit and a considerable increase in exports all are eloquent data which we in Paraguay can show today\n13.\tAs has been so rightly stated by President Stroessner in his message last 1 April to the National Congress:\n... our powerful reality is the fruit of peace, which we have been able to affirm and which we are willing to defend with all our energy, without ever giving up in the struggle against factors which oppose our national greatness. We have replaced the opprobrious regime of anarchy by freedom with order. We are not interested in any democracy which means the weakness of free institutions and sterile demagoguery, For us, democracy represents the rule of the popular will within a framework of law. For us, freedom means the reconciliation of all rights with a view to the common good.\\\"\n14.\tThe Government of President Stroessner has a foreign policy based on full respect far the norms of international coexistence and the promotion of ties of solidarity with those countries which share the same ideals of independence, democracy and freedom.\n\n15.\tParaguay has throughout its history maintained a well-defined American position, which in the course of this century has led it to take an active part in all political and economic organizations which have been established in the continent and to which we naturally belong by reason of geography or trade links.\n16.\tBy reason of the same principles of solidarity and integration, Paraguay participates in the River Plata Basin System, in order to speed up the economic and social development of one of the potentially most wealthy regions in Latin America. With regard to specific achievements, my country has begun construction of two major hydroelectric plants on the Parana River one in conjunction with Brazil, which will have an installed capacity of 12,6 million kilowatts and the other with Argentina, with an installed capacity of 4.2 million kilowatts. These major sources of energy open up tremendous possibilities for the River Plata basin and will be true monuments to the fruitful and creative peace in which many million people will live. This is our significant contribution to the wellbeing and progress of mankind.\n17.\tI cannot, nor should I, end this brief statement without replying to the injudicious speech one more example of the truculent Castrist verbal diarrhea to which we are accustomed made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba yesterday [12th meeting].\n18.\tThe policy of open criminal interference in the internal affairs of other States practiced by Fidel Castro, a kindred satellite of a superPower, was experienced by Paraguay in 1959 and in 1960 when international brigands who entered our country across the long border with Argentina were found to be in possession of weapons and equipment belonging to the Cuban army. That attempted invasion, the sinister design of which was to bring communism to my country, was severely repulsed by the Paraguayan people themselves taking up arms and by the regular army of the nation. Paraguay severed diplomatic and consular relations with Cuba in 1960 and ever since then has maintained unchanged its position of repudiation of Fidel Castro's bloody tyranny. My country never compromised by granting that regime concessions which proved fatal for other nations of the Americas. That is why we are not surprised or frightened by the bullying attitude of the arrogant Minister,\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed a great personal privilege and honorF for me to be the first Prime Minister of Thailand to address this Assembly. I am here, on behalf of the people of Thailand, to pay a deserving tribute to the United Nations and its achievements. We do so under the compelling mandate of our history: the history of a sovereign nation with a longstanding commitment to the ideals of international peace, cooperation and harmony; a nation resolved to do its share and discharge its obligations as a responsible member of the community of States, be they obligations to peace and security or obligations in the economic, social or humanitarian fields. Equally important, we are a nation truly thankful for the degree of international order thus far achieved in place of the anarchy which might otherwise have ensued, had it not been for the way that the United Nations, time and.time again, refused to yield with regard to its principles.\n4.\tDespite the inherent limitations that beset the Organization at its present stage of development, the people of Thailand, as one of the peoples of the United Nations, joins me in reaffirming to you, Mr. President, our continuing commitment to the United Nations. We thank the Organization for its guiding influence in the search for solutions to the problems in our region and for its crucial role in averting a major human tragedy in oV part of the world. Above all, we reaffirm our faith m the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and pledge our continuing cooperation with all peace-loving Member States and with the Organization. The people of Thailand says that with conviction and a clear mandate from history.\n5.\tOn this occasion, therefore, I have the honor to convey to you my delegation's as well as my own warm greetings and sincere congratulations on your election to the high office of President of this General Assembly. We are indeed fortunate to have presiding over our deliberations such an experienced diplomat and dedicated internationalist as yourself, especially at a time of heavy schedules and difficult circumstances. We are also gratified to see a President who comes from a country with which Thailand entertains cordial relations and which, is also a fellow Asian State and member of the third world. My delegation is confident that under your wise guidance our proceedings will be fully successful.\n6.\tI also wish to pay a warm tribute to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, President of the thirty-fifth, session, for his statesmanlike conduct of the proceedings of that session and of the special sessions. The Organization has witnessed an eventful year and has relied more than ever on the General Assembly as its forum for the consideration of various important issues. Mr. von Wechmar provided the requisite leadership and performed his duty with great distinction. He thus earned our profound gratitude.\n7.\tThe delegation of Thailand is highly gratified to see two new Member States at this session taking their rightful places, namely, Belize and Vanuatu. We offer their respective delegations our sincere congratulations and wish to convey to their peoples our good wishes as well as the warm and friendly greetings of the people of Thailand.\n8.\tThe Organization is fortunate to have as its Secretary-General Mr. Kurt Waldheim, especially during the past year. His sensitive and skilfullF handling of world problems, as well as his dedicated efforts in administering the Organization, have earned the deep respect and admiration of the Government and people of Thailand.\n9.\tDespite his tireless endeavors, however, many critical and complex issues persist in various parts of the world. Even though there are certain matters which Governments in their wisdom have chosen to keep outside the purview of the United Nations, it would still be impossible to enumerate all the weighty issues brought to the doorstep of the world Organization. A brief glance at the agenda will be sufficient to provide some idea of the expectations that the world has of the Organization and its Secretary-General. It may also be true to say that many items remain on the agenda because they are intractable issues. This adds not only to the burden of the Organization but also to a sense of frustration shared by us all.\u2003\n10.\tThe eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, devoted to Namibia, which concluded recently, focused world attention once again on that important problem, which has been with the United Nations since its inception. In this regard, the legitimate rights and aspirations of the Namibian people remain thwarted by South Africa, which illegally occupies Namibia and uses the Territory as a springboard for aggression against its neighbors. Thailand's consistent policy is to demand the cessation of South Africa's illegal acts and its complete Withdrawal from the entire Territory of Namibia without further delay, so as to enable the Namibian people to exercise their right to self-determination. That is why Thailand was pleased to support the proposal made by the group of African States to convene the emergency special session, as well as to render further support during that session to the worthy cause of Namibian freedom and independence. Since Thailand has scrupulously abide by the relevant United Nations resolutions on this question and has for several years voluntarily imposed a trade embargo against Pretoria, my delegation was able to vote in favor of General Assembly resolution ES8/2 and the call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa.\n11.\tThailand wishes strongly to urge once again that the Western contact group renew its efforts to bring about an unconditional implementation of the United Nations plan on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). If a peaceful solution on the basis agreed upon by all parties is further delayed, then the alternative of an intensified armed struggle, under the recognized leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], will gain credibility as the only viable solution.\n12.\tAnother problem which has been a matter of grave concern to this Organization from the outset is the situation in the Middle East. The seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly, held in July 1980, on the question of Palestine, the recent air attacks on Iraq's nuclear facilities and on the population centers in Lebanon by Israeli war planes, and the protracted war between Iran and Iraq are further manifestations of the disturbing situation in the Middle East. The Palestinian people continue to suffer from denial of their right of self-determination, and Israel continues to occupy Arab territories and to disregard the relevant United Nations resolutions. Thailand joins the international community in reiterating its stand that Israel must withdraw from the Arab territories which it has occupied since the 1967 war, and refrain, in the mean time, from all measures designed to perpetuate its presence. Thailand is convinced that a just and lasting solution to the ArabIsraeli conflict must be based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967), with due recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, as well as the undeniable right of Israel to exist.\n13.\tEach of the foregoing situations has its origin in the denial of the right to self-determination of the Namibian people and of the Palestinian people, respectively. As long as the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa, on the one hand, and of Arab territories by Israel, on the other hand, are permitted to continue, a threat to international peace and security will exist. MajorPower rivalry will be exacerbated and will further complicate the search for a peaceful solution. Such situations may at\ntimes pose a challenge to the smaller Powers, especially those nearer the scene of conflict, to help arrest the escalation of the crisis. In so doing, they must act on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in order to safeguard their own vital interests. Such a role of power broker has been assumed, for instance, by the non-permanent members of the Security Council, and has proved to be not only useful, but sometimes the only means to avert a catastrophe.\n14.\tIn two other crisis areas, namely, Afghanistan and Kampuchea, there are also constructive roles for smaller countries, especially those situated near the scenes of conflict.\n15.\tIn Afghanistan, the situation directly involves a major Power, because of its armed intervention and occupation of that country, which has in turn resulted in increasing tension and rivalry. While the Islamic countries seem fully intent on dampening down such rivalry, they are conscious of the real issue, namely, the foreign occupation which deprives the Afghan people of their right to self-determination. Thailand's position is to support, wholeheartedly the right of the Afghan people to determine their own future free from external interference and coercion. In this respect, Thailand joins in urging the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, as well as in calling on all concerned to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non aligned status of Afghanistan.\n16.\tIn SouthEast Asia, the situation in Kampuchea continues to be of serious concern not only to Thailand, which is in the front line, but also to the international community. The foreign invasion and illegal occupation of that nonaligned country have disrupted the growing cooperation among the countries of .SouthEast Asia, and have led to a more intensified involvement and rivalry among the major Powers. It follows therefore that, so long as the Kampuchean problem remains unsolved, the proposal of the five member countries of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN] to establish a zone of peace in South East Asia cannot be implemented. However, my delegation believes that it is not too late to try to reverse this unfortunate situation. That is why the ASEAN countries have made strenuous efforts, together with other peace-loving nations of the world, to bring about a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the Kampuchean problem.\n17.\tThailand is indeed gratified at the outcome of the International Conference on Kampuchea, which was convened by the Secretary-General in New York in July of this year.\n18.\tThe Conference adopted the Declaration on Kampuchea and a resolution on Kampuchea,  reaffirming the fundamental principles, as well as providing a reasonable framework for a comprehensive political settlement, and outlining some modalities for achieving a just and durable solution of the Kampuchean problem. In the Declaration, adopted by consensus, the Conference took note of the serious international consequences of the situation in Kampuchea, in particular the escalation of tension in SouthEast Asia and major Power involvement as a result of this situation. The Conference stressed its conviction that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea. \nthe restoration of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the commitment by all States to nonintervention in the internal affairs of Kampuchea are the principal components of any just and lasting solution to the Kampuchean problem. The Conference emphasized that Kampuchea, like all other countries, has the right to be independent and sovereign, free from any external threat or armed intervention, free to pursue its own development and a better life for its people in an environment of peace, stability and full respect for human rights. To this end, the Conference called for negotiations on the following important elements: a ceasefire and withdrawal of all foreign forces, under United Nations supervision; measures for the maintenance of peace and order in Kampuchea; and the holding of free elections under United Nations supervision. The Conference also deemed it essential to have agreement on appropriate arrangements to ensure that the result of the free elections will be respected by all parties, as well as agreements by other States concerned to ensure peaceful and stable conditions fox Kampuchea.\n19.\tIn the resolution on Kampuchea, also adopted by consensus, the Conference established an Ad Hoc Committee to assist the Conference and to undertake missions, where appropriate, in pursuit of the worthy goal. The Ad Hoc Committee has already held an informal meeting at United Nations Headquarters and has agreed to convene its first formal meeting during the current session of the General Assembly. My delegation places its confidence in the ability of the Ad Hoc Committee, and its individual members, to play a useful role in carrying out its mandate.\n20.\tThailand feels that the international community owes its grateful thanks to Mr. Willibald Pahr, President of the International Conference on Kampuchea, for his leadership, as well as to the Secretary-General for convening the Conference after the widest possible consultations and careful preparations. The results of the Conference, which was attended by an overwhelming majority of Member States, mark a constructive beginning in our common search for a peaceful solution of the Kampuchean conflict in keeping with the principles of the Charter and the relevant United Nations resolutions. My delegation hopes that the General Assembly this year will endorse those results and will proceed to build on that reasonable foundation.\n21.\tOne of the most tragic consequences of the conflict in Kampuchea, as well as the recent fighting in other IndoChinese States, has been the IndoChinese refugee problem. Today, there are half a million IndoChinese displaced persons from Kampuchea, Laos and Viet Nam in the holding centers in Thailand and in encampments along the ThaiKampuchean border. This human tragedy has caused much suffering and created both internal and external problems for Thailand as well. Thanks to international assistance, such problems have been somewhat alleviated, but the unresolved situation calls for further assistance from the international community. Thailand's economic and social circumstances will not permit its Government and people to carry this tremendous burden for an indefinite period of time. It should be recognized that the problem is one of international .concern and its ultimate solution depends on a comprehensive political settlement, particularly of the Kampuchean conflict. That is another reason why my Government has spared no effort in trying to achieve a peaceful solution for Kampuchea. We appeal once again to all members of the world community to support our endeavors and, pending such a settlement and the safe return of the refugees to their homes, the international programs of assistance for the IndoChinese displaced persons in Thailand as well as along the ThaiKampuchean border should continue. Meanwhile, I wish to reiterate our sincere appreciation of the support we have received in this regard from the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, the various United Nations agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and all the voluntary agencies concerned, as well as from the donor Governments and their generous peoples.\n22.\tThailand's agreement to offer a temporary refuge to IndoChinese displaced persons is a manifestation of its humane policies, which are evident in another important area, namely, its campaign to eradicate the problems of drug abuse and illegal trafficking in narcotics. Here, too, cooperation between Thailand and other countries in and outside the region is essential. The Royal Thai Government has, therefore, entered into agreements with the United Nations and other countries concerned in order to maximize the effect of its anti-narcotics programs. Although there is relatively limited cultivation of the opium poppy in Thailand itself, my Government, which has been inspired by the projects of His Majesty the King, has undertaken a large-scale crop-substitution program in the hill-tribe areas of northern Thailand, with assistance and financial support from the United Nations and some friendly Governments. The real problem, however, is that of trafficking in heroin and other derivatives across dense jungles and rugged mountains into Thailand and beyond. It is not a simple matter for countries with limited resources to interdict traffic in narcotics in remote parts of their territories. However; international cooperation, assisted by the dedication and serious purpose of my Government, has thus far yielded encouraging results and should therefore be further strengthened, in order to spare mankind the dangers of drug abuse.\n23.\tThe ability of smaller countries to carry out their well-meaning policies and programs is circumscribed by their capacity to tackle the pressing economic and social issues of the day. The plight of less developed countries, which share similar problems and conditions, has long been on the world agenda. Indeed, approximately 80 per cent of the entire budget of the United Nations system is devoted to tasks of economic and social development. However, there are more than 800 million people still living in abject poverty on this planet, and the irony is that, by the end of the Third United Nations Development Decade, their number will have increased to over a billion.\n24.\tAt the same time, annual world expenditure on weapons has risen to $500 billion and is showing no signs of abating. In this connection, my delegation hopes that the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, to be convened in June next year, will succeed in reaching some of its goals. \n25.\tRising expenditure on arms is symptomatic of a troubled world and the consequent preoccupation with national security. It is, therefore, imperative that the root causes of international conflicts must be eliminated in order to lessen the inherent dangers and to release greater resources for constructive purposes. Among the basic causes of conflict are the economic discrepancy and exploitation prevailing among nations. Thus, the vicious circle is completed and we must devote our untiring efforts to breaking the cycle of poverty existing in the larger part of the world.\n26.\tThailand is a developing country and a member of the third world. While external circumstances have compelled my Government to increase its defense expenditure, the fact remains that the greater part of the national budget is earmarked for economic and social development, particularly in the rural areas of the country. The 19821986 Fifth Economic Plan aims at maintaining the growth rate of our economy in real terms in the neighborhood of 6 to 7 per cent per annum. During the past decade, the average growth rate of Thailand's economy of more than 7 per cent should indicate the level of its economic performance, despite worldwide economic problems and the severe energy crisis. However, there are new and unexpected problems, such as the refugee problem, as well as the implications of a population growth rate of approximately 2.5 per cent per annum. Dependence on oil imports also represents a heavy burden on our economy, although this is gradually being lessened by the availability of offshore natural gas and other new and renewable domestic sources of energy. Moreover, since most of our export commodities are affected by price fluctuations and trade barriers imposed by the industrialized countries, our terms of trade have deteriorated. Therefore, to supplement our internal efforts, we need to rely on appropriate actions in international forums, particularly in the establishment of a new international economic order and the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Closer cooperation in economic and technical fields among the developing countries themselves can also open up new possibilities and serve as a viable alternative.\n27.\tInterdependence among countries is a reality, not a mere slogan. Nations may ignore this fact only at their peril. Major issues, too, are interdependent, be they in the fields of trade, investment, technology, money or finance and development. Tackling these issues requires a true meeting of minds at the global level. The interdependence of problems means that there can be no fragmentation of interests and concerns. In other words, reshaping a new economic framework demands an integrated and comprehensive approach. The program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order was adopted in recognition of the momentous and dynamic changes already influencing the entire international economic landscape. The new order was to effect such changes in a comprehensive and integrated manner, thereby attempting to ward off the; adverse consequences that disorderly changes would bring.\n28.\tNevertheless, the last of the diminishing opportunities for a sustained and constructive dialog on the global level between developed and developing countries was lost when efforts to launch a new round of global negotiations failed, both at the eleventh special session and at the thirty-fifth session. Continued endeavors on the part of the Group of 77 and many of its friends to achieve some forward movement have encountered various moves to procrastinate. Resolution 34/138 was adopted by consensus in the Assembly two years ago. As of today, only a name the United Nations conference for global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development has been agreed upon.\n29.\tIt spite of the discouraging trends in present day international economic cooperation, Thailand remains prepared to play the constructive role it has been playing in all United Nations forums. The policy of my Government calls for greater cooperation with other developing countries in efforts to bring about a better life and greater human dignity for our respective peoples. We shall continue to play oUr part so that the worthy goals of a restructured world economy can eventually be achieved.\n30.\tIt is our fervent hope that after the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held soon at Cancun, all parties concerned will be more \\\"willing and ready to proceed with pending international negotiations and concrete actions in many forums, on such matters as dealing with new and renewable sources of energy on the basis of the Nairobi program of Action and the resolutions adopted by the United Nations conference in August this year, the question of science and technology for development and the pending issues at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. In all these matters, my delegation wishes to urge the industrialized countries to heed the voice of reason and to have the necessary foresight so that they may see that all mankind will be the ultimate beneficiaries. The world cannot survive a nuclear holocaust; nor can it survive a struggle of attrition between the rich minority and the overwhelming majority who are poor. The human community must rise above the confines of self-interest. The United Nations can still.provide Governments with a useful forum as well as a framework not only for the tasks of identifying and focusing world attention on issues, but also for the search for peaceful solutions for such issues. Given the necessary goodwill and political will, States can overcome their differences in the interest of all. Thailand will not be found wanting in that regard.\n"

        "file_text": "\n1.\tEach session of the General Assembly of the Organization, whose universality remains its underlying moral justification, provides us with the opportunity to question ourselves about the political, economic, social, cultural and human future of our planet on the basis of the balance sheets of the international situation which, one by one, we each draw up. This is perhaps why the general debate may give an impression of repetition, not only year after year but also speaker after speaker. This is, however, only an impression.\n2.\tIn my own case, although this is the sixth time I have had the signal honor to speak, on behalf of my country and its Head of State, Mr. Omar Bongo, to the Assembly, I do not in any way feel that I am repeating myself. Even less do I feel that I am listening to the same litanies. This is owing to the wide range of subjects and their fluidity.\n3.\tIn the past, we have had the opportunity to take up such enduring items as the deterioration of the international situation, security, detente, the persisting tensions among nations, the deterioration in the terms of trade, the growing inequality between rich and poor and the need for the establishment of a new, more just and more humane world order.\n4.\tThis is why, in the face of increasing risks of conflagration in a world that is prey to crises and turmoil, it is incumbent upon all of us gathered here to find appropriate ways and means to avoid the irreparable. This is a responsibility which we cannot shirk. \n5.\tThe Gabonese delegation, for its part, is participating in the current session, as it has in previous sessions, imbued with the firm desire to make its contribution to the construction of peace, justice and human dignity in order to ensure a better world. It is this meaning that we intend to impart to our statement.\n6.\tHowever, at the outset I should like to convey to you, Mr. President, on behalf of my delegation, our warmest congratulations upon your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is an indication of our trust in you, which is wholly in keeping with your outstanding qualities and with the competence, each of us is pleased to recognize in you. Hie Gabonese delegation is convinced that under your presidency the Assembly will steer the work of the present session towards the successful results which the entire international community is seeking.\n7.\tI should like to assure you that my delegation will give you its full support in the discharge of your weighty but ennobling and delicate mission. Our congratulations are extended also to the other officers of the Assembly, who, we are convinced, will contribute together with yourself to the success of our deliberations.\n8.\tIt is a pleasure for us to avail ourselves of this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Mr. Riidiger Von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, a talented diplomat, for his outstanding services to the international community, thanks in particular to the farsightedness, effectiveness and devotion with which he discharged his important responsibilities. We should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the SecretaryGeneral of the Organization. My Government is particularly grateful for his tireless efforts to find answers to the many questions which remain before the community of nations.\n9.\tLastly, we should like to extend a warm welcome to the delegations of Vanuatu and Belize upon their admission as the one hundred fifty-fifth and one hundred fifty sixth Members of the Organization. The membership of the Organization has thereby been strengthened and brought closer to universality. We should like to welcome these friendly countries to our midst and wish them full success in their efforts to contribute to our joint search for the advent of a peaceful world, a world of solidarity, a better world.\n555\nA/36/PV.27\n10.\tTo be sure, the principal aim of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security and to achieve cooperation among nations, all the while providing a center in which joint efforts may be brought into harmony. Unfortunately, the balance sheet of the world situation forces us once again to note that the current session of the General Assembly is being held at a moment of particular concern in the history of mankind, one marked by serious tensions and conflicts as well as by economic disorders which generate the poverty of which the third world in general and Africa in particular are the principal victims.\n11.\tIn Africa, one of the main subjects .of concern for our States, above and beyond any other, remains the situation in southern Africa, particularly in Namibia, a Territory still under colonial domination in spite of relevant United Nations resolutions which the racist authorities of Pretoria continue to defy.\n12.\tAs long as Namibia remains under the domination of South Africa and as long as the racist and fascist Government of Pretoria continues to impose upon the black majority its regime of apartheid, the work of decolonization and the liberation of Africa will not have been completed.\n13.\tWe cannot repeat often enough that the key to a rapid solution of the problem is firmly in the hands of the SoufE African Government and the countries of the Western contact group and that the basis thereof is Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which endorses the plan for the settlement of the question of Namibia.\n14.\tIn truth, throughout this year, at New Delhi in February at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of NonAligned Countries, at Nairobi in June at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, at Algiers in April at the Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of NonAligned Countries on the Question of Namibia, and in Paris in May, where, under the aegis of the Organization of African Unity [CMC/] and the United Nations, the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa was held in short, everywhere Africa and the nonaligned countries have unanimously supported resolution 435 (1978).\n15.\tBy allowing the South African Government to impose its delaying tactics and its policy of refusal and procrastination, the countries of the contact group are bearing a heavy responsibility, both in the tragedy in Namibia and in the invasion of Angola by South African troops. That is why they must pull themselves together and proceed actively to have Pretoria agree to implement the United Nations settlement plan so that the Namibian people can freely exercise its right to self-determination.\n16.\tFor its part, Gabon, which has, in an official statement by its Head of State, Mr. Omar Bongo, strongly condemned the invasion of Angolan territory, reaffirms its unreserved support for the United Nations plan and remains convinced that on that basis Namibia will soon achieve independence in its entirety, including its vital port of Walvis Bay. It is in the interests of the entire international community for this to be the case, because there can be no doubt whatsoever that the problem of Namibia carries the seed of generalized conflict which brings to bear upon mankind the threat of nuclear war. While it may be comforting from some angles to note that the Western countries have never opposed resolution ES8/2 adopted at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, convened here in September of this year, none the less, those countries must respond positively to the request made of them by the broad majority of the international community by imposing against South Africa the mandatory global sanctions stipulated in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. They must exert upon that country any other pressure necessary to ensure that it will comply.\n17.\tThat is the meaning of the appeal which, on behalf of the Head of State of Gabon, I would address to the Assembly. May this appeal be heard in the interests of safeguarding peace and security in Africa and in the world.\n18.\tIn South Africa itself, \\\"our brothers ... are continuing to be afflicted by domination, oppression and humiliation imposed upon them by the Pretoria regime which has inscribed in its institutions in letters of gold the fact that apartheid is the best way to organize economic, social and political space, and the recent electoral consultation constitutes it's latest shameful demonstration. That extract from the message from the President of the Gabonese Republic, addressed to the President of the International Conference on Sanctions Against South Africa, on Africa Liberation Day, on 25 May last, demonstrates the extent to which Gabon stands in solidarity with the fraternal people of South Africa in its struggle for liberation. That is why my country considers that the international community should support the legitimate struggle of the freedom fighters, while continuing to seek any peaceful solution which may lead to the rapid eradication of the shameful system of apartheid.\n19.\tIn central Africa, the situation in Chad, by reason of a long fratricidal war, concerns us deeply. At Nairobi, OAU once again considered this problem and Gabon responded to the appeal for solidarity which was made at that time.\n20.\tWith regard to an improvement of the situation in Chad, my country considers that this is a problem which should interest all of us. It hopes very much that the international community will rally to support this fraternal country to help it to rebuild its economy.\n21.\tUnfortunately, Africa is not the only part of the world in which confrontation continues, or where efforts to achieve the peaceful settlement of conflicts, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, have as yet been unsuccessful.\n22.\tThe situation in the Middle East appears to be a matter of increasing concern since the continuing tension in that part of the world, which in three decades has experienced three lethal wars, constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. The atmosphere of violence, as well as Israel's refusal to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, frequently reaffirmed by relevant resolutions of the United Nations, are hardly conducive to settling the conflict by peaceful means. Gabon believes in the virtues of dialog as a privileged weapon for the settlement of conflicts among States and will continue to encourage any initiative to achieve a settlement of the Palestinian problem by means of negotiation.\n23.\tThat is why it considers that the search for a just and lasting peace in that part of the world requires the effective participation of the Palestinian people in any peace process, as well as the full and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from the Arab territories occupied in 1967, and the exercise by the Palestinian people of its national rights.\n24.\tThat is also why Gabon will continue to condemn the Hebrew State as long as Israel which, it must be recognized, does have the right to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized boundaries refuses to abide by Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). .\n25.\tAt this point it seems quite appropriate to refer to the bloody and prolonged tragedy in Lebanon. I should like to state here that my country vehemently condemns foreign aggression and acts of intervention, of whatever form or on whatever pretext, which would threaten the integrity, independence and sovereignty of that State.\n26.\tThese principles are valid wherever tensions or conflicts exist. In addition to the problems that we have mentioned, we have in mind in this connection, the following: the situation in Cyprus, where talks between the communities should continue; the Korean problem, with regard to which Gabon Supports any action leading to reunification of the peninsula by peaceful means, without any foreign interference; Kampuchea and Afghanistan, where the peoples must be able to express their views freely to decide the system of government they desire; and, finally, Iraq and Iran, two fraternal countries at war, to whom we renew the appeal that the Head of State of Gabon, Hajji Omar Bongo, made to them to put an end to their conflict.\n27.\tThe establishment of peace in these regions of tension and upheaval should reinforce the process of generalized detente that the world seeks and should put an end to the arms race, a race of increasingly sophisticated and lethal weapons. The senseless accumulation of weapons may at any moment provoke a planetary cataclysm. In a world of anxiety and intolerable, destabilizing pressures, a simple error or thoughtless action may lead to a nuclear apocalypse.\n28.\tIn such circumstances, we must all strive to put an end to this accumulation of weapons, so as finally to eliminate this danger. The matter is to be considered at the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which is to be convened soon. The huge sums so far devoted to weapons could be allocated to financing humanitarian activities, that is to say, the advancement of the developing countries, the improvement of health and education and a reduction in social inequalities.\n29.\tThat was the principal aim of the Disarmament Decade decreed in December 1969 by the General Assembly [see resolution 2602 E (XXIV)].\n30.\tSince it is now time to prepare a balance sheet, let us at the outset say that this decade has been a negative one. This year, according to the best informed sources, more than $500 billion have been devoted to military expenses, that is, an expenditure of approximately $1 million per minute. At the same time, thousands of men, women and children continue to die every day of hunger and poverty, in the face of almost total indifference.\n31.\tThat is why we consider that the question of disarmament is closely linked to the question of development; it is so true that the maintenance of the status quo consolidates inequalities, is a factor of tension in the world and also of deterioration of the world economic situation.\n32.\tThe economic development of States remains the best guarantee for general and lasting security and true and total freedom.\n33.\tIt must be noted that the world economic crisis has assumed unprecedented dimensions. No one can doubt that the world economy is currently experiencing the most serious crisis since the Second World War. The substantial slowdown in economic activity, the increased deterioration in terms of trade, runaway inflation and the rising costs of the foreign debt of the third world countries surely point to an extremely disturbing situation; at least that is true of most of us and some of us are already familiar with the critical phase of zero growth.\n34.\tThat is why Gabon was particularly interested in the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris in September this year, which endorsed the concerns expressed by those countries.\n35.\tThat is why we are pleased to note that the developed countries accepted what is self-evident when they stated their readiness to increase their bilateral and multilateral aid to the least developed countries, by doubling their contributions in order, as they emphasized, to avoid any increase in the international economic imbalance.\n36.\tMoreover, it must be recognized that the desired return to normal growth has not taken place and there has been a general disorganization of the world economy, thereby confirming the urgent need for a structural modification that would be in the interests not only of the developing countries but also of the developed countries.\n37.\tThis evolution has led to a wide-ranging awareness among all peoples of the fact that the current international economic situation is inequitable as far as the benefits of economic relations between the developed and developing countries are concerned.\n38.\tThe structural changes that we seek must be made with regard to production, consumption and world trade so as to enable the developing countries to exercise effective control over their raw materials and to participate fully in the international decision-making process.\n39.\tGabon places high hopes in the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held soon at Cancun. In any case, it hopes that the high-level officials participating in that conference will take that opportunity to establish a new atmosphere that will make it possible for global negotiations to be initiated as speedily as possible.\n40.\tIf there is a problem that is of particular concern to my country it is that of new and renewable sources of energy, a problem which was taken up at the conference held last August at Nairobi, under the aegis of the United Nations.\n41.\tOn that occasion, Gabon, which has several sources of energy, the most important of which are water energy, solar energy, biomass and wood, and which has therefore always attached particular importance to the post-oil period, demonstrated its interest in the advent of this new era.\n42.\tThe industrialized countries and international organizations must concentrate on finding sources to finance programs to promote and develop new and renewable sources of energy recognized as indispensable for the world economy. This is a matter that was left in abeyance at Nairobi.\n43.\tI do not wish to conclude my statement without referring to the serious question of the food and agriculture\nsituation throughout the world, particularly in Africa, where the food outlook appears to be extremely grave.\n44.\tThe international community must actively contribute to solving this extremely important problem and to defining new directions regarding food and agriculture.\n45.\tIt must be recognized that the picture of the international situation that we have just drawn, both politically and economically, is hardly a matter for rejoicing.\n46.\tNevertheless, it is comforting to note that the Organization, however well founded criticism of it may be, has since the last war provided a privileged framework for the safeguarding of peace throughout the world and the definition of new strategies for multilateral cooperation.\n47.\tLet us transcend our selfish interests and bear in mind only the interests of mankind as a whole by translating the decisions of the Organization into political and economic facts so that this new world order for which we tirelessly call may finally be established.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "182.\tI should like at the outset to offer you my warm congratulations, Sir, on the occasion of your election as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session. Your wide experience and valuable contribution to the work of the Organization over many years will be of great benefit to the work of this session, which we hops will succeed in serving the cause of peace and international cooperation, in affirmation of the principles and goals of the United Nations. Your presidency is a positive indication of the increasing role played by our brother State of Iraq and by the Arab group as a whole in contributing to the attainment of the goals of the Organization and the strengthening of its efforts for the prosperity and wellbeing of the world.\n183.\tI also wish to offer my thanks and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, for conducting the work of the General Assembly at its previous session with ability and dedication. I should not fail to pay a tribute, in the name of the delegation of Bahrain, to the efforts and the performance of the SecretaryGeneral, who has contributed so much over the last 10 years to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the accomplishment of its goals and in facing the many serious challenges that have confronted it. This praiseworthy effort deserves our deepest gratitude.\n184.\tI should also like to welcome the admission of both Vanuatu and Belize to membership in the Organization. We hope that it will not be long before we see the national liberation movements, that sit with us now as observers, occupying their seats as Members, after their struggling peoples have triumphed over imperialism, occupation and racism and obtained their legitimate rights to freedom, self-determination and independence for there is no doubt that the will of peoples who are fighting to attain their legitimate rights will inevitably triumph.\n185.\tThe thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is meeting in a world beset by burning international issues which threaten international peace and security, where serious international crises may break out at any moment in the most sensitive areas of the world. World economic conditions arc in no better state than the political situation and they are no less important.\n186.\tUnder such circumstances, it is incumbent more than ever upon the United Nations to play a greater role in the resolution of the international problems which confront mankind, so that international relations may be maintained in order to meet the serious challenges which face our world. We therefore consider it the duty of the General Assembly to review and examine carefully the events of today's world in order to assess their effects on the life of mankind and their implications for the future, and so avoid their possible dangerous consequences. In this context, we face many questions which require satisfactory answer with regard to the problems that confront mankind, and foremost among these are the following. How are we to eliminate hotbeds of tension and conflict in the world, maintain detente, increase confidence between the two superPowers and strengthen international peace and security? How are we to stop the arms race, particularly in the field of weapons of mass destruction, put an end to all forms of hegemony, domination and subjugation by the great Powers and narrow the gap that still exists between the rich and ti ~ poor? And how are we to put an end to imperialism in ah its forms, particularly the colonialist and racist imperialism practiced by Israel and South Africa?\n187.\tThese and other questions require, in our opinion, careful and thorough scrutiny by the family of nations in this troubled period in the history of international relations. No effective and satisfactory solutions can be found to such problems except through constructive dialog and a genuine desire to abide by the principles of the United Nations and respect for the right of peoples to self-determination.\n188.\tWe live in critical international conditions marked by turbulence and ambiguity. It is no overstatement to say that we live in a world in which terror arising from the arms race and confrontation between the two superPowers prevails. Relations between the two superPowers over the last year have been marked by a return to the policy of the cold war and rivalry over spheres of influence in the world. The policy of recourse to the use of force has again taken the prominent place in modern international life a matter which is of concern to the world, and particularly to those States which have not aligned themselves with either of the two superPowers. The two superPowers are seeking to impose their policies of hegemony and to attract the developing countries both politically and economically, so as to use them as pawns in their game of power politics. There are still many areas in the world, including Europe itself, which are considered to be probable regions of wide-scale confrontation between the two superPowers if a radical change were to occur in the balance of power between them. Therefore, the developments which have occurred in the international arena are a source not so much of optimism as of caution and fear.\n189.\tWe have expressed on more than one occasion our opinion regarding the ways and means of building sound and equal international relations among States, irrespective of their political and economic status, in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations, with particular emphasis on the need to abandon the use or threat of use of force in international relations, to respect the sovereignty of States, the integrity of their territories, the sanctity of their borders, noninterference in their domestic affairs and equality of rights among them all. In the light of this, allow me to present my point of view with regard to current and pressing international issues and the developments which we consider to be of especial importance which have taken place since the last session.\n190.\tWe consider the establishment of the Gulf Cooperation Council by the Arab Gulf States an important and positive historic event in our region and a great step towards the fulfillment of the aspirations of the peoples of the region to strengthen their present and future ties. Following immediately upon the declaration establishing the Gulf Cooperation Council, the six States members of the Council the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain confirmed that the Council was not a group directed against anybody, and that it had been set up in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the non aligned movement. The Gulf Cooperation Council represents a political, economic and social grouping of the six member States designed to face up to the challenges and external threats which confront the region and to keep it away from spheres of influence and international strife.\n191.\tThe leaders of the six member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council emphasized in their final communique issued after their first conference, in Abu Bhabi on 26 May of this year, that the security and stability of the Gulf is the responsibility of the States of the region, that those States are capable of assuming that responsibility and that nobody has the right to interfere in their internal affairs. The rejection by the leaders of the region of any foreign intervention, whatever its source or nature, reaffirmed the determination of those States to resist all endeavors to link the region to international conflicts that are inconsistent with the principles of nonalignment and the Charter of the United Nations. The Gulf Cooperation Council, which reflects the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the region and highlights the historical, social and economic ties existing among them, is not only aimed at facing up to external challenges and threats, but also at developing self-sufficiency among those States in various fields of economic and social development, to strengthen peace and stability in the region and to contribute to the prosperity of the peoples of the Gulf and of the world at large.\n192.\tThe question of Palestine and the dispute in the Middle East have occupied a central place in international events this year. We do not need to repeat the details of the Palestinian question or its implications for the different elements involved, but it is necessary to highlight the importance of finding a rapid, just, lasting and comprehensive solution to this problem, considering its decisive impact on the maintenance of international peace and security.\n193.\tThe question of Palestine was and will remain at the core of the dispute in the Middle East. There will be no stability in the region if a just solution to that question is not found. The events in the Middle East and their consequences indicate that the conflict in the region has entered an extremely grave phase. It looked this year as if the Middle East were on top of a volcano that could have erupted at any moment. The perpetuation of the situation in the Middle East will provoke turmoil in the area, with all the resulting complications threatening world peace and exposing international relations to danger. The dangerous situation in the Middle East is the result of the continued occupation by the Zionist entity of Arab lands and the constant refusal of Israel to abide by United Nations resolutions, of that entity's confiscation of Arab lands, demolition of houses, building of settlements and colonies on occupied land, expulsion of the Arab inhabitants, violation of their human rights and subjecting them to all sorts of torture and humiliation, the eradication of Arab landmarks and the desecration of the holy places.\n194.\tThe continued profanation of the holy places by the Zionist occupation authorities, in particular the continuation of excavation under the Moslem Sanctuary of the Mosque of AlAqsa, proves the evil and aggressive intentions of the Zionists towards the holy places. It is a challenge to the feelings of all Moslems and a flagrant violation of the resolutions of the United Nations and UNESCO, which have declared Jerusalem and its ancient walls to be part of the heritage of mankind. We appeal to the world community to recognize the gravity of the excavations being carried out by the Zionist occupying authorities under the sacred Dome of the Rock, which are aimed at destroying one of the holiest places for Moslems in the Holy City of Jerusalem. The international community is therefore required to make an effective move to stop Israeli aggression against the holy places in the occupied Arab lands.\n195.\tAmong other new evidence of the expansionist and aggressive intentions of Israel in the region is its recent decision to proceed with the implementation of a plan to dig a canal linking the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea, commencing from the occupied Gaza Strip and going across the occupied West Bank and the Jordan Valley. We should like to bring to the attention of the world the gravity of that plan which is intended to bring about fundamental geographical, demographical, environmental and economic transformations that would have serious consequences for the entire region, and in particular for the inalienable rights of the Palestinians and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. We call upon all States and peoples to refrain from providing any assistance or support, financial or technical, for its implementation, failure to heed this call would be regarded as a hostile act against the rights of the Arab nations.\n196.\tThe international community has used all methods of condemnation, denunciation, censure and protest in regard to the continued Israeli aggression against Palestinian people and the neighboring Arab States, but it has not imposed any sanctions regarding such continued aggression a fact that has led Israel to perpetuate and expand its aggression. Unless the international community can restrain Israel by imposing on it economic and political sanctions, it will continue its aggression against the Palestinian people and the neighboring Arab States.\n197.\tThere is no need to recall the stand of Bahrain regarding this question and the need for a comprehensive and just solution. We have explained on more than one occasion that a just and durable peace in the region should be based on recognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of their own State, the recognition of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories, foremost among which is the Holy City of Jerusalem.\n198.\tIn accordance with those principles, Prince Fahd ibn Abdul Aziz, the Crown Prince of our brother country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, put forward an eight-point plan for a just and comprehensive solution of this question, which speedily met with a favorable response all over the world. The clearly formulated plan of Prince Fahd proves our deep conviction that our problems can be settled by peaceful means within the framework of the United Nations and international legality. Nevertheless, Israel remains silent and refuses to respond to any move towards peace. A further complication has arisen out of the announcement by the United States, which is considered to be a pillar of the Organization and a leader of the Western countries, that it intends to conclude an agreement on strategic cooperation with the Israeli aggressor, which is occupying the lands of others by force of arms and rejects all international values and principles. Undoubtedly, this will complicate matters further in that sensitive area of the world. We therefore call upon the international community to support the eight-point plan and upon the Security Council to adopt it as a framework for a just and comprehensive solution to this question.\n199.\tFor this purpose we support the call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, a conference in which the PLO would participate on an equal footing with the other parties, particularly in view of the fact that events in the Middle East have proved beyond any doubt the importance of the participation of the PLO in any process for the establishment of genuine peace in the region.\n200.\tIsrael is responsible for the serious tension prevailing in Lebanon which is exposed daily to Zionist aggression and its destructive effects. While we emphasize our concern for the independence of Lebanon, the integrity of its land and people and its sovereignty over all its territories, we see that this cannot be achieved unless an end is put to Israeli aggression which aims at setting fire to and destroying Lebanon. It has been learn by experience without any doubt over the last six years that Israeli aggression against Lebanon will intensify and increase every time that efforts to bring about peace in Lebanon approach success.\n201.\tTo rescue Lebanon from the ordeal which it has been through over the last six years is an Arab and a human goal. But Arab attempts to reach that goal have always been thwarted by Zionist designs aimed at perpetuating the ordeal of Lebanon in order to intensify domination over it and to keep the region continuously on the boil. In such circumstances we call upon all States and the Security Council to put effective pressure on Israel to make it stop its continued interference in Lebanon and aggression against that country.\n202.\tThe Israeli raid last June on the Iraqi nuclear research center, used for peaceful purposes, is a dangerous precedent in international relations and a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international norms. No. State in the world has ever perpetrated such an act of aggression; Israel is thereby trying to replace international law by the law of the jungle.\n203.\tIn fact, the deliberate and barbaric aggression committed by the Zionist entity against Iraq is an indivisible part of a plan to weaken, threaten and destabilize the Arab countries. It is a direct and serious threat to the present and future of the Arab nation, culturally, politically, economically and socially. The intention behind the Israeli raid on the Iraqi nuclear reactor is to prevent the Arab States from acquiring advanced technical knowledge. Israel intends by such aggression to convince the world that it is the supreme Power in the area and that it can force the Arab States to submit and surrender.\n204.\tBahrain, which has denounced and strongly condemned this unprovoked aggression, considered by all the States of the world, including the friends and supporters of Israel and those who defend it, to be an act of piracy and intimidation against our brother country, Iraq, would like to reaffirm once again its complete support for and solidarity with the Government and people of Iraq in then struggle against Zionist aggression.\n205.\tThis aggression has threatened the security and peace of the whole region and the international community should impose on Israel the sanctions prescribed in Chapter VII of the Charter. There is no doubt that the huge material and military support which is offered to Israel by the United States is the main reason for the perpetuation of Zionist aggression against the Arab States. The Zionist entity, in fact, would not have had the courage to perpetrate its aggression against our brother country, Iraq, but for the support Israel receives from some Western countries, particularly the United States.\n206.\tThe absence of international deterrence has encouraged Israel to persist in its arrogance and reliance on force to achieve its ambitions and expansionist goals. We call upon all States, particularly those that support the Zionist entity and supply it with economic, political and military assistance, foremost among which is the United States, to refrain from giving such assistance to Israel, in order for it to abandon its aggressive policy in the Middle East.\n207.\tMore than a year has passed since war broke out in the Gulf between our brother State of Iraq and the neighboring Moslem State of Iran. It is a matter which is of concern to our region and the whole world. We cannot hide our great anxiety and deep regret concerning that war waged between two Moslem countries with its excessive loss of life and the destruction of economic and architectural institutions and establishments in both countries.\n208.\tSince the war broke out we have appealed to both Moslem neighbors to cease hostilities and enter into peaceful, negotiations to settle the issues that caused the war and to find a just and final solution to the painful dispute between the two countries. We appeal again with all sincerity to both Iraq and Iran to stop the fighting and to settle the existing dispute between them by peaceful means, responding to the sincere offer of the good offices of the United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the nonaligned movement in the search for a peaceful and just solution of this problem. The response of Iraq to these initiatives has been encouraging and positive. We hope it will not be too long before peace prevails in both these neighboring countries.\n209.\tThe Afghan people are still resisting and rejecting the Soviet occupation of their country, which took place almost two years ago. The United Nations and other international bodies have called for the withdrawal of the armed forces from Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union has not responded to the appeals of the international community.\n210.\tIn this context I should like to reaffirm that the solution of the Afghan problem involves the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and the recognition of the right of the Afghan people to have the system of government of its choice in all freedom and without external interference, the maintenance of Afghanistan as an independent nonaligned country and the creation of the necessary favorable conditions for the return of the Afghan refugees to their homeland in dignity and safety.\n211.\tThe situation in southern Africa, and particularly in Namibia, is increasing in gravity and complexity. The hopes concerning the future of Namibia that were pinned on the Geneva pre-implementation meeting held at the beginning of this year have been disappointed because of the obduracy of the authorities in South Africa and their resistance to the efforts of the United Nations to secure the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In this context, we should like to confirm the support of Bahrain for the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its eighth emergency special session to give new momentum to the liberation of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO, the sole authentic representative of the people of Namibia. I should like also to declare our support for the legitimate struggle waged by the persecuted majority in South Africa against the policies of apartheid practiced by the racist minority regime in Pretoria. We also support the international call to impose mandatory sanctions against that racist regime to compel it to abide by the United Nations resolutions and we strongly condemn the cooperation and alliance existing between the racist regimes in South Africa and Israel.\n212.\tWe should like, in connection with the recent developments in the continent of Africa, to welcome in the name of Bahrain the decision reached by the OAU on Western Sahara. We hope that the proposal for a referendum submitted by our brother country, Morocco, on this problem at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity held at Nairobi in June last, will provide a favorable climate for ending that painful dispute.\n213.\tThe economic conditions and situation in the world are no less serious than the political situation referred to above. The world economic situation is in constant decline and only slight progress has been made towards the establishment of a new international economic order based on equity, justice and interdependence. It seems from the stand of the advanced industrialized countries that they pay no heed to the conclusions reached by the Brandt Commission, which emphasized the common destiny of humanity as a whole. There are still many regions in the world threatened with famine and drought, where millions of people die of starvation. This makes the beginning of the 1980s and the end of the twentieth century a dark era in the history of humanity. Unless the advanced industrialized countries increase the aid they give to the countries of the third world and listen to them more attentively, no tangible progress will be made towards the establishment of a new international economic order, particularly since the world economy is suffering from inflation, instability of prices and the devaluation of the currencies of the advanced industrialized countries, which has serious harmful effects on the economies of the developing countries.\n214.\tThe failure of the eleventh special session, devoted to global negotiations on the new international economic order, should not prevent efforts being made to carry out such negotiations. We hope that the economic summit meeting to be held this month at Cancun will produce positive results, leading to agreement between the advanced industrialized' countries and the developing countries on current economic problems.\n215.\tAmong the encouraging initiatives in the sphere of development and humanitarian aid is the establishment in Bahrain of the Arab Gulf program for United Nations development organizations, which aims at aiding developing countries by financing development and humanitarian projects to be carried out by the United Nations. This program was initiated by the allocation of $40 million to UNICEF, which is proof of the conviction of the founders of this program, namely the Arab Gulf States, that it is necessary to supply developing countries with financial aid and support United Nations development institutions.\n216.\tThe tenth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was held this year, has not resulted in the adoption of a general and comprehensive agreement on the law of the sea, but it has made progress in solving some of the hardcore issues. This leads us to hope that the Conference will be able to adopt the desired convention at its next session.\n217. Bahrain, as a peace-loving country, would like to be able to live in a world in which peace, freedom and dignity prevailed. We hope that this session will contribute to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the search for the necessary solutions to the problems facing the cause of peace, liberty and justice in the world. This can only be accomplished if all States are prepared to make a sincere and concerted effort to put an end to injustice, backwardness and domination. We know very well that this objective cannot be achieved overnight and that together we must make every effort to allow the family of nations to succeed, within the framework of the United Nations, in establishing an international community in which justice, peace and prosperity prevail.\n218. In this context, we should like to declare that the State of Bahrain is prepared to work with other peace loving nations within and outside the framework of the United Nations for the achievement of these noble goals and purposes.\n"

        "file_text": "148. It is my privilege, Sir, to proffer my delegation's sincere congratulations on your elevation to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We fully share the conviction repeatedly expressed by those who have spoken before us that under your eminent stewardship this session will undoubtedly be crowned with success.\n149.\tWe take off our hats to your equally illustrious predecessor for the brilliant manner in which he steered the deliberations of the thirty-fifth session. May he continue ,to shine in his new endeavors.\n150.\tWe are also in no small measure beholden to the SecretaryGeneral, who has selflessly continued to spend sleepless nights and restless days in the service of mankind.\n151.\tIt is with great pride and a sense of achievement that we welcome to our midst the Republic of Vanuatu. Every addition to the membership of this family of nations represents to us an additional nail in the coffin of colonialism.\n152.\tWe are equally proud to welcome to independence and freedom the new State of Belize, which came into being only 16 days ago. The people of Belize are free at last and we all have every reason to rejoice: We wish them a very happy future.\n153.\tBotswana continues to attach great importance to the annual sessions of this great assembly of nations. There is, in our view, some virtue in the ritual of speech making, in the festival of words in which we engage every year, for we know only too well that when nations stop talking they start fighting.\n154.\tGathered here today, as in the past, are nations big and small, rich and poor, weak and strong, brought together by their common desire and determination to nurture and preserve their collective freedom, independence and security under the protective umbrella of the United Nations. Of necessity, every year scores of presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers come on a pilgrimage to this meeting-place of nations to speak of peace and the brotherhood of man. This is as it should be, for the United Nations was founded precisely for the sole purpose of maintaining peace and security and fostering the growth of a spirit of mutual understanding among nations in a world scarred by two wars in this century alone.\n155.\tAnd yet a quick glance at the agenda will reveal that the foundations of peace are as weak as ever. Old issues still crowd the agenda of every session of the Assembly. The world in which we live, 36 years after the founding of the United Nations,' continues to be poised precariously on an increasingly fading borderline between peace and war, between order and chaos, between sanity and madness. The cold war between the East and the West has been given a new lease of life and is threatening to heat up as the two superPowers resume their deadly and wasteful competition for nuclear arms superiority. Billions of dollars are being wasted on a suicidal arms race at the end of which there will certainly be no winner. The superPowers already have in their possession a lethal arsenal more than sufficient to destroy each other and the rest of us many times over.\n156.\tInevitably, the escalation of the cold war has heightened tension all over the world, particularly in areas of endemic conflict such as southern Africa. That turbulent region of our continent has in recent months become a viciously contested area for contending seekers after geopolitical spheres of influence and may yet provide the spark to start the conflagration we have always feared and tried to avoid.\n157.\tThe problems of southern Africa are not insoluble. A racial conflagration is not necessarily inevitable in that area. For Namibia we have a plan which has been accepted by the parties concerned and endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978) and which must be implemented without any further delay if the patience of the oppressed is not to run out. There is still a great deal of goodwill among those who have waited so long for their freedom. The front-line States and Africa as a whole have invested a great deal of hope in the United Nations plan, not out of fear of the alternative path to Namibia's freedom but as a demonstration of our abiding faith in peaceful change and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.\n158.\tIt would be unfortunate, therefore, if our goodwill and our good faith were to be mistaken for capitulation or weakness. The five Western Powers, in particular, which labored so hard three years ago to produce the United Nations plan, ought to realize that within their grasp lies a golden opportunity to play an historic role in the peaceful liberation of Namibia before it is too late. They ought to realize that the permissiveness with which they have treated South Africa thus far can only stiffen that country's resolve to continue to gnaw at the very soul of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) until the resolution resembles some Bantustan plan. South Africa must be compelled to show good faith if SWAPO is to be expected to continue to be as reasonable as it has always been.\n159.\tThere has been a great deal of speculation in the media in the past few weeks about the imminence of a breakthrough in the stalemate that has characterized the period since the Geneva pre-implementation meeting. On 24 September, the five Western Powers met here in New York in an atmosphere of heightened expectation. Twelve days later we are still in a state of anticipation because what transpired at the meeting on 24 September remains shrouded in mystery. We have not lost hope, but there is up to now nothing to encourage us in our stubborn hopefulness. The onus is on the Five Powers to deliver South Africa and there is very little time in which to do so. The road of silent agony is by no means endless.\n160.\tThe stalemate in the Namibian negotiations has created a dangerous situation in our area. The recent invasion of Angola by South Africa, using Namibia as a launching pad, has not only betrayed Pretoria's sinister intentions vis-a-vis the whole situation in southern Africa; it has also in no small measure showed how close the area is to becoming a cockpit of superPower confrontation.\n161.\tSouth Africa has been very much encouraged by Washington's popular song about the presence of Cubans and Russians in Angola. The reported capture by South African terrorist troops of one Russian in southern Angola and the discovery of one bottle of vodka in the house he is alleged to have occupied seem to have been received well in the capitals of the Western world. Frantic attempts are now being made to blame Angola for acts committed by South Africa. Efforts are being* made to blame the Soviet Union and Cuba for acts of aggression committed by SoOth Africa.\n162.\tNeither the Cubans nor the Russians in Angola have ever posed a threat to the security or stability of southern Africa. On the contrary, they are in Angola precisely because, using Namibia as a military base, South Africa invaded Angola in 1975 and has continued to violate the territorial integrity of that country with impunity. Angola had every right to seek assistance from its friends and will continue to exercise that right so long as South African acts of aggression continue.\n163.\tSouth Africa has itself to blame for the political pollution in southern Africa. Angola is what it is because of the abortive attempt by South Africa in 1975 to destroy that country at birth. Namibia is in the mess it is in because for more than 60 years South Africa has used the Territory as if it were part of South Africa, in blatant defiance of the decisions of both the League of Nations and the United Nations. Southern Africa is in a state of turmoil because South Africa has decided to destabilize any country in the area which refuses to be cowed into submission in the struggle against apartheid and Pretoria's illegal occupation of Namibia.\n164.\tAnd yet all these provocations have not deterred and will not deter us from pursuing the cause of peace in Namibia as far as we possibly can. There can be a solution to the Namibian problem and, indeed, the plan exists to produce such a solution. The front-line States, Africa and SWAPO are more than ready to cooperate with the five Western Powers and the United Nations in the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) and thus end once and for all the sad Namibian saga.\n165.\tThe liberation of Namibia is, of course, inextricably bound up with the struggle against the pernicious ideology of apartheid in South Africa, where a stubborn white minority regime has elected to resist with all the power at its disposal every effort aimed at persuading it to abandon the suicidal course on which it set itself 33 years ago. The past four years have witnessed frantic attempts by the South African regime to convince the world that the white man cannot survive in South Africa without institutionalized racism. In other words, we are told that for the white man to survive in South Africa there must be racial discrimination in the country; blacks and whites must have separate toilets, separate bars, separate schools, separate residential areas and, indeed, separate cemeteries.\n166.\tNo, apartheid is inimical to the survival of the white man in South Africa. By refusing to recognize the aspirations of black South Africans, by depriving the black majority of its heritage, the citizenship of its own country, white South Africans have jeopardized their own survival in South Africa.\n167.\tSo have the people of Israel in the Middle East; they seem to have vowed never to live in peace with their neighbors, whose lands Israel has forcibly added to its own and continues to occupy in arrogant defiance of United Nations decisions. There can be no peace in the Middle East so long as Israel refuses not only to end its occupation of Arab lands, but also and this is crucial  to recognize the right of the people of Palestine to live as a free nation in its own independent sovereign State.\n168.\tThere can be no peace in the Middle East as long as Israel believes that its survival in that area depends entirely on its military might. The destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor does not in any way enhance the prospects for peace in the Middle East, nor does it ensure the survival of Israel. The systematic bombing of Lebanon by Israel can only accelerate the dangerous drift towards a bloody regional confrontation in the Middle East.\n169.\tYes, we remain committed to the survival of the State of Israel, but only within its pre-1967 boundaries. We also, with equal tenacity, remain committed to the struggle of the Palestinian people for freedom. It has every right to have a country it can truly call its own.\n170.\tOn the question of Korea, we believe it is only fair and just that we should leave the two parts of the divided country alone to solve, in peace and without any external interference of any kind, the problem of reunification. Both Koreas want reunification; it is only in the method of achieving the objective that the two sides may differ. The important thing, however, is that we should leave them alone to resolve their differences.\n171.\tAsia has its own problems. Afghanistan is still where it was when we met here last year. Soviet troops are still in the country in spite of our urgings that they be withdrawn. We insist that they be withdrawn so that the people of Afghanistan can decide on their own system of government.\n172.\tKampuchea also remains a tormented country. Vietnamese troops have no right to be there and must withdraw to Viet Nam, where they belong.\n173.\tMy delegation has no illusions that when we meet here at the thirty-seventh session some of the items we are dealing with this year might not be on the agenda of that session. Our earnest hope is that next year the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will conclude its work and that global negotiations on international economic cooperation will have been launched and will have made some progress. Otherwise, the struggle for the creation of a safer, saner and more just world must continue.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Guatemalan delegation, I am happy to congratulate Mr. Kittani on his election as President of the General Assembly for its thirty-sixth session.\n58.\tI also wish to express my satisfaction at the work done by his predecessor, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, who made a valuable contribution to the achievements of the preceding session.\n59.\tMy delegation joins in the expressions of appreciation addressed to the Secretary-General who, with his wide experience of international affairs, has so efficiently carried out his tasks.\n60.\tMy delegation considers it important to explain in this world forum the philosophy that inspires Guatemala in establishing its objectives and goals in all matters, and to report on its positive and negative experiences; its accomplishments and aspirations; the infrastructure that it has created; its attention to moral, cultural and spiritual matters; the principles and values which inspire its international policy; its thinking in reference to the new international order which the international community is trying to establish; and its position in regard to the problems of international trade. It wishes in this manner to show the world how a developing country is capable of making progress, when its people have the determination to advance it in all respects.\n61.\tThe people and the Government of Guatemala, presided over by Mr. Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia, are continuing to undertake a series of projects aimed at accelerating Guatemala's harmonious and integral development, with respect both to its infrastructure and to meeting its people's cultural and spiritual needs.\n62.\tThose projects are being carried out through the efforts of the Guatemalan people themselves; their conception, design and planning are based on the real needs of the country and the particular character of its people.\n63. Among the public works undertaken, I should like to mention the start of the first stage of the national peripheral highway, a project intended to give our country an extensive network of first-class roads, and the construction of hydroelectric plants, provincial hospitals, schools, low-cost housing, health centers, sports facilities and a modern port on the Pacific Ocean.\n64.\tIn agriculture, a program is under way based on a philosophy of its own. This consists of handing over to agricultural workers, under the system of agricultural collectives, the Government-owned farms and ranches, so that all Guatemalans may have their own land to cultivate, without breaking up the existing agricultural units; this allows for their rational management and exploitation with direct benefits, in particular for those who receive the land.\n65.\tThe program does not stop simply at the distribution of the land. Basic services are provided for the settlers, there is access to loans on favorable conditions, and technical assistance is given to improve production capacity, all of which results in benefits for themselves, their families and the people of Guatemala as a whole.\n66.\tTo date, the Government of Guatemala has already distributed 51,000 land deeds, which have directly benefited over t million Guatemalan citizens.\n67.\tThe attention given to agriculture has had the result that Guatemala, in addition to being an exporter of traditional products, has become a prominent exporter of cotton, cardamom and handicrafts.\n68.\tThe great success of Guatemala's agricultural program has led to those international organizations concerned with agriculture becoming interested in our experience, which they wish to make available ,to other developing nations.\n69.\tIn education, the national literacy plan is successfully under way. This is directed to solving the national educational problem, mainly through eliminating, in the first place, the internal causes of illiteracy by giving increased opportunities for primary education to the population between 7 and 14 years of age, especially in rural areas and urban slums; improving primary schools, reducing the causes of dropping out and repeating grades, and increasing the number of schools teaching the full six grades; providing buildings, furniture, equipment and teaching aids; and training teachers and technical and administrative staff.\n70.\tSecondly, by decreasing illiteracy in the various age groups between 15 and 49 years, through an intensive campaign primarily aimed at the rural population, those working in the building sector and the female population working as domestic servants or as housewives; and by reducing the possibilities of regressive illiteracy through the development of follow-up activities with materials for recently taught readers, together with the development of a network of cultural centers and public libraries and strengthening post-literacy options, in the context of extramural education.\n71.\tThe results of this significant effort may be summarized in the following data. In the semester from January to June 1981, more was accomplished than had been achieved in the previous 30 years.\n72.\tFrom 1945 to 1980, several literacy campaigns were carried out at the national level; of a total of 956,799 adults enrolled, 371,428 became literate that is, 38 per cent.\n73.\tDuring the first semester of the integral literacy campaign in 1981, an enrollment of 467,461 adults was achieved and 327,222 became literate that is, 70 per cent.\n74. UNESCO has already taken note of this development in our literacy campaign.\n75.\tThe follow-up plan in this intensive literacy notion is expected to continue until 1985, encompassing initial literacy, follow-up for new literates and strengthening of the post-literacy mechanisms and the extramural educational options.\n76.\tThis far-reaching national literacy plan is being financed with national resources.\n77.\tThe philosophy underlying the national literacy plan is based on the conviction that the elimination of illiteracy is the road by which every individual can gain access to the heritage of knowledge available to mankind, and by which each society can acquire a command of knowledge which it can put to use in the fulfillmentF of its basic aspirations.\n78.\tThe process of eliminating illiteracy is possible only to the extent to which a coherent initiative is undertaken which integrates the achievement of adult literacy into the general schooling of our youth, within an overall framework of permanent education.\n79.\tAn enterprise of such magnitude as the national literacy plan involves a vigorous mobilization of national energy. In this sense, the people of Guatemala are actively cooperating in its success, and their efforts are all the more praiseworthy in that, having overcome the problems inherent in a program of such wide scope, they have achieved notable results.\n80.\tThis year, our national budget revenues and expenditures amount to 1,200 million quetzales, equivalent to $1,200 million, and 5f per cent of the budget: 664 million quetzales is allocated directly to public investment. In view of the great investment effort which such disbursement requires in an economy such as ours, we have had $211 million in external resources, which indicates that external financing accounts for 17.5 per cent of Guatemala's annual budget.\n81.\tThe energy sector continues to be one of the most important areas of public investment, in an effort to meet the growing energy needs of the productive activities in the country and of projects which contribute to the country's economic and social development.\n82.\tWith reference to hydrocarbons, support continues to be given to oil exploration and exploitation activities.\n83.\tGuatemala's oil production is approximately 6,650 barrels per day. Last year's production reached a volume of somewhat over 1.3 million barrels, of which 539,000 barrels were used for internal consumption and 781,000 were exported.\n84.\tSince Guatemalan oil production is modest, and lower than the requirements to meet its own needs, Guatemala continues to be an oil-importing country; hence it has also been affected economically by the frequent and immoderate rises in the price of that fuel. Therefore, we are preparing to reduce the negative impact of this phenomenon by construction of the Chulac, Chixoy and Aguacapa hydroelectric projects. \n85.\tThe Chulac project will have an installed capacity of 440 megawatts which will enable us to reduce our dependence on oil, since it will add 1,742 million kilowatts of energy to the rational electricity system, replacing 4,100,000 barrels of oil annually. The total cost of this hydroelectric complex, which is to begin operations in January 1988, will be $900 million.\n86.\tThe Aguacapa hydroelectric plant will have an installed capacity of 9C megawatts, with an annual production of 390 million kilowatts, which will replace 930,000 barrels oiXgjl^a year. The total cost of this hydroelectric plant is $170 million, and it will begin operations this month.\n87.\tThe Chixoy hydroelectric plant will have an installed capacity of 300 megawatts, with a total annual production of 1,590 kilowatts, enabling us each year to save 3,780,000 barrels of oil. The cost of this project, which is scheduled to begin operations in June 1982, is $630 million.\n88.\tA hydroelectric study of the Usumacinta River was begun during the last third of 1980, in conjunction and co ordination with similar studies of that river being carried out by the Mexican Government, in order to determine the desirability of bilateral use of its waters to generate electric power.\n89.\tAlso, for the same purpose of solving the problem of our dependence on foreign supplies of hydrocarbons, we are promoting the development of geothermal projects and special attention is being given to the search for alternatives to conventional energy sources that is, to new and renewable sources.\n90.\tThroughout the world there are large quantities of organic waste, both animal and vegetable. Since 1952, research work has been done in Guatemala on the anaerobic fermentation process to produce gas fuel -biogas-  and high-quality organic fertilizer.\n91.\tThe Latin American Energy Organization [OLADE] has recognized that Guatemala is a pioneer in the development of biogas in America, and our progress has been favorably compared with and is perhaps superior to that achieved by countries with more experience.\n92.\tGuatemalan technicians are also participating in the development of an anaerobic system in the United States. In 198C, OLADE used the Guatemalan system, making it available to all the countries in the region. In 1981, the largest biogas plant in existence in Latin America started operations in Guatemala.\n93.\tThus Guatemala is making great efforts to reduce its dependence on foreign fuels, not only through the construction of large hydroelectric complexes, but also by utilizing its own natural resources and applying technology suited to our environment to make use of the new and renewable energy sources with which we have been endowed by nature.\n94.\tMy country places all of this experience at the service of mankind.\n95.\tSports, which in Guatemala operate with complete autonomy, continues to receive all possible aid from the Government of the Republic, so that our Guatemalan youth may derive physical and spiritual benefits from sports activities, thus contributing to the growth of our country.\n96.\tDuring the 30year period from 1949 to 1979, sports received Government assistance to the tune of 5 million quetzales and it is estimated that during the period from 1979 to 2009 sports will receive 300 million quetzales in aid, which shows the importance that Guatemala attaches to the training of youth in sports in general.\n97.\tWith respect to the housing sector; the national plan on the subject is being implemented. It contains goals as regards instruments and concrete objectives with an investment of approximately 56 million quetzales earmarked for the execution of programs of housing development and construction, in order to meet the needs of the population, especially the low-income sector.\n98.\tGovernment banking institutions dealing with housing have granted loans on favorable terms to a large number of. Guatemalans.\n99.\tThe direction and execution of Guatemala's external policy rest on the postulates which are the greatest aspirations of mankind, such as peace, universal wellbeing, international social justice, freedom, respect for the dignity of nations and their territorial integrity and the promotion of cooperation among nations, as objectives for the purpose of providing present and future generation? with a better world that will make possible the full material, moral and spiritual fulfillment of all human beings.\n100.\tWithin this context, Guatemala's international policy is totally in keeping with its national policy since internally we aspire to attain the same noble objectives. Consequently, Guatemala's international policy is profoundly nationalistic, essentially democratic, fraternally Central American, absolutely sovereign, firmly based on solidarity in the regional sphere, comprehensive and realistic in the face of the crucial problems confronting mankind and based on active participation in the search for the most adequate solutions to those problems. The characteristics of our international policy are honesty, sovereignty, consistency, respect, conciliation, dignity and pragmatism.\n101.\tIt is by applying such principles and these characteristics of Guatemalan international policy that we support the position of the Republic of Korea. We believe that the Korean question should be left to the Koreans themselves, who should find an independent and peaceful solution thereto, and also that the United Nations could contribute to creating a propitious climate for the renewal of interKorean talks, that is direct negotiations between the two Korean parties.\n102.\tGuatemala believes that the new international order will not become a reality unless it is based on international social justice. The fundamentals of the new international order, of which the economic aspect is but a part, express a well-intentioned concept of the objectives to be achieved, but which so far have remained mere aspirations.\n103.\tIn our opinion, the establishment of a new international order should take into account not only political and economic factors but also social and cultural problems, since the injustices of the present international system are not limited to economic relations, international trade or monetary problems but also involve living , conditions, health and education, as well as cultural and spiritual needs.\n104.\tThe concept of the new order should be made deeper and broader. The order of which we are speaking should be much more than a type of organization of international relations or a juridical order based on the recognition of rights and obligations.\n105.\tIn order that the foundations of a new international order may be established, agreement should first be reached with regard to a system of values and there should be acceptance of a joint examination of these, that is, of the scope of values such as justice, freedom, equality and solidarity.\n106.\tThose values should be approached on a twofold basis: on the one hand from the angle of recognition of the interdependence of the world in terms of the diversity of its peoples, races and cultures, and on the other from the angle of the affirmation of the will for peaceful coexistence, felt not only as a necessity but as a destiny to be forged for all and as a responsibility to the future of the human species.\n107.\tIt is not possible, therefore, to uphold the idea that underdevelopment is a mere retardation that can be overcome by means of a linear recuperation process in the context of the world economy, since the establishment of a new international order consists precisely in the adoption of a set of measures that will permit the advent of effective international cooperation.\n108.\tHence it is necessary for the countries themselves to choose ways and means of development according to their own creative capabilities and in conformity with the values that are inherent in them, reaffirming their own identity and thus contributing to the effective establishment of relations of equality among nations that are fully responsible for their own destiny.\n109.\tThe new international order should lead to a new human order based on freedom, justice and equity, on the elimination of inequality among countries, on mutual understanding, on cooperation in the great tasks that are common to mankind and on the participation of all in wellbeing, education, knowledge and culture.\n110.\tThe establishment of a new international order demands the creation of relationships based on the principle of the juridical equality of States. A country's consciousness of its own identity is one of the factors that strengthens most its position in international dialog. Ear from being an isolating factor, the affirmation of its idiosyncrasy is, on the contrary, the very basis for participation in exchanges in which each country's full rights are recognized.\n111.\tGuatemala believes that any reform in the structure of international trade must be based on the fundamental premise that the present trade mechanisms are defective and distorted. Such mechanisms make it impossible for the developing countries to obtain a fair price for their exports. Furthermore, they tend to maintain unchanged the difficulties of access to markets in industrialized countries. Then our basic products become subject to cyclic fluctuations, which jeopardize not only adequate remuneration for. agricultural activities but also the international liquidity of our economy.\ni \u00bb\n112.\tEconomic relations and the general standards that should govern world trade, especially in the field of raw materials, trade in manufactured goods, the transfer of technology and cooperation in the financial and monetary sectors, require a thorough revision in order to adapt them gradually to the realities of the present day world while bringing about the new international order.\n113.\tAn important condition of the improvement of the prospects of developing countries is the restoration of a more stable and dynamic and less inflationary growth in developed countries with market economies. Consequently, anti-inflationary efforts should be combined with policies whose objective is to restore growth while increasing employment and productivity.\n114.\tThat growth, reinforced by less protectionist policies, would broaden the markets for exports from developing countries, facilitate the process of international structural economic adjustment, and promote an increase in the transfer of capital in concessionary terms.\n115.\tWhat the underdeveloped countries claim in the international economic forum, in order to have a better balanced and just international trade, may be summarized in the following aspirations: remunerative prices for our exports; guarantee of access for our exports to the markets of the industrialized countries; removal of tariff and non tariff barriers, as well as protectionist measures; and prevention of the constant increase in prices of the products we import in order to halt deterioration of the terms of trade.\n116.\tGuatemala reiterates once again its protest before the international community of the action by the United Kingdom in unilaterally granting independence to Belize and its absolute rejection of that action, by which the United Kingdom is attempting to evade its obligations as a party in a controversy subject to the processes of peaceful solution proclaimed by the Charter of the United Nations.\n117.\tThe origins of the dispute are well known. With the achievement of independence by Guatemala in 1821, the territories between the rivers Hondo, Nuevo, Belize and Sibun, that Spain had ceded to Great Britain in 1783 and 1786 for the sole purpose of exploiting their lumber resources, under prohibition not to erect any type of fortification or to create permanent facilities of any kind came under the sovereignty of Guatemala.\n118.\tThe weakness of Guatemala as a new State was taken advantage of by Great Britain which consolidated its dominion over the region it had only in usufruct  limited to less than 6,000 square kilometers and extended it by force towards the south in Guatemalan territory between the Sibun and Sarstoon rivers an extension of more than 15,000 km2 expelling Guatemalan dwellers and preventing by force the exercise of sovereignty over the territory, to which Guatemala was entitled on the day of its independence from Spain on 15 September 1821. To validate this illegal possession, Great Britain coerced Guatemala into subscribing to a treaty in 1859, the so-called \\\"limits Treaty\\\", and disguised a territorial concession in exchange for benefits and compensations which never materialized. Ever since, Guatemala has been claiming the return of the usurped territory.\n119.\tIt is worth while recalling the background to the dispute so that it will at no time be believed that Guatemala is abusing Belizean weakness in trying to recover a territory which is rightfully Guatemalan. The controversy with the United Kingdom has not been settled, but on this territory under dispute they have tried in vain to establish a new State; acceptance by the United Nations, in violation of its Charter, of a unilateral declaration of independence for Belize does not change the original situation relating to the territory and does not solve the dispute on the claimed territory, which belongs to Guatemala and never belonged to the United Kingdom.\n120.\tGuatemala has widely and undeniably demonstrated its vocation for peace and its respect for the institutions of international law. The dispute was subject to direct negotiations between the parties and, as a result, on 11 March this year in London we subscribed to the Heads of Agreement, the clear text of which, without ambiguities, as was unanimously agreed, would lead to the final solution of the controversy. We also agreed that such a final solution was desirable in order to stabilize relations of every kind in the northern region of Central America, and also permanently to protect international peace and security. However, when we tried to bring up to the level of a treaty what had been agreed to in the Heads of Agreement, we found distorted interpretations, changes of attitude and a wish to minimize and transform the clear text of the Heads of Agreement, arguing and this is something unbelievable in relations between States that the Heads of Agreement could not be met strictly, and that their literal application was not acceptable, but rather that it was necessary to renegotiate, reinterpret and, surprisingly, to make a radical modification in the treaties.\n121.\tThis change of attitude, this disregard for the pledge given, was never explained or justified. It was barely hinted that, the local government of Belize having offered to submit any covenant to a referendum, this must be avoided because the Government would probably be rejected in their proposals and might lose power.\n122.\tThe United Kingdom has also said at this General Assembly that, the present local government of Belize having been reelected through almost two decades, and one of the points in their platform being independence, it should be inferred that there had been a sufficient act of self-determination by the people of Belize. Undoubtedly, this has been a contrivance, as many others by the United Kingdom, cunning and with the appearance of truth, but it is a total fallacy. The people of Belize have not been summoned formally to determine freely, as would be proper* their own future, and the people of Belize, or most of them, have never been in agreement with this independence imposed upon them to satisfy the designs of the United Kingdom to avoid its responsibilities in this dispute.\n123.\tThus, it is clear that it cannot be said, by any stretch of the imagination, that there has been in Belize an act of self-determination with due consultation of the people. What occurred is merely a skillful use of words by the United Kingdom, which gave the name of self-determination to local elections determining questions of immediate concern, and where there was no statement whatsoever about the independence of Belize.\n124.\tThe United Nations, which was created, and in particular the Security Council, to maintain international peace and security and to promote the peaceful solution of disputes among States by means of the different mechanisms laid down in its own Charter, has failed in its mission, and has been used as an instrument by a powerful nation in order to commit an act of international injustice against a small country, which was one of the founders of the Organization and which has always abided by its principles and acted within the principles of international ethics and morality.\n125.\tGuatemala solemnly reiterates that the independence of Belize is unlawful, that it does not recognize such a State, which does not have as its borders the lines maintained by the British occupation forces. Nor does Guatemala recognize it as an integral part of Central America or as a member of the United Nations, nor will Guatemala recognize its sovereignty or territorial integrity, as long as the dispute between Guatemala and the United Kingdom in relation to the territory of Belize is not solved through the peaceful means established in the Charter of the United Nations.\n126.\tFor Guatemala, the lines maintained at the present time by British military forces, or in the future by any unforeseeable combination of forces, are not borderlines. The territorial controversy continues unresolved. This unilateral independence is totally irrelevant to the usurpation and plundering suffered by Guatemala and therefore is despicable and fallacious. We will maintain peace, but our claims and our search for justice continue, now emphasized by this new British mockery.\n127.\tIn view of the foregoing, we now state and categorically reiterate the broadest and most express reservation of all rights by the Republic of Guatemala over the territory of Belize. There has been no action whatsoever capable of changing the statement contained in our Constitution, since the only holder of sovereignty qver that territory is the people of Guatemala.\n128.\tGuatemala, as I have said, firmly maintains as a basis of its foreign policy an attitude of brotherliness with regard to Central America and everything affecting it. Historically, the five countries of the Isthmus have kept bonds and links that have been such as to make us all partners in the same destiny, so that whatever occurs in one of the sister nations has immediate repercussions on the other four.\n129.\tThese singular relationships of affective interests do not rest solely upon memories of our common past; they answer to geographical realities and similarities of need in the light of the imperatives of development. The idea lives, then, not merely in words in some constitutional document, but it has been transformed into a field of action of our economic growth. Prosperity and development in one of the five Central American nations cannot be conceived of without some degree of development and prosperity in the others. Equally, there cannot be depression and suffering in one of the five countries that in some degree will not affect the other four.\n130.\tOne of the highest expressions of a common ideal in Central America has always been our rejection of foreign interference. Central American life is full of the scars left on our peoples at the hands of strangers. In the seventeenth century, they were English, French and Dutch pirates and buccaneers. In the eighteenth century, they were British sailors and corsairs of different nationalities.\nIn the nineteenth century, they were North American freebooters. In the early years of this century, it was the shadow of the Monroe Doctrine that, in creating a monopoly in Central American intervention, was also given expression by the presence of Marines. Today, new wounds are being suggested for Central America as a result of the rivalry of forces alien to the Isthmus. Our historical experience is that there are no benign interventions, for they all pervert and, when trying to help, they strike and destroy. From that same experience we know that if transitory there are local forces that sympathize with an intervention, they soon show themselves for what they truly are: ephemeral and inconsequential in the national destiny of Central America.\n131.\tIf it seems that the ideal of Central American fraternity has disappeared in some areas, we well know that in one way or another it will not be long in reappearing, and with new drive. The crucible of the struggle of our peoples to overcome their disadvantages and to improve their standards of living forges new men who will be the bearers of the Central American ideal.\n132.\tAt the present time, the Central American ideal takes second place in the presence of the emergencies and needs that gave rise to the terrible and extended violence in Central America. Much of the struggle would cease if it were not encouraged, supported and equipped from outside. Mistaken feelings of solidarity and sympathy lead to meddling and threaten to turn our countries into testing grounds for weapons and ideologies. The cessation of all intervention in the five countries of Central America would not end that violence altogether but it would give the peoples of Central America an opportunity to defend their national values and bring them to fulfillment and to achieve a just peace in keeping with our spiritual, social, political and economic needs.\n133.\tGuatemala has faith in mankind, in the values that represent its greatest aspirations and in the international community as represented by this Organization, which in order to meet it goals and objectives should endeavor to ensure that all Member States act with the same sincerity and wholeheartedness as that with which my country acts my country which, as a founding Member of the United Nations, has always made its juridical and political contribution towards fulfillment of the principles and purposes of the Charter.\n134.\tThe people of Guatemala is noble, dignified, honest and hardworking, mature in civic matters, determined to maintain its values untouched and its democratic way of life, a people proud of its MayaQuiche ancestry, a people which bases its life on freedom, justice and equality of opportunity for all, conscious of the difficulties it must overcome to advance in its development process and optimistic about its destiny and its future.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to extend to Mr. Kittani of Iraq, on behalf of my delegation, our sincere congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the thirty- sixth session of the General Assembly. The Sudan, which enjoys close brotherly relations with his country, is confident that his wealth of experience, wisdom and competence in the political and diplomatic fields will enable him to guide the deliberations of this session towards success and towards the constructive goals to which we all aspire.\n235.\tMy delegation would also like to express appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, for the competence and skill with which he discharged his responsibilities as President of the thirty-fifth session and the emergency special session on Namibia. We also appreciate his tireless efforts to create a favorable climate in which the Assembly can achieve progress towards launching global negotiations on the most important international economic questions.\n236.\tMy delegation warmly welcomes the admission of Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu to the United Nations. We trust that they will make a useful and effective contribution to the work of the Organization.\n237.\tThe General Assembly is convening at a time when the international situation is fraught with tension, conflict, deterioration of international relations and mutual mistrust between nations that seriously threaten international peace and security. This gloomy situation is a serious challenge to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. The policy of intervention in the internal affairs of others and the recurrent resort to the use of force in international relations, precipitating armed conflicts in various parts of the world, reflect a. disturbing contradiction between the commitments of Member States under the Charter and their actions and behavior which constitute blatant violations of the Charter and a challenge to the Organization in which the people of the world place all their hopes. There is a great divide between the commitment to the principles and provisions of the Charter and the actual conduct of States in their international relations. Therefore, to put an end to this dangerous situation, responsible and serious international action is imperative. Only through political will and objective cooperation on the part of the international community today and not tomorrow can we create a sound international community based on equality, justice and interdependence for the good of humanity as a whole.\n238.\tOn several occasions we and others have drawn attention to an extremely dangerous phenomenon in international relations that is, interference in the internal affairs of other States, which has spread and become recurrent in the last few years. We reject and condemn interference in the internal affairs of other States, regardless of the cause or pretext, not only because it is a contravention of the principles governing international relations or because it threatens the peace, security and development of the States concerned, but also because it threatens the peace and security of whole regions, forcing many States and peoples, particularly the poorest ones, to use their limited resources for defense rather than for the economic and social development so necessary and urgent for their peoples. Therefore the Sudan will always firmly reject and condemn this dangerous trend in international relations and ask that it be ended before it is too late to avoid catastrophe.\n239.\tThe States of the Organization in general and those of the third world in particular must realize that any compromise about or condoning of interference in the affairs of others is in fact the negation of all the victories that peoples have won during a long and arduous struggle against all forms of colonialism, oppression and repression.\n240.\tThe principles of respect for the national independence, sovereignty and unity of all States and for the right of all peoples to freedom and self-determination become meaningless if any State, acting alone or abetted by others, is allowed to impose its own system or ideology on other weaker or poorer States and peoples. That is why the Sudan is firmly convinced that these fundamental principles constitute the very basis for present day international relations and should be respected by all States in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, which safeguards the sovereignty and independence of all States, in particular the small and the weak,\n241.\tThe Sudan believes strongly in the principles of settlement of disputes by peaceful means and of the inadmissibility of the use of force in international relations, in accordance with international law and international instruments, particularly the Charter of the United Nations. Our commitment to these principles is reflected in our attempts to assist in finding peaceful solutions to conflicts in both the African and the Arab regions through dialog and mediation, thus maintaining brotherly relations and good-neighborliness and consolidating cooperation in the efforts to achieve development and prosperity.\n242.\tThe Sudan's initiatives and untiring efforts, led by our President himself, to settle by peaceful means the dispute in the Horn of Africa through negotiations and dialog stem from this firm conviction, because the political solution is the only lasting one. The economic and social situation, the historical background and the strategic importance of the region make concerted and sincere action by its countries and peoples essential, in order to allow brotherly coexistence and cooperation among them, so as to channel all their resources towards the solution of the urgent problems of economic and social development, of the refugees and of the damage resulting from the droughts which have affected the country for several years now. Wisdom, rationality and mutual interest make it necessary for the peoples and States of the region to settle their disputes and use their wealth and resources for the true benefit of the peoples and to avoid being drawn into superPower conflicts, which usually involve foreign intervention and undermine national independence and sovereignty.\n243.\tThe Sudan is equally concerned by the situation in Chad and has actively contributed to the attempts to find an equitable, political and just settlement that would safeguard the national unity and territorial integrity of Chad and the peace, security and stability of- the whole region. We fervently hope that the resolutions of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Nairobi, will be fully implemented.\n244.\tThe Sudan also feels considerable concern over the question of Western Sahara. That was why we participated actively in the African Committee of Wise Men set up by the OAU Assembly to find a peaceful solution to this problem. We note with satisfaction and pride that the Committee, with the assistance and cooperation of all the parties concerned, was able to agree on a practical and just base for settling the problem. We are proud of the fact that all parties to the dispute expressed their readiness to accept and apply the decisions and recommendations of the Committee. The Sudan considers that this African problem should be solved under the aegis of the OAU,\n245.\tIn the international sphere, our commitment to the principles of the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means prompted our repeated appeals for just political settlements that would end the war that has been going on for more than a year now between two brother countries, Iraq and Iran; for a peaceful solution to the question of Afghanistan, ending the foreign intervention there and enabling the Afghan people to enjoy its right to freedom, independence, sovereignty and nonalignment; for the peaceful reunification of Korea in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of its people; and for the solution of the problem of Cyprus in such a way as to safeguard that country's independence, unity and territorial integrity,\n246.\tThe Sudan's commitment to the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means is also reflected in our active participation in the International Conference on Kampuchea, which took place in July, and in our acceptance of membership of the Ad Hoc Committee of that Conference entrusted with the task of creating a climate favorable to the attainment of a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the Kampuchean question. We take this opportunity of expressing to the international community our gratitude for having been chosen as a member of the Committee, and we pledge ourselves to exert every effort to ensure that the Committee fulfills its responsibility for finding a peaceful solution to the Kampuchean problem.\n247.\tThe Sudan's calls for the avoidance of conflict and the settlement of disputes through dialog in order to establish the peace and stability necessary for the achievement of progress and prosperity and the safeguarding of the human heritage cannot be dissociated from the disturbing phenomenon of the escalating arms race in the world. This frightening race is occurring not only between the great Powers but also between poor developing countries, which would do better to channel their limited human and natural resources into development and construction and the alleviation of the poverty, hunger, ignorance, disease and underdevelopment.\n248.\tIt is sad, regrettable and, at the same time, frightening to note that the expenditure on weapons capable of destroying the world ten times over has reached an astronomical figure exceeding $500 billion, in a world plagued by serious economic crises that undermine its foundations and threaten its very survival. It is imperative that we seriously search for a practical, speedy solution to end the arms race,\n249.\tAt this stage there is no need to stress here the fundamental importance the international community attaches to the situation in the Middle East. It is a situation that, in the absence of a just settlement to the problem of Palestine, continues to endanger international peace and security and to aggravate the conflict in the region. The recent developments we have witnessed this year have given a new and serious dimension to the Middle East crisis. The international community must pause and contemplate what might arise if no appropriate and timely measures are taken.\n250.\tThis year has witnessed the unprecedented and wanton Israeli aggression against Iraq and the destruction of the Iraqi peaceful nuclear installations which were properly subjected to international inspection and control, in accordance with the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Israel has refused to accede. This Israeli criminal act, in addition to its violation of international norms and instruments calling for respect for the territorial integrity of States and of the principles upon which IAEA was founded, constitutes an obvious denial of the right of the peoples and States of the region to develop their resources and wealth in order to achieve progress and prosperity, The flagrant Israeli aggression against Iraq has confirmed what we have been reiterating for several years with regard to Israel's limitless ambitions for occupation, expansion and hegemony. Under the pretext of ensuring its security, Israel invented an imaginary Arab threat in order to obtain the aid and support necessary for achieving its illegitimate dreams and objectives.\n251.\tIsrael did not stop with the bombing of the Iraqi nuclear research center, which it reached by violating the territorial integrity of Iraq and several neighboring countries. It also waged wanton aggression against Lebanon, destroying houses, schools, places of worship, roads and civilian refugee camps in an attempt to carry out its criminal plan to exterminate the Palestinian people wherever they are.\n252.\tThose serious developments and the inhuman practices of the Zionist regime in Jerusalem and all the occupied Arab territories are proof that no just and durable peace can be established in the area so long as Israel continues to plan for aggression and expansion and so long as the international community's response is confined to mere denunciations and condemnations.\n253.\tLet us ask and we have every right to ask how long will such an odd and bizarre situation prevail in the Middle East? For how much longer are the Palestinian people condemned to remain confined to refugee camps despite the resolutions of this Organization and others reaffirming their legitimate national and human rights, including their right to self-determination and to establish an independent sovereign State in Palestine? Do we still need to repeat every year from this same rostrum that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is still dependent upon the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since June 1967, including Jerusalem? Do we need to dwell on the fact that a comprehensive and just peace in the area is still contingent upon Israel's full compliance with the United Nations resolutions that condemn the acquisition of territories by force and aggression? Do we need still more affirmations that a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the area cannot be achieved without the participation of the PLO?\n254.\tThe deteriorating situation in the Middle East is the most serious challenge to the international community and to the ability of the United Nations to realize the lofty principles and objectives upon which it is based. Ranking high among those principles are respect for the inalienable rights of all peoples to life, freedom and self determination, as well as the inadmissibility of aggression, expansion and acquisition of territory by force. The Israeli contempt for those principles and its noncompliance with the resolutions and provisions adopted by the\nOrganization confront us all with a grave international responsibility. The deliberate Israeli violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law has left the international community with no choice but that of applying the measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter against Israel.\n255.\tThe deteriorating situation in southern Africa also requires urgent consideration by the international community. In that region, barbaric policies and practices are carried out by another racist regime in violation of international law and instruments and United Nations resolutions. The white minority regime of South Africa is a mirror image and a natural ally of the Zionist Government of Israel, as is evidenced by the similarity of their aggressive, expansionist practices and by the close cooperation between these two abnormal regimes outlawed by the international community.\n256.\tIn Namibia, where the situation poses a serious threat to world peace and security and where the international community has recognized the necessity of peacefully settling the question in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), South Africa is still trying to undermine the international efforts in order to maintain its domination and exploitation of the wealth of Namibia.\n257.\tSouth Africa participated in the arduous and protracted negotiations that led to resolution 435 (1978) and has pledged to implement it. It is also aware of the tolerance and wisdom demonstrated by SWAPO and all the African countries in accepting this compromise and pledging to implement it fully in order to arrive at a peaceful settlement of the Namibian question.\n258.\tIt is evident that South Africa will change neither its position nor its policies in Namibia unless the international community particularly the Western countries  takes a firm stand with regard to South Africa along the lines prescribed in resolution ES8/2, adopted at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, on Namibia, held early last month. All States are called upon to implement the sanctions against South Africa in order to force it to respect the international will and to abide by United Nations resolutions.\n259.\tWe appeal to all Member States, regardless of their social systems, to show the utmost cooperation in observing and enforcing these comprehensive sanctions in order completely to isolate the racist regime in South Africa. The five Western countries that played a significant role in bringing about the plan contained in resolution 435 (1978) are under a greater obligation than others to exert pressure on South Africa to force it to implement that Security Council resolution, thus peacefully settling the Namibian question before the situation explodes and threatens everyone's interests in that vital area. We appreciate the efforts of the five Western countries to find a peaceful and just settlement to the Namibian question, and we trust that they will continue those efforts whatever the obstacles and the difficulties involved.\n260.\tThe people and the Government of the Sudan have followed with great concern and attention the deteriorating situation in South Africa, which is caused by the intensified repressive measures of the racist regime against the indigenous majority of the people and by that regime's persistence in implementing the policies and practices of apartheid, which have been rejected and condemned by the international community. The Sudan and all of Africa have repeatedly warned here and in other international forums of the dangers inherent in South Africa's racist policies, particularly what the South African Government calls the policy of \\\"separate development of the races\\\" and what the rest of the world calls \\\"apartheid\\\". There is also the policy of \\\"gradual change\\\", a term by which the racist minority regime in Pretoria is trying to trick the international community into thinking that gradual improvement of their inhuman regime is in progress in South Africa.\n^ol. Our rejection of that whole policy emanates from our awareness of the real intentions of the racist minority in South Africa and our conviction that its racist policies and measures are nothing more than mere tinkering that does not affect the basic structure of the hideous apartheid regime, which on the one hand guarantees the perpetuation of the domination and exploitation by the white minority and on the other ensures that the majority of the indigenous black majority will continue to live as poor oppressed foreigners in their own homeland.\n262.\tWe warn of the dangerous consequences of applauding and Relieving the present and future tricks that Pretoria pulls out in order to placate world opinion and suppress the struggle of our brothers in South Africa for liberty and equality. What Pretoria should do is not effect limited and superficial changes, but uproot and completely destroy the apartheid system and establish a healthy democratic society in which the majority will exercise its natural and legitimate right to liberty and sovereignty in its own homeland.\n263.\tWe believe that this is inevitable, because the heroic struggle and resistance of the black majority is being intensified despite the repressive policies and the new oppressive practices which the racist regime continually invents. However, it is sad and frustrating to note the silence of many countries as they witness the policy of deportation and dispersion practiced by the racist authorities which consists of removing people to the areas known as Bantustans. Such policy has been rejected and declared null and void by the international community.\n264.\tThese serious developments in southern Africa and the threat they pose to peace and security not only in Africa but also in the whole world make more clear than ever the necessity for the international community represented in the Assembly not only to condemn and declare invalid and illegal all those measures of the racist authorities but also to start applying against South Africa the comprehensive sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n265.\tThe international economic situation is, unfortunately, in no better shape than the political situation. In the last few years, and particularly this year, we have witnessed an intensified aggravation of the world economic situation, the serious repercussions of which on the developing countries threaten to undermine not only the development efforts of these countries but also their ability to provide their peoples with the barest necessities.\n266.\tThe adoption of the new International Development Strategy for the 1980s by the Assembly at its thirty-fifth session [resolution 35/56] has revived hopes for improved international economic cooperation that would accelerate the development of the developing countries within the context of the establishment of the new international economic order. However, the setbacks affecting international economic cooperation in the course of this year as reflected in the failures and disappointments in the preparations for the global negotiations, the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the system for financing scientific and technical cooperation for development and other areas have proved that no meaningful change has occurred since last year and that the rigid and intransigent positions of some developed countries, which led to the failure of the eleventh special session last year, have only hardened this year.\n267.\tThe reluctance of a few developed countries to participate positively in the search for solutions to the present economic crisis and especially the chronic problems of the developing countries is a serious element threatening not only to stall the dialog on more rational and fruitful international economic cooperation, but also to destroy the still fragile basis which the international community has managed to establish, within the United Nations framework, as a starting-point in its endeavors to achieve an economically interdependent world based on cooperation for the benefit of all rather than on confrontation and narrow national interests, the bitter results of which the world experienced in the 1930s. The situation is further worsened by the world economic crisis and its impact on the economies of developing countries, as the developed countries have resorted to shortsighted national policies, protectionist measures, inflationary policies, high interest rates, cuts in official development assistance to developing countries, the creation of tariff and non-tariff barriers against goods from developing countries and the restriction of the transfer of technology of those countries.\n268.\tOne of the most important recent events in the economic field was the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which took place in Paris during the first half of September. We believe that the convening of the Conference was in itself international recognition of the serious economic situation in some 30 developing countries that are faced with special structural problems threatening their very survival in the present international economic situation. It was also an expression of the desire of the international community to find quickly fruitful solutions to these problems, a desire manifested in the development and adoption by the Conference of the Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the least developed countries.6 Although the outcome of the Conference fell short of the demands and expectations of the developing countries, and the least developed in particular, the adoption of the program of Action and the commitment to implement it constitute a serious step towards the radical solution of the problems of the least developed countries in a manner that will enable them to achieve self-sustained economic and social development. The commitment of most of the developed countries to designate 0.7 per cent of their revenue for official development assistance, and the commitment of many of them to allocate 0.15 per cent of their revenue to the least developed countries in order to double that pub lie assistance by 1985, are serious and encouraging indications of the prospects of implementing the Substantial New program of Action adopted in Paris.\n269.\tThe least developed countries, and indeed the other developing countries, are confronted not only with the serious problems posed by the international economic crisis, particularly food and energy problems, but also with other serious problems, such as national disasters and the influx of refugees that strain their already weak economies, drain their meagre resources and divert the efforts that are supposed to be directed towards economic and social development.\n270.\tThe Sudan, one of the African least developed countries which is host to large numbers of refugees, accords a special importance to the problems of refugees in the world in general and in Africa in particular. We are concerned not only because of the humanitarian aspects of the refugee problem but also, because of their serious impact on the economic and social development plans of the host countries and countries of origin. That is why we welcomed the convening of the International Convention on Assistance to Refugees in Africa, which was held at Geneva in April on an African initiative and with international support.\n271.\tWe are gratified that the Conference succeeded in highlighting the plight of refugees in Africa and in indicating the nature and magnitude of the assistance urgently needed by the refugees and the host countries. The active participation in that Conference was a clear indication of the international community's concern and support for African refugees. Although the pledged contributions fell short of the need of refugees in Africa, we believe that the Conference was a step in the right direction which ought to be followed by international measures and pledges commensurate with the magnitude of the problems at a time when new waves of refugees further strain the economies of the host countries.\n272.\tWe appeal to all States, institutions, organizations and individuals that pledged contributions at or outside the Geneva Conference to make their contributions available without delay, because the refugee situation is critical and the needs are pressing. The refugee settlement projects which were presented to the Conference by several African countries, in particular the Sudan, are well prepared and, as such, should be financed by the resources pledged at the Conference. Most of those projects, including that of the Sudan, aim at providing regular settlements for the refugees, making them self-reliant and integrating them in national and economic and social development programs,\n273.\tIn conclusion, I should like to reiterate that, in spite of the tensions in international relations today and the gap between international behavior as prescribed by the Charter and as practised by States, we still hope that wisdom will prevail and that all States will uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter as providing the best framework for regulating relations among States and establishing cooperation on civilized and rational bases. The political, military and economic crises besetting the world today should not be a cause for undue pessimism, but should spur us to exert more efforts to create an international community based on peace and justice.\n274.\tThe people and Government of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan would like to reaffirm here their commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and pledge that they will work tirelessly in order to consolidate those principles in a way that will ensure the achievement of peace and prosperity for all nations.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t: It is with deep pleasure that we see in the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly a high representative of the Republic of Iraq, a country with which we have close ties of friendship and cooperation. The election of a distinguished diplomat, one who represents a country which belongs to the nonaligned movement a country which supports the cause of liberty, self-determination and the independence of peoples and countries constitutes an honor to the Assembly. My delegation will give you, Mr. President, its full support and cooperation in an effort to see our work fully successful.\n2.\tWe also want to compliment the Secretary-General on his relentless efforts and dedication in the search for the best solutions to the international problems and conflicts that plague all humanity.\n3.\tIt is with satisfaction that we salute the admission of Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu as Members of the United Nations. This growth of our big family of nations, based upon the just desire of peoples for independence, liberty and justice, is nothing but the consecration of the dignified principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. The implementation of these principles should be irreversible. All those peoples that remain victims of domination and exploitation by others should occupy the place which is rightfully theirs in the Assembly.\n4.\tIt is with deep concern that we see the alarming deterioration of the international situation in the political field, as well as in the economic field. The crisis in the international economic system is still causing a great disarrangement of structures and a persistent lack of equity in international economic relations.\n5.\tIn spite of the measures established by the Declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [General Assembly resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)], the results that we see coming out of the multilateral economic negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order are still modest. The transformation of declarations of intent into positive action depends basically upon the political good will of the developed countries towards effective and firm steps that will contribute to the establishment of a new system of international economic relations.\n6.\tAdequate, lasting solutions to the problems which face the world economy require a global and integrated approach to such relevant questions as those of raw materials, trade, food, energy, money and finance. It is therefore necessary that the global round of negotiations be launched immediately.\n7.\tThe successful outcome of the global negotiations, through the adoption of collective accords on the various questions, will result in a significant contribution to the implementation of the Third United Nations Development Decade. Their failure, on the other hand, could bring about even worse consequences for development and international cooperation and for international peace and security.\n8.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique maintains that the intensification of cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and complementarity constitutes an important factor towards the acceleration of the development of our countries. We reaffirm our total commitment to the principles of collective self-reliance as a fundamental element of international cooperation.\n9.\tWe are pleased with the results achieved at the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held at Caracas, through the adoption of the program of Action [see Al36/333 and Corr. /], in which mechanisms are defined that will safely ensure the monitoring, follow-up and evaluation of the actions provided in the program.\n10.\tThe dimension and gravity of the problems that are the concern of the Assembly require reflection in order to identify the causes that are at their origin.\n11.\tThe end of the decade of the 1970s was characterized by the growing struggles of peoples for emancipation, self-determination and independence and for the recovery and proper use of their natural resources. The idea of the total emancipation of all peoples is one that does not interest imperialism, since equality is not compatible with the criminal kind of domination and exploitation on which it feeds.\nA/36/PV.22\n12.\tThe decade of the 1980s has begun under the sign of a general worsening of the tension that exists in several regions of the world. The process of detente, which was \nan answer to the anxieties of humanity, no longer represents the main trend in international relations. dialog and mutual understanding for the solution of our problems have been replaced by a return to the climate of cold war. In a world where the only criterion used for relations with the developing countries is apparently the EastWest dichotomy, the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are regarded as dead issues.\n13.\tUsing the \\\"Communist occupation\\\" as a scarecrow, imperialism denies to peoples and States the right of free choice with regard to their political, economic and social systems, as well as free exercise of permanent sovereignty over their own natural resources. The destabilization of democratic and popular regimes by means of economic blockade, the infiltration of agents, the use of mercenaries and the ever shameful recourse to direct and open armed aggression is today a common practice.\n14.\tOn the other hand, the unpopular racist, Zionist, Fascist and colonialist regimes, basing themselves on the same cold war logic, see the aggression they perpetrate against their own peoples suddenly approved and supported. Most of the time, imperialism entrusts these regimes with the task of acting as police States with regard to their own neighbors. This type of action results in provocations, aggressions and massacres. Such is the case with South Africa; such is the case with Israel. This is the sad reality that we also see in Latin America. Asia and Oceania.\n15.\tWe have not yet dispelled from our memories the ashes and debris of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and once more humanity is being threatened. The decision by the Government of the United States of America to manufacture the neutron bomb is a threat that hangs over all our heads. In spite of the strong condemnation with which the international community has greeted this decision, Washington insists on enriching its arsenals with this genocidal weapon.\n16.\tAlso in defiance of international opposition, the new American Administration is getting ready to install a new type of missile in Europe. The general arms race, which has gained new impetus in the last few months, is making the ideal conditions for peace even more distant, as well as seriously compromising the perspective for development of the non-industrialized countries.\n17.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Mozambique subscribes entirely to the concerns that have been expressed from this rostrum with regard to the effects of the arms race on world peace and security and on international cooperation and development. Nevertheless, we do not intend to forgo repeating in our turn that the main condition for the establishment of a durable peace is the universal recognition of the right of peoples to their sovereignty and independence and the creation of an international political order based on justice, equality, solidarity and mutual respect.\n18.\tIt has been said that in view of the economic weakness of the developing countries, their acquisition of military equipment is always at the expense of the urgent fight against hunger, nakedness and destitution. But when and why do our countries resort to weapons? We resort to weapons only when we have run out of peaceful means in the attempt to make clear our right to self-determination and national independence. We resort to weapons to defend our permanently threatened sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n19.\tOur countries have undertaken to promote development, and this is possible only in a climate of peace, one in which our sovereignty and all the rights of our peoples are respected.\n20.\tTotal and general disarmament is a profound aspiration of all humanity. But this aspiration cannot be conceived or seen as an obstacle to the peoples' struggles for their self-determination and independence. The very existence of colonialism and the whole system of the exploitation and domination of peoples is one of the main causes of the arms race and the international conflicts in several parts of the world.\n21.\tAgainst that background, we reiterate, as we did on the occasion of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, on disarmament [25th meeting], that disarmament in Africa, the Middle East and Asia implies the eradication of colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, apartheid and Zionism. Support of national liberation movements by every means, including the provisions of arms, is an important condition for the attainment of the objectives of disarmament.\n22.\tWe reiterate our firm support for compliance with the resolutions and decisions taken at the tenth special session of the General Assembly. The implementation of the measures set forth on that occasion would constitute a sure way towards creating the conditions for peace and towards establishing a new type of relations among countries.\n23.\tThe forthcoming special session of the' General Assembly on disarmament, set for 1982, will give us an opportunity to increase our efforts in exploring this important highway to peace.\n24.\tSouthern Africa continues to be one of the areas of serious confrontation between the forces of peace and progress and the reactionary forces which support the exploitation and perpetual domination of peoples. The arrogance, intransigence and crimes perpetrated by the illegal Pretoria regime constitute one of the most brutal manifestations of imperialist aggression.\n25.\tDuring the emergency special session of the General Assembly on Namibia, our delegation analyzed in detail the degrading conditions of life in our area. The Pretoria regime, in spite of the condemnation of the overwhelming majority of the. international community, persists in committing acts of aggression against, and occupying, part of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola. This means that it persists in bombing the civilian population, destroying the economic infrastructure and blockading all productive activity in a seizable area of an independent country, a Member of the United Nations. The actions of the apartheid regime against the People's Republic of Angola are part of a general plan of destabilization of all the States of southern Africa.\n26.\tThe Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Botswana, the Republic of Zambia, the Republic of Zimbabwe and my own country have been subjected to all sorts of provocations, border violations, air space violations, sabotage and armed aggression on the part of Pretoria. This is a planned, systematic and continuous action against the independence of our countries and their national reconstruction efforts, aimed at discrediting our regimes and perpetuating the whole situation of economic dependence left behind by colonialism.\n27.\tIn spite of the clear characterization of the situation in southern Africa, the relevant bodies of the United Nations have not yet been able to translate into concrete action the international repudiation and condemnation of the crimes being committed by apartheid, let alone to stop this kind of action or to make an effective contribution towards compensation for the damages caused.\n28.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique considers that it is the duty of the Organization to demand that the Pretoria regime pay appropriate reparations for the damages caused by its invasion of the People's Republic of Angola, although nothing can adequately compensate for the lost lives, the maimed people and the profound traumas resulting from this criminal action.\n29.\tThe violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola has been adequately opposed by the brave performance of the Angolan armed forces, which are still defending the sacred soil of their country with their blood and their lives. Nevertheless, the international community's denunciation of Pretoria's criminal and reactionary acts must be bolstered by the application of the principle of indemnification, among other types of sanctions. This measure would, besides ascribing responsibility to those who undertook that criminal action, constitute an act of solidarity with those fighting against the shameful policy of apartheid.\n30.\tIt has been sufficiently demonstrated here that the racist illegal minority regime of apartheid is keeping the majority of the inhabitants of South Africa under the crudest kind of colonial conditions characterized by repression, humiliation and total disrespect for human life. Under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC], the people of South Africa are fighting against the racist bullets in a courageous struggle bringing final victory ever closer.\n31.\tSimilarly, the people of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], are bravely resisting the racist invader, thus frustrating all the dilatory tactics and actions aimed at depriving of all content the right of peoples to self-determination and independence.\n32.\tWe consider that we must reiterate in the Assembly the principles which the People's Republic of Mozambique spelled out during the eighth emergency special session, on Namibia [7th meeting]', first, the problem of Namibia must be solved pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the United Nations; secondly, Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the plan it endorses constitute the political and legal framework for a proper transition of the Territory of Namibia; thirdly, the entire international community must shoulder its responsibilities towards the people of Namibia, since Namibia is an international Territory; fourthly, South Africa should be politically, economically and diplomatically isolated. The People's Republic of Mozambique supports the application of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South\nAfrica and considers irrelevant the argument that the imposition of sanctions would not bring about any positive results. It is important that all countries which directly or indirectly collaborate with South Africa adopt unilateral measures to isolate the racist regime, as some countries have already done. For sanctions to be effective, a fundamental prerequisite is that the Western countries which are economic partners and allies of South Africa apply them effectively. Fifthly, the international community must lend material and diplomatic support to SWAPO in its armed struggle for national liberation, which is at the moment the only way to secure final victory for the Namibian people.\n33.\tWe should add to those points that our country supports a negotiated solution based on the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), However, no solution should interfere with the right of the Namibian people to decide for itself its own destiny and the fundamental laws guiding its society.\n34.\tThe efforts of the international community to secure implementation of the General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace free of nuclear weapons have not so far produced any results. The People's Republic of Mozambique reiterates its conviction that there is a pressing need for the adoption of a binding universal legal instrument setting forth the basic principles for the immediate implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, free of nuclear weapons. That is why we underline the need for an international conference to discuss this issue. We also consider the initiative of the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar as a valuable contribution to our efforts to attain this objective. The development of cooperation among the countries of the region and between them and the rest of the international community requires the establishment of a climate of peace in the Indian Ocean.\n35.\tWe have the same concern for the creation of conditions for a just peace and the eradication of focal points of tension, which leads us to concentrate our attention on the development of the situation in the Magreb.\n36.\tThe Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic should occupy its rightful place in the community of nations. At its most recent session the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAV] adopted a resolution on the holding of a referendum concerning self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, under the supervision of the OAU and the United Nations [see A/361534, annex II, resolution AHGIRes. 103 (XVIII)}. It is with concern that we note that the interpretation of that decision of the OAU by the regime of Rabat reveals that there still exist some expansionist intentions that do not correspond to the reality of the military, social and political situations prevailing in Western Sahara. It is the responsibility of the General Assembly to stop the development of any obstacle to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence of the people of Western Sahara. We appeal to the Kingdom of Morocco to honor the commitment entered into at Nairobi by His Majesty King Hassan II to cooperate fully with the OAU in the implementation of the aforementioned decision.\n37.\tIn the Middle East we are faced with renewed aggression by the Zionist regime of Israel. The expansionist ambitions and the premeditated commission of international crimes against human beings that characterize the conduct of the nSgime of Tel Aviv are no longer limited to the Palestinian people and the occupied Arab territories. The borders of genocide and massacre are expanding. The continued bombing of Lebanon, the bombing of the nuclear research center of Iraq, which was built for peaceful purposes, and the threats against Syria and Jordan are all actions which fall within the context of Israel's role as a bastion of the strategic interests of imperialism in the Middle East.\n38.\tThe definitive elimination of the tension in this area, which constitutes a serious threat to world peace and security, will be possible only with the strict application of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, which demand, inter alia, respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to create their own State in Palestine, and the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories.\n39.\tIn the search for a negotiated solution to the Palestinian problem the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], being the main party concerned and the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, can never be excluded.\n40.\tIn East Timor the massacre, repression and genocide of the Maubere people persist. The occupation of the Territory of East Timor by the Djakarta regime is a violation of the principles of international law, which recognizes the legitimacy and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of East Timor. The Organization should not remain indifferent to what is happening in East Timor. It should condemn and demand the immediate withdrawal of the occupation forces of Indonesia from the Territory of East Timor. The Democratic Republic of East Timor must be allowed to take its rightful place in the United Nations. We welcome the effort now being made by Portugal, the administering Power of East Timor, in the search for a solution to this problem. The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms its total support for the just struggle of the Maere people under the direction of FRETILIN,1 its sole legitimate representative.\n41.\tIn the area of the Pacific Ocean two other matters constitute a source of serious concern. One is the presence of United States troops in South Korea, which makes even more difficult the process of the reunification of Korea and leads to the continuation of tension in the zone. The other is the maneuvers that impede the efforts of the People's Republic of Kampuchea to occupy its place in the United Nations. Those maneuvers constitute an insult to the people of Kampuchea and its heroic struggle for liberation.\n42.\tThe dictatorial regimes of Latin America are intensifying their fierce repression of the peoples of that region, which disturbs peace and security and constitutes a serious obstacle to cooperation among the Latin American peoples.\n43.\tWe salute the Salvadorian people, which bravely fights against the Fascist dictatorship that has been imposed upon it. The solution to the problem of El Salvador is necessarily linked with the recognition of the Farabundo Marti Front for NationalLiberation and the Revolutionary Democratic Front, the political forces to be taken into account in the political settlement of the problems of that country. We salute the Government of Mexico and the Government of France for the joint communique issued by them concerning the situation in El Salvador.2\n44.\tWe salute the struggle of the people of Chile and the other peoples of Latin America who resist the dictatorial and Fascist regimes that oppress them. We particularly support the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico for its self-determination and independence.\n45.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique, true to its international principle of solidarity with the peoples fighting for their emancipation and in defense of their sovereignty, demands the strict observance of the Panama Canal accords and withdrawal of the American forces from Guantanamo, a part of the territory of the Republic of Cuba.\n46.\tOur debate in the Assembly is characterized by the depth of the analysis of the problems that are of concern to the international community as a whole. We are identifying the elements that contribute to the deterioration of our relations. We are finding out that the predominant causes of the existence of the zones of tension which proliferate in our various continents are the existence of colonialism, racism, apartheid, and Zionism and the ever increasing arms race.\n47.\tIt is the duty of each one of us to contribute the best of his positive imagination in order to do away with those evil causes. We should primarily strive to put a stop to the arms race and to promote the political and economic emancipation of all peoples. We should strive to create conditions in which all peoples enjoy their right to liberty, peace and progress. All of us should be able to enjoy the progress of science and technology. This is the big challenge that the international community faces in the decade that we have just entered.\n48.\tWe in the People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirm our total commitment to the principles of the Charter and will continue, as always, to contribute in the best possible way to the search for just solutions to the serious problems that the world now faces. The struggle goes on.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, Mr. President, to extend my warm congratulations to you on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election undoubtedly demonstrates great confidence in your abilities and wide experience, which qualify you to steer the work of the session to the success to which we all aspire.\n33.\tI also wish to express my appreciation of the positive contribution made by your predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, in guiding the proceedings of the preceding session. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his sincere, serious and unceasing efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations and its effectiveness in the maintenance of international peace and security and the attainment of justice for all peoples of the world.\n34.\tMy delegation extends a warm welcome to the two new States, Belize and Vanuatu, on their admission to membership in the United Nations. Along with the rest of the Members of this international Organization, we hope\nthat they will contribute to the general good of the international community.\n35.\tThe State of Qatar firmly believes in the rule of law and the active pursuit of the maintenance of world security. Therefore it calls for a renunciation of the policy of hegemony and force practiced by the big Powers. It .is against a resumption of the arms race, which entails confrontation, a return to the policy of cold was; a heightening of tension in international relations, the creation of blocs and alliances and ? threat to peace and security in many regions of our globe. We support the call for disarmament and look forward to the achievement of concrete progress in that field. We also hope that the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament will prove fruitful.\n36.\tThe heightening of rivalry among the big Powers, particularly between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the presence of their military fleets in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea endanger the stability of our region and the independence of its States. Claims of the disruption of security and of the need for some sort of foreign military presence in that region are stark falsehoods and but a pretext for that presence. That presence is not meant to protect the region and preserve its independence; rather, it is an attempt to draw closer to the locations of the adversary.\n37.\tHence, we categorically reject these justifications. We are endeavoring to spare that region from becoming an arena for superPower rivalry and thus to guarantee genuine security for ourselves. The recent meeting of the Gulf Arab States and their agreement to set up the Gulf Cooperation Council proves to the whole world that our States know their common interests best and are keener than all other parties on the maintenance of our security and stability.\n38.\tMy Government follows with deep sorrow the continuance of the hostilities between two neighbors, Iraq and Iran, which it considers to be a bleeding wound afflicting the whole region. We sincerely hope that the ongoing hostilities will end as soon as possible so as to stop bloodshed and spare energy and efforts that\tbe used for the reconstruction, development and welfare of the two States. We support a resumption of the peaceful efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conflict, the United Nations.and the nonaligned movement aimed at securing a ceasefire between the two countries and resolving their conflict peacefully. We sincerely hope that those efforts will be crowned with success and will put an end to that war and thus ensure stability and peace in the area.\n39.\tNeedless to say, security and stability in the Gulf area are organically linked to security in the Middle East, since the former is an integral part of the latter. Neither is it necessary to say that Palestine is at the core of the Middle East question and, as a corollary, peace cannot be preserved in that sensitive region of the world without a just solution of that question. Such a solution is based on the right of the Palestinian people to return to its homeland and to exercise self-determination , in its national territory under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization \\BJjO]\n40.\tIsrael's uprooting of the Arab people of Palestine from its homeland, which led to the dispersal of that people all over the world, its repeated acts of aggression against sovereign Arab States, as in the case of the recent bombing of Lebanon and of the Iraqi nuclear installations, and its occupation of territory by force provide ample material evidence that serves to disclose the true nature of Israel. That nature manifests itself in a colonial, military, settler and expansionist entity that seeks to become the Power with exclusive dominance over the area and is the cat's-paw of certain international policies. The signing of the so-called strategic cooperation agreement between the United States and Israel is irrefutable proof of Israel's modus vivendi of political dependence. The grave menace to all the Arab countries as a consequence of such a policy is very evident.\n\n41.\tWe call on the United States of America, as a superPower, to view this matter from the perspective of international peace. In its foreign relations, it should take into account its interests which are linked with the Arab States in order to create parallel and balanced relations that will ultimately be conducive to the maintenance of peace and security in that sensitive area of the world. Our goal is the achievement of a just peace in the Middle East area, and the attainment of progress and prosperity so that its peoples will be able to contribute to the peace and welfare of the entire world. Inspired by that lofty goal, the State of Qatar subscribes to and unconditionally supports the initiative of Prince Eahd ibn Abdul Aziz, Crown Prince of the fraternal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, aimed at resolving the Middle East question. It considers it to be a positive basis for reaching a settlement and hopes that the international community will wholeheartedly support it for the sake of the maintenance of peace and security and the pursuit of world stability.\n42.\tProceeding from its belief in the right of peoples to self-determination and freedom, the State of Qatar reaffirms its call for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, for the exercise by the Afghan people of its right to self-determination, and for the free choice by that people of own system.\n43.\tWe stand by the Namibian people in the struggle it is waging for independence. The international community, in this connection, is called upon to assume its full responsibility by applying pressure on the racist regime in South Africa to end its racist practices and by making it comply strictly with United Nations resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We also stand by the majority of South Africa in its struggle. We denounce the racist practices and the policy of apartheid systematically pursued by the present racist regime, as well as that regime's continued acts of aggression against neighboring African States. Sanctions must be imposed on this repugnant racist regime.\n44.\tThe situation in SouthEast Asia is still a cause for concern. That region is one of the volatile hotbeds of the international community. The situation in Kampuchea remains critical; it requires an acceptable solution which, we maintain, should be determined by the Kampuchean people itself, free from outside interference.\n45.\tSimilarly, the Korean question should be resolved through dialog' between the parties, without any interference or intervention whatsoever.\n46.\tWe welcome the portion of the Secretary-General's report [A/36/1, sect. IV] which deals with the developments in the ongoing negotiations in Cyprus. We sincerely hope that those efforts will be crowned with success, for the sake of the attainment of world peace and security.\n47.\tThe international community has long looked forward to a comprehensive convention organizing relations between States on all issues relating to the seas. We are grateful that the Organization has adopted this idea and has made painstaking efforts to draft such a convention. After those long and painstaking efforts, it was envisaged that the convention would be concluded this year. However, the new United States administration changed its delegation to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The new delegation has expressed a desire to review and assess the articles of the convention, and consequently its signing has been delayed.\n\n48.\tMy delegation is hopeful that the review process will not be a long one and that agreement on the convention will be reached at the next session of the Conference due to be held in New York in March 1982, for that convention would be conducive to the common good of all the peoples of the earth.\n49.\tThe international community is confronted today with a major challenge, manifested in its efforts to grapple with present economic crises. Those efforts require, in the first place, agreed clearcut identification of the major international economic problems, to be followed by common and concerted efforts on the part of the international community to face those crises and to establish programs and formulate adequate proposals to resolve them.\n50.\tThe State of Qatar wishes once again to draw attention in this forum to the negative economic implications for the developing countries of the present economic policies of the developed countries in the fields of international trade and finance. Foremost among those implications are the balance of payments deficits suffered by the majority of developing countries, internal financial imbalances, increasing grinding inflation and the deterioration of the unemployment problem and the food crisis.\n51.\tThe international community must agree on the fact that the continuing deterioration of economic conditions in the developing countries will undoubtedly have negative implications for the economies of the developed countries themselves. *\n52.\tThe .flow of assistance and loans from the developed to the developing countries generally falls short at present of the target set by the United Nations.\n53.\tWhile acceptance at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris last month, of the principle of the doubling of the development assistance provided to the least developed countries by some developed countries is gratifying, the needs of the developing countries far exceed the assistance they receive.\n54.\tThe State of Qatar views the loss of economic stability in the international arena as a real threat to peace and security in many regions of the globe. It is imperative to resume the NorthSouth dialog in order to establish a new international economic order based on justice and equity, on emergence from the present economic crisis, and on bridging the gap between rich States and poor States.\n55.\tIt is of paramount importance to find feasible and effective formulas for the development of present international economic relations and to seek adequate standards for organizing the efforts to face today's strained economic conditions. However, the heart of the matter here is seen by the developing countries as consisting in the various ways and means of technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries. To some extent, this would compensate the economies of the developing countries for the damage inflicted on them by the depletion of their raw materials and the ever-increasing cost of the manufactured goods they import from the developed countries.\n56.\tBefore concluding, I wish to express the hope that when we next meet here many of the achievements to which we aspire will have been realized. We wish to see a world in which love, peace and stability prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "The United Nations, this parliament of man, offers us a unique opportunity to examine the human condition. We are each called upon to declare our national purposes. We are all obligated to address those problems that obstruct the vision of the Charter.\n158.\tLet us begin with the vision. The Charter of the United Nations reflects cherished dreams of a world distinguished by peaceful change and the resolution of international disputes without resort to force.\n159.\tThe United States believes in these dreams. They offer the best chance of justice and progress for all mankind. They promise a world hospitable to the values of our own society, including a certain idea of man as a creative and responsible individual, democracy and the rule of law.\n160.\tThe ideals of the United Nations are therefore also American ideals. The Charter embodies American principles. It will always be a major objective of our statecraft to make the United Nations an instrument of peace.\n161.\tWe all know that the realization of our dreams cannot depend on hope alone. Obstacles to progress must be overcome through united efforts. The threats to peace are many; suspicions persist; and the price of inaction is great. Truly we face a most difficult agenda.\n162.\tAs 1 make these comments I am reminded that an observer once said of this annual debate: \\\"Every year ... a great and sacred orator . . . preaches before the assembly of nations a solemn sermon on the text of the Charter\\\". Today, however, 1 would like to focus instead on an issue of compelling interest: international development.\n163.\tInternational development reflects the worldwide search for economic progress, social justice and human dignity. Short of war itself, no other issue before us will affect more people, for good or ill, than this search. And peace itself cannot be truly secured if the aspirations of mankind to a better life are frustrated.\n164.\tDevelopment is therefore an enduring issue. It has preoccupied the United Nations from the beginning. It will survive the agenda of this Assembly and every Assembly far into the future. And although great progress has been made we face today a crucial choice of strategy that will dramatically affect the prospects for future success.\n165.\tSince the Second World War the progress of development has been uneven but none the less widespread. Enormous economic growth has been registered: for example, in the last three decades average incomes have actually doubled. There have also been great advances in health. Life expectancy has increased dramatically even in the poorest countries and infant mortality has been reduced.\n166.\tThis experience, however, has not been fully shared by all countries and the prospect for the future is now clouded by recent trends.\n167.\tThe pattern of increasing economic growth, critical for development, has been slowed by inflation, high energy prices, severe balance of payments problems, heavy debt and slower growth of markets. Political turmoil and instability have diverted precious resources into arms and conflict. The necessary synthesis of traditional values and modernization, never easy to achieve, has grown more difficult under the impact of accelerating change.\n168.\tLet us dispense with illusions. We must choose today between two futures: a future of sustainable growth, an expansion of world trade and a reduction of poverty; and a future of economic stagnation, rising protectionism and the spread of poverty. As the World Bank has put it, \\\"By the end of the century, the difference between the two cases amounts to some 220 million more absolutely poor people\\\" .\n169.\tClearly, our task is to give a fresh Impetus to development by devising a new strategy for growth. Such a strategy begins by recognizing the highly Complex and difficult situation we face.\t'\n170.\tThe poorest developing countries require longterm and generous concessional aid from developed and other developing countries to raise productivity through broadly based education and training, improvements in health and nutrition and better infrastructure. They also need sound economic policies, particularly in the agricultural sector. Ultimately, the objective must be to involve them in the international economic system, thereby strengthening opportunities and incentives for self-sustaining growth.\n171.\tThe middle tier developing countries have made significant progress. Nevertheless, they still suffer from widespread poverty. They are also acutely vulnerable to any economic downturn, especially in volatile commodity markets, because of their narrow range of exports. These countries need foreign capital and assistance in developing the experience and creditworthiness to borrow on international capital markets. Technical support and manpower training are important to ensure that their populations are both productive and competitive. They also need an open international trading system to encourage export development.\n172.\tThe more advanced of the developing countries are able to maintain living standards and economic performance comparable to what some of today's industrialized countries achieved less than a generation ago. Their further development is sustained best by a strong international economy with an open capital and trading system. They must be able to pursue national policies that take advantage of the international opportunities and foster domestic adjustment. These countries also play a key role in helping poorer nations, both directly and as policy models.\n173.\tThe capital surplus oil exporting countries need a stable and prosperous international market for their oil exports and a favorable environment in which to invest their financial assets and to develop their domestic economies. The international system must continue to evolve to reflect the growing importance of these countries as they assume increasing responsibility for the management of that system and for assisting poorer nations.\n174.\tFinally, the industrialized countries are today suffering from low rates of growth and high rates of inflation. They are trying to increase savings and investment in order to create employment, improve the environment, eliminate pockets of poverty and adjust to the changing competitiveness of their exports. They must sell more abroad to pay for the increased cost of imported energy.\n175.\tIn a slowly growing world these complex and diverse requirements would become potent sources of conflict. But the struggle for the world product can be avoided. The international economy can help all countries to achieve their objectives through a strategy of growth which creates the resources and the employment needed for progress. This cannot be the task of a single nation. As die report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues, chaired by Willy Brandt, has pointed out: \\\"Above all, the achievement of economic growth in one country depends increasingly on the performance of others\\\".4\n176.\tIt is on this view of a differentiated and interdependent world that we must build a new strategy for growth; but our strategy must also be informed by the lessons of the past. Such lessons, extracted from hard experience, offer the basis for principles to guide us through these austere and difficult times.\n177.\tFirst, development is facilitated by an open international trading system. Developed and developing countries together face the challenge of strengthening GATT and the international trading system to create mutual export opportunities for all.\n178.\tToday the trading system is under enormous stress\u2014rising protectionist pressures, new and subtle types of import barriers, restrictive bilateral arrangements, export subsidies and investment policies which distort trade. These are especially troublesome in a period of slow growth. Unless they are reduced or eliminated the international trading system will be seriously weakened. Such a setback to the world economy would inflict the most suffering on the developing countries.\n179.\tThe industrialized countries have a special responsibility to work for a more open trading system with improved rules. We also look to the more successful developing countries to play a fuller role in strengthening the trading system. It will be difficult for each of our countries individually to open markets further unless we are committed to doing so collectively.\n180.\tFor our part, the United States has long supported open markets. Despite current complications, America remains a strong advocate of free trade. Although our gross national product is only one third of the Western industrialized group's total, the United States imports roughly one half of all manufactured goods exported by developing countries. Earnings of developing countries not members of OPEC from exports to the United States amount to some $60 billion more than double the foreign aid coming from all Western developed countries.\n181.\tWe call upon all members of the international community to join in resisting the growth of protectionism. Developing nations must have the greatest possible opportunity to sell their commodities and manufactured products. Let us also work together to achieve a successful conclusion of the multi-fibre agreement.\n182.\tA dynamic and successful trading system requires a smoothly functioning international financial system. We must therefore continue to work with other countries to encourage their support for IMF and their constructive participation in the Bind's programs to facilitate adjustment. We will continue to cooperate with our developing country colleagues to strengthen the Fund. We share the view that the responsibilities of the developing countries should be increased to keep pace with their growing economic importance.\n183.\tSecondly, foreign assistance coupled with sound domestic policy and self-help can facilitate the development process. The United States has long believed in assistance as an effective tool in helping to promote development. Over the last three decades the United States has given more than $130 billion in concessional assistance; over the last decade alone the total has exceeded $50 billion; In 1980 the American people provided $7.1 billion, almost twice as much as any other donor.\n184.\tThe United States has also been a major force in the creation and support of the multilateral development banks. The banks represent an important and to many countries an essential feature in the international financial system. In the last five years the United States has authorized and appropriated an average of $1.5 billion per year for support of the multilateral banks. There is no question about their value as development institutions. As intermediaries they help to mobilize the resources of international capital markets to lend to developing countries. The banks' loans for key projects are important catalysts for productive domestic and foreign private investment.\n185.\tWe recognize that many of the poorer developing countries must continue to rely heavily on concessional assistance for some time to come. Moreover, certain kinds of vital development programs will not pay the quick and direct financial returns needed to attract private capital. For this reason a continuing bilateral assistance program and continuing support for the multilateral banks will be essential.\n186.\tGiven today's economic conditions and the limitation on aid budgets in many countries, it is especially important that concessional assistance be utilized as effectively as possible; that it focus on countries which need it most and which use it best; and that it be a more effective catalyst for mobilizing other foreign and domestic resources. We must also recognize that a strategy for growth that depends on a massive increase in the transfer of resources from the developed to the developing countries is simply unrealistic. *\n187.\tThirdly, regional cooperation and bilateral consultations can be effective in promoting development. The United States is working with other regional States to promote economic progress in the Caribbean area. We are convinced that the example of the recent multinational cooperation in the case of Jamaica and the broader Caribbean Basin initiative holds promise for other regions.\n188.\tWe are already committed to a close working relationship with the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN]. We have benefited considerably from a better understanding of ASEAN's views on multilateral issues and on ways to strengthen our bilateral commercial ties. The United StatesASEAN Business Council is a model of how our private sectors can work together for mutual benefit.\n189.\tIn Africa we look forward to a close working relationship with the Economic Community of West African States as it attempts to strengthen economic ties within the region. Constructive consultations on trade and investment issues have already occurred. We believe that mutually beneficial cooperation can be strengthened to our common benefit. Similar consultations with the developing countries of southern Africa are desirable. We have a strong interest in the economic health and stability of those nations. Commercial relationships, along with foreign assistance, will help us to attain that objective.\n190.\tThe United States has also worked with the capital surplus members of OPEC on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis. We have been able to combine resources to attack development problems of common interest, such as food production. This cooperation should be continued and expanded.\n191.\tFinally, we plan to make bilateral consultative groups between our Government and those of developing countries more effective and to give full support to similar private sector arrangements. The United States Chamber of Commerce and its counterparts in many developing countries have developed particularly good relationships. We fully support these efforts and those of the private voluntary agencies. We are searching for means to work more closely with them.\n192.\tIn all of these cases the United States recognizes the need to be sensitive to the diverse character of the societies involved and to the international circumstances in which development must occur.\n193.\tFourthly, growth for development is best achieved through reliance on incentives for individual economic performance. The individual is the beginning, the key element and the ultimate beneficiary of the development process. The greatest potential for development lies in the hard work and ingenuity of the farmer, the worker and the entrepreneur. They need incentives to produce and the opportunity to benefit from their labors.\n194.\tSuppression of economic incentives ultimately suppresses enthusiasm and invention, and the denial of personal freedom can be as great an obstacle to productivity as the denial of reward for achievement.\n195.\tHistory cautions against regimes that regiment their people in the name of ideals, yet fail to achieve either economic or social progress. Those Governments that have been more solicitous of the liberties of their people have also been more successful in securing both freedom and prosperity.\n196.\tThe United States can offer what it knows best from its own experience. We have seen that policies which encourage private initiatives will promote better resource allocation and more rapid economic growth. Within a framework basically hospitable to market incentives, foreign private investment can supplement indigenous investment and contribute significantly to development.\n197.\tBut our goal is not to impose either our economic values or our judgments on anyone. In the final analysis, each country's path to development will be shaped by its own history, philosophy and interests.\n198.\tFifthly, development requires a certain measure of security and political stability. Political insecurity is a major barrier to development. Fear and uncertainty stifle the productivity of the individual. Scarce resources are squandered in conflict.\n199.\tThe close relationship between security and development cannot be ignored. We are therefore committed to maintain and, where possible, to increase programs essential to deter international aggression and to provide the domestic security necessary to carry out sound economic programs. We have no intention of providing foreign assistance, moral comfort or the prestige of international platforms to countries that foster international violence.\n200.\tThe United Nations has a key role to play in resolving conflict and promoting international stability. We welcome the SecretaryGeneral's efforts to promote inter communal talks and a just settlement on Cyprus. We support a continuing role by the SecretaryGeneral's representative in the IranIraq conflict And South Korea's attempts to initiate a dialog with the North epitomize the search for a peaceful settlement that is at the heart of the Charter.\n201.\tOne of the greatest dangers to the Charter today and to development itself is the willful violation of the national integrity of both Afghanistan and Cambodia by the Soviet Union and Viet Nam. Their behavior challenges the basic rights of all sovereign States. The world's hopes for peace, for security and for development will be jeopardized if \\\"might makes right\\\" becomes the law of nations.\n202.\tThe United States will continue to support security and stability as essential to progress. This is the basis of our active and continuing efforts to strengthen and expand the ceasefire in southern Lebanon. We shall also assist the negotiations specified by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) in order to bring a just and lasting peace to the Middle East. Our policy is to remain a credible and reliable party in the negotiations to bring independence to Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and in a fashion acceptable to both the nations concerned and the international community.\n203.\tThe United States also believes that efforts to control arms either among regional States or between superPowers can make an important contribution to the security that facilitates development. But these efforts do not occur in a vacuum. The international community has tended over the years to overestimate the beneficial effects of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] in dampening regional conflict. We have also tended to underestimate the impact of such conflict on the negotiations themselves.\n204.\tThe United States is strongly committed to balanced and verifiable arms control. We are equally committed to the peaceful resolution of regional disputes. Clearly the restraint implied by arms control must become a more widespread phenomenon if such agreements are to survive and to make their proper contribution to a more secure environment for development.\n205.\tThe United States is confident that a strategy for growth guided by these principles can succeed. We believe that three areas of action deserve immediate international attention.\n206.\tThe first is a global expansion of trade. Plans could be formulated for the 1982 GATT ministerial meeting with special concerns of growth in mind. A major priority should be to integrate more fully the developing countries into the international trading system on the basis\nof shared responsibilities and shared benefits.\n207.\tThe second area is an increase in investment. Our common objective should be to stimulate domestic and international private investment. We must encourage and support the individual investor.\n208.\tThe third is stronger international cooperation in food and in energy. The recent United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy recommended that the developing countries be assisted in assessing their energy resources and determining the best way to exploit them.3 The United Nations Development program and the World Bank have important follow-up responsibilities. We must all work to engage more effectively private participation in exploration and production in oil importing developing nations.\n209.\tDomestic and international action must also go hand in hand to achieve food security. The United States continues to be the largest donor of food aid and places a paramount emphasis on its bilateral program to help developing countries increase food production. Greater attention should also be given to scientific and technological research that will yield more bountiful food supplies.\n210.\tI have outlined today the broad principles that guide America's approach to a new strategy for growth. In the immediate future, and prior to the Cancun meeting, we will announce specific proposals to deal with this and other issues of development.\n211.\tThese broad principles reflect our view that the United States can and indeed will continue to make an essential contribution to the process of development. We do not claim to have all the answers, but we believe that our collective responsibilities for the future allow no more time to be lost in sterile debate and unrealistic demands. The time has come for a reasoned dialog with promise for the future,\n212.\tThe search for economic progress, social justice and human dignity has been supported by the American people, themselves an example of successful development. Our initiatives and resources, through bilateral programs, the United Nations and other multilateral agencies, have made major contributions to the process of modernization throughout the world. For the United States, support of development constitutes a practical imperative.\n213.\tAt the Ottawa meeting the United States reaffirmed its willingness to join its partners in exploring all avenues of consultation and cooperation with developing countries. In October President Reagan will go to the meeting in Cancun. He looks forward to a genuine and open exchange of views on questions of economic development and international cooperation. That meeting offers a novel opportunity to gain fresh understandings of the problems we face together. The United States will join in a constructive and cooperative spirit. Our objective is to bring about a new era of growth. But the purpose of both growth and development goes beyond simple materialism. As Winston Churchill said: \\\"Human beings and human societies are not structures that are built, or machines that are forged. They are plants that grow and must be treated as such\\\".\n214.\tDespite the difficulties of the moment, we should go forward in a spirit of optimism. We have the vision bequeathed to us by this Charter. We have the potential of all the peoples represented in this Hall. Let us go forward together to achieve a new era of growth for all mankind.\n"

These hopes have constantly had to confront the grave problems and dangers that continue to threaten world peace and security and to divide the nations of the world. But I am also conscious of the accomplishments of the United Nations in the past 40 years in advancing some of our common aspirations. There is progress towards greater equity in economic opportunity. We have avoided generalized world conflict. Appalling wars have occurred, but they have been contained. The United Nations role in these achievements is especially significant when we consider the limitations that we, as Member States, have placed on its capacity to act.\n3.\tI congratulate our SecretaryGeneral on his own tireless efforts over the years. I wish particularly to place in review today the notion of the United Nations place in world affairs because I am very conscious of the fact that it is almost 20 years exactly since one of the Secretary General's forerunners, the great Dag Hammarskjold, was killed, in the service of world peace and of our Organization.\n4.\tThe sort of world problems that existed 20 years ago are a gauge for measuring how far we have come, if indeed we have come any distance at all, in our search for the truly better world that we were then after. A simple judgment is not easy. The world was dangerous then and it is dangerous now. But some of the dangers today are different than they were in 1961. It requires adaptation on the part of the States Members of the Organization to deal with them. We are entitled to ask whether it is not because of difficulties in adapting the Organization to change, as well as the restrictions that we have placed in it, that the United Nations impact on world problems has not been greater.\n5. Not all of today's problems are different. Sadly, some of the problems then are still with us today white minority domination in South Africa, for example, and South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia, or the seemingly intractable problems of the Middle East. Others have appeared to work their way back into our preoccupations, such as features of EastWest competition that for a time had receded from the forefront of our attention.\n6.\tBut, whatever the problems, there is a constant need to adapt to change. As I emphasized here at last year's session [4th meeting], change is natural and inevitable. Our greatest challenge is to adapt to that change, not to resist it.\n7.\tMany of us here are meliorists, who hold that we can encourage change for the better and that the role of the Organization is central to the promotion of a better life for all the world's inhabitants. But even if we were not thus optimistic, we would still wish the United Nations to be effective in dealing with the problems that are within its mandate and in changing to cope with threats in the world today.\n8.\tDag Hammarskjold died in 1961, along with other devoted members of the United Nations Secretariat,, to whom I also pay homage, in an attempt to assist the progress of decolonization in Africa, to preserve the territorial integrity of a newly independent State and to resist the designs of countries and interests from there and elsewhere which, for reasons of self-interest or nostalgia, meant to subvert the changes which were taking place. 1 think that Hammarskjold died with a vision of the United Nations peacemaking and peacekeeping capability which was resisted then and which has been resisted since. But at least the process of political decolonization which seized our attention in those years has now been virtually completed. And, while I ask myself how many newly independent States enjoy today the sort of economic and political security and opportunity which they so bravely expected at the outset of their struggle for independence, it is perhaps illusory to tie their development to the notion of national independence. Self-determination, yes; but in 1981 we are much more deeply conscious of our global interdependence the interdependence of States, of economies, of peoples and of dangers.\n9.\tEconomically, our interdependence is more authentically reciprocal. Twenty years ago the economic relationships between North and South were much more those of the classical form of colonial dependence. The idea that most industrialized countries of the world would by now be purchasing 30 and 40 per cent of their imported manufactured goods in developing countries would have\nSeemed far-fetched in 1961. Indeed, this interdependence in trade is an increasingly important feature of our view of international economic affairs. Its reflection in international decision-making is necessary. This, as well as our concern for equity in opportunity, helps to explain why Canada is a strong supporter of the need for a global negotiating process.\n10.\tThere has been remarkable progress in the economic development of many developing countries since 1961. But still for many in the world the basic conditions of life are just as impoverished now as they were then. The apparent inability to aid these people in the dimensions required is an indictment we must accept. But, sadly, we must also accept that the economic expectations many held for the world in 1961, and for the industrialized countries in particular, were exaggerated. Were those years of unprecedented boom an aberration? Do we need to live now 'with diminished expectations for growth in the future? If so, it is our obligation to find ways to deal with world problems within the limits of a more stringent environment now than in 1961 and to redouble our efforts, with discipline and dedication, to direct our attentions to where they are really vitally needed.\n11.\tInterdependence and its relationship to self-determination are a global political as well as economic reality. We are all neighbors, and strategically so. IWenty years ago the EastWest strategic focus was mainly on Europe. Today the risk of confrontation between the superPowers in areas normally considered to be part of the third world is also enhanced. There is a risk of aggravating problems already anguishing enough in terms of the turbulence and fragility of the conditions of underdevelopment and conflict indigenous to the regions in question. I call for a look backward to those contemporaries of Hammarskjold who saw in nonalignment an opportunity for developing countries to concentrate on the problems before them without the threat of interference in their affairs from more powerful countries intent on diverting their assets to their own purposes. I say that true nonalignment is not only consistent with interdependence but more necessary because of it.\n12.\tIs it possible that in the last 20 years the nature of EastWest tension has changed because the Soviet Union is today a military super-Power with a capability of intervention which ranges far and wide? This capability can constitute a threat to world peace as well as to the non alignment of countries as long as it is the instrument, in Afghanistan as well as in Kampuchea, of cynical real politik. Let us recognize that, if the strategic interests of great Powers are now in fact interdependent with events in the third world, then there is a need, above all, for great restraint on all our parts.\n13.\tAll these circumstances in 1981 call for a United Nations which is more meaningful and more relevant to global concerns and events, not less. As the challenges to all of us increase in complexity and urgency, the need for more sophisticated, flexible and responsive instruments to meet them grows apace. The problems of the rest of the century and beyond englobe the ecology and use of our land, our space and our seas, as well as the security of peoples and their rising expectation in a world concentrated through technology.\n14.\tFor instance, take the applications of nuclear technology. In 1961 most countries here were consoled by progress in negotiating a nuclear test ban treaty. It looked then as if we were headed towards a halt in the arms race. It was a brief illusion. Today it is one of the most unequivocally disturbing features of international life, and indeed of our interdependence, that the dangers of nuclear war are now even greater. Nuclear proliferation threatens on two axes: the horizontal spread of nuclear weapons to previously non-nuclear weapon States and the vertical amassing of even greater numbers of weapons by the superPowers urge in the name of sanity that this danger be recognized and resisted.\n15.\tWe must enable the institutions of the United Nations to be more productive, not less, and we must encourage all countries to participate actively in the pursuit of solutions in these institutions. In doing so, we can demonstrate that we wish to make them relevant and productive for the general benefit, adapted to the shape of the world today. Many of my remaining remarks are directed to prospects for development in countries which were still colonies 20 years ago, and this reflects the interdependence of our interests and purposes today. But the political and economic problems of the world intersect and interact. It is important that the Organization adapt itself as well through greater sharing in the exercise of power and responsibility. Can we not ask ourselves if some of the notions of Dag Hammarskjold with regard to a stronger United Nations in the interests of world peace and security cannot today be generally seen as more reasonable than they were 20 years ago? It is my view that they are certainly every bit as necessary.\n16.\tSurely the continued occupation of Afghanistan by foreign military forces is an example of precisely the sort of threat to world peace and security which the United Nations was meant to prevent. The courage and determination of the resistance is an ennobling assertion of the human spirit against the machinery of military oppression, but the tragic facts reflect a basic fault in the notion of collective security. When a powerful country wishes to ignore United Nations decisions, it will feel free to do so unless its actions remain the object of continued international attention. The continued presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan is an affront to the principles of the Organization.\n17.\tI call on the Soviet Government to honor those principles and also the ideals of international conduct which the Soviet Union itself is pledged to follow. I ask that it respond positively to international efforts, including reestablishing a truly independent and nonaligned Government in Afghanistan, a Government which can reflect without outside interference the real will of the Afghan people.\n18.\tAs has been emphasized by the countries of the region, the situation in Kampuchea is also a threat to peace and security. A first attempt has been made to cope with the political problems that lie at the heart of the Kampuchean question, and we now know that a settlement should cover a ceasefire on the ground, the supervised withdrawal of foreign troops, the holding of free elections under United Nations supervision and the adoption of appropriate measures to ensure that those elections are not disturbed by the armed factions in Kampuchea. Canada supports these proposals made at the International Conference on Kampuchea and contained in the Declaration of the Conference, because they appear to provide the necessary guarantees for all the parties to the conflict. We also endorse the establishment by the Conference of an ad hoc committee to study and apply the measures necessary to enable the proud Kampuchean people to decide on its own future. We urge the Members of this Organization to take this opportunity to resolve this tragic situation and to promote at long last a lasting peace in South East Asia.\n\n19.\tThe self-determination sought for both Afghanistan and Kampuchea is one of the historic themes of the United Nations. It has been a central focus of the non aligned movement, of which both Afghanistan and Kampuchea are members. It was also 20 years ago this month that the first meeting of the movement was held in Belgrade. I salute what the movement has done to advance the rights of newly emerging countries.\n20.\tToday this ideal of self-determination is celebrated with the attainment of independence by Belize. This is an achievement for the United Nations in which Canada takes particular satisfaction as a longtime cosponsor of United Nations resolutions on the subject. While Canada is disappointed that talks between the United Kingdom, Belize and Guatemala have not led to the resolution of all outstanding issues, we are encouraged that there is a real commitment on the part of all parties to the promotion of peace in the region, which must include a Anal agreement on Belize. We are confident that the Governments of Belize and Guatemala will settle the issues between them in a peaceful and durable manner.\n21.\tBut if the independence of Belize represents an event to celebrate, how depressing it is again to contemplate on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly the same issues affecting southern Africa that the United Nations has been pronouncing itself on for decades. I was speaking earlier of the dynamics of change in human affairs and of the futility of resisting the strength of human aspiration to self-determination. But in South Africa in 1981 resistance to change has increased. I have no doubt that justice will come for the victims of racism in South Africa, for the majority whose human dignity is abused in an affront to us all. I sympathize with the impatience of those who shudder at abiding any longer, for another generation, another decade or two, the oppression of apartheid. But I counsel wisdom in choosing methods of promoting the freedom of these people, for we must not let differences over tactics serve to weaken our unity in that purpose.\\\"\n22.\tIn Namibia, too, the intransigence of the South African Government remains the sole obstacle to a negotiated settlement. Our only goal is to enable the Namibian people to gain their independence at last and the right to a free and fair election in which all Namibians can take part under United Nations supervision. Canada supports unconditionally Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations plan which theCouncil has embraced by that resolution, and we have been active, particularly in the contact group and with African States, in pursuing that goal.\n23.\tIn the Middle East there is also conflict, and at its center is the ArabIsraeli dispute, as old as the United Nations itself. We cannot afford further delay in moving towards a negotiated settlement to this generations old conflict, a settlement in which all the interested parties must participate. Israelis and Palestinians have legitimate rights and concerns which must be taken into account, Israel's quest for security and recognized boundaries and the right to be fully accepted by its neighbors can be met only in a political, not a military, framework. The same holds true for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including their right to a homeland within a clearly defined territory the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n24.\tI therefore urge all the parties concerned to summon the vision and the will required to take decisions which are as necessary as they are difficult. Among the areas where progress is urgently needed, none is more pressing than measures to ensure that the Middle East will remain free of nuclear weapons.\n25.\tAnother early concern of the United Nations was the Korean peninsula. There too the SecretaryGeneral is performing a useful good offices role. We are encouraged by the recent initiatives of the Republic of Korea for dialog and reconciliation without conditions and for the greater integration of the peninsula into the international community.\n26.\tThe United Nations is also playing a valuable role in Cyprus, where peacekeeping and peacemaking are proceeding in parallel under the SecretaryGeneral's leadership. We hope that the approaches now being considered in negotiations between the two communities will lead to the just and lasting comprehensive settlement they both desire.\n27.\tIt is in Cyprus that the oldest and largest of Canada's present peacekeeping contingents is serving. Twenty-five years after the introduction of United Nations peacekeeping forces to world affairs, I see the Cyprus force as accomplishing an important role, encouraging us to believe in the notion of collective security through recourse to negotiation instead of conflict.\n28.\tThat is also the notion involved in our attempt to advance the rule of law at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. I should like to associate myself with the statement made by the SecretaryGeneral at the opening of the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, on 9 March, when he said:\n\\\"Apart from the achievement of the specific objectives of this Conference, I attach the highest importance to the impact which its success may have in strengthening the role of the United Nations in finding viable solutions to great global issues.\\\"3\n29.\tI wish to emphasize that the Conference is not merely an attempt to codify technical rules of law. It is a resource Conference; it is a food Conference; it is an environmental Conference; it is an energy Conference; it is a conservation Conference; it is an economic Conference; it is a maritime boundary delimitation Conference; it is a territorial limitation and jurisdictional Conference; it is a transportation, communications and freedom of navigation Conference; it is a Conference which regulates all the\nuses of the oceans by humanity. Most important it is a Conference which provides for the peaceful settlement of disputes concerning the oceans. It is, in other words, a Conference dedicated to the rule of law among nations.\n30.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ranks in importance with the San Francisco Conference founding the United Nations itself. It represents an extremely important element in the NorthSouth dialog. It has significant implications for peaceful East West relations. It touches on the interests of every State great or small, rich or poor, coastal or landlocked. The achievement of a universal agreement on a Law of the Sea Convention is fundamental to world peace and security.\n31.\tOf course, international peace and security, as well as development, freedom and life itself, will ultimately depend on whether we can successfully work towards arms control id disarmament. International security can be consistent with lower levels of armaments and expenditures. The coming special session on disarmament must point the way to more concrete progress than in recent years if credibility is to be maintained. Deliberations on disarmament at this session of the General Assembly can be of crucial importance in preparation. The remarkable consensus reached in 1978 needs reaffirmation and further direction.\n32.\tIt is true that the international climate is less favorable today. At the same time, we cannot ignore the growing impatience of the world's peoples with the lack of progress towards verifiable arms limitation and disarmament agreements. Our efforts on their behalf should take into account the situation as it is in covering realistic proposals which have some substantive chance to effect change. The Canadian Government recently reaffirmed the validity of the concept of the strategy of suffocation mentioned in the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly on disarmament [resolution ; SJ0/2], Embracing that strategy are Canada's priorities on preparations for the second special session. They are: to encourage the continuation of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]; to promote the attainment of a multilateral comprehensive test ban treaty; to assist in the preparation of a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and on their destruction; to promote the evolution of an effective nonproliferation regime based on the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons; and to participate in. negotiations to limit and reduce conventional forces. Canada is committed to breaking the pattern of madness which spiraling rearmament represents, and those priorities will guide our endeavors to fulfill this commitment.\n33.\tI have spoken about the far reaching quests for peace, self-determination and development. These are the forces by which pervasive change can be channeled in positive directions. They are as new as today and as old as humankind; constants amid change. They have found eloquent expression in the ideals of our Charter, and I urge our re-dedication to them.\n34.\tBut there is none so pervasive as the quest for human dignity for the individual and for his rights. That is why the United Nations enshrined in its Charter, as a primary objective, the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. There has been the development of several important\nhuman rights instruments since, most notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the stewardship of the implementation of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights there is the expert and responsible role of the Human Rights Committee. It is an example of the ability of the international community to promote internationally recognized standards.\n35.\tThe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is an equally significant covenant needing serious and expert review. There are areas in which international standards have yet to be established. We applaud the placing before this Assembly for adoption of a draft declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief.4\n36.\tBut, while we welcome the continuing development of international human rights standards, we are deeply conscious that despite these the grossest abuses occur; the lives, freedom and integrity of innocent persons are constantly swept aside in the name of one cause, or power struggle, or another. If the United Nations provides relief unhesitatingly to the victims of natural disasters, how can we do less when the crises are man-made?,\n37.\tThe United Nations has the means to respond. It can, for example, employ the good offices of the SecretaryGeneral; it can provide for the urgent dispatch of a special rapporteur or a mission of inquiry. All that is needed is the will to act in providing protection for those individuals or groups whose situation has become perilous in situations of social breakdown.\n38.\tOn the subject of human rights and massive exodus, Canada welcomed the adoption of our proposal to appoint a special rapporteur. We trust that the experience of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan in that role will lead to the adoption of a report which provides insight into how the United Nations organizations and Member States can together prevent refugee situations from reaching existing proportions. We believe that report should provide an impartial basis for examining broader aspects of international refugee problems, including, for example, the proposed initiative by, the Federal Republic of Germany regarding international guidelines for preventing massive flows of refugees.\n39.\tEven in more tranquil situations, there is work to be done. This is the International Year of Disabled Persons, to promote the right of more than 500 million disabled' people throughout the world to full participation and equality in a barrier-free world.\n40.\tAnd there is the position of women in all countries and the need to improve their condition socially and politically and to promote the equality of women with men. An important step in this direction is the recent entry into force, on 3 September 1981, of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\n41.\tCollective world concern for individual human rights and for organized efforts to promote the rights of women and the specifically disadvantaged are important recent phenomena. These issues are concerned with individuals, with the lives of people and groups of people, and will continue to receive much attention in international forums.\n42.\tAt the level of nations, the emergence during the last 30 years of some 100 sovereign States must be counted as one of the most significant changes the world has ever seen. Dag Hammarskjold was of course centrally involved in the process of assisting these new States to enter into the life of this institution. This was a period of birth and hope. But for many of those new States, perhaps for most, this hope was quickly tempered by the economic realities which faced them.\n43.\tOne reality which was evident immediately to the new States was that any economic interdependence which then applied was heavily skewed on the side of dependence and vulnerability for them. It was an asymmetrical relationship. The developing countries were acutely aware of this, but the developed world was not. That has now changed. I think that the change in perception on the part of developed countries towards the reality of global interdependence is of great significance, even a source of hope.\n44.\tThe growing realization that to an increasing extent our economic futures are linked can spur us towards solutions. The Brandt Report9 has, I think, contributed in this regard. In particular, there has been an increased awareness of the contribution of the developing countries to the overall world economy. It is now projected that between 1980 and 1990 developing countries will account for more than a quarter of the increase in world trade. These statistics mask, of course, important differences among the various developing countries most involved as well as the relative impact of these changes on individual economies. But they indicate that developing countries are moving closer to the center of the world economic stage.\n45.\tInterdependence also has a price. It tends to make all nations more vulnerable to shocks from the outside and from forces beyond the control of national Governments. It is therefore of paramount importance that the international institutions which provide the frameworks for the international economic system function effectively. If they do not, if they become deadlocked and divided along bloc lines, or if they become hostage to narrow interests, then the international economy will suffer. In these circumstances, interdependence becomes a liability and all States suffer.\n46.\tInflation, high interest rates and sluggish growth pose real problems for the industrialized countries. The constraints on export growth and financing are mounting in the middle-income developing countries. It is, however, the low-income countries, particularly the least developed, which are the most vulnerable and whose prospects are the bleakest. Whether from oil shocks or high inter-strata shocks, they have suffered most.\n47.\tThe rising prices and diminishing supply of conventional petroleum reserves have had a major impact on all of us, but the impact of the two oil shocks of the 1970s has had a disproportionate effect on the developing countries, setting back the development plans of many of them. Canada agrees that a high priority in international action should be accorded to their energy needs. It is because energy is central to development that Canada supports the expansion of World Bank energy lending, including lending through a new energy affiliate if this were eventually feasible, to assist developing countries in their energy programs.\n48.\tIn Canada we have responded to this need by creating a new development assistance arm of our national oil company, PetroCanada International, devoted to aiding oil-importing developing countries in the mobilization of their own energy resources, particularly hydrocarbons. Effort and imagination must also be used to seek out ways of assisting developing countries in non-petroleum sources of energy. The recent United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy was important in this respect, but represented a single step on a long and difficult road.\n49.\tJust as Canada's economic structure and expertise favor development assistance in the energy area, so we also intend to make a major contribution to helping to improve agricultural production in developing countries. While international trade in food products has increased dramatically in recent decades, many nations which were previously self-sufficient in staple products, and even significant exporters of them, have become today reliant on food imports, particularly food grains. There is a real prospect of a food crisis in the 1980s and urgent international attention is needed on this problem.\n50.\tI have spoken of energy and food areas where Canada can make a unique contribution but I would like also to say a few words about trade, for it is perhaps trade which, in the long run, offers the best promise of escape from the wheel of poverty for many countries.\n51.\tDeveloping countries have seized important new opportunities to increase trade among themselves. But northern markets continue to be crucial, and future prospects for expanding NorthSouth trade will depend to a large extent on the ability of industrial countries to develop effective adjustment strategies which can maintain a reasonable rate of economic growth employment. In fact, the relative significance of NorthSouth trade has grown in recent years compared with trade just among the industrialized countries. Now, a number of the most advanced developing countries represent the potential trade partnerships of greatest opportunity for many developed countries. All countries will benefit from an open, universal international trading system, and Canada will continue to pursue this goal. This would be our focus at the new proposed ministerial meeting of GATT in 1982..\n52.\tThe export prospects of developing countries are also an increasingly important factor in the health of the international payments system and of international banking. For the foreseeable future, developing countries will continue to need substantial external finance, whether in the form of private investment, commercial loans Or concessional loans and grants. While private banking continues to play a major role in recycling, the international financial institutions must be increasingly involved. We support renewed effort by IMF and the World Bank in this direction. But for many of the low-income countries, the ability to participate in the expansion of world trade is limited; so is their access to commercial credit. If poverty in those countries is to be attacked and social justice demands this then greater amounts of concessional assistance must be directed to them. There is no way around this issue: development assistance is vital and urgently needed, and the world is not providing enough of it.\n53.\tThe recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Paris from 1 to 14 September 1981 was an important contribution to progress. Widespread consensus was achieved in the international community for the setting of objectives to be pursued by recipients and for the projections from donors of significant additional official development assistance in real terms during this decade. Taken together, these hold promise for advancing substantially the development of States most in need.\n54.\tThe Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted in Paris not only set an important course for achieving progress with respect to the least developed countries but provides a guide for approaching vitally needed interaction between developed and developing countries on a range of subjects on the NorthSouth agenda. Key portions of the Substantial New Program of Action became known as the \\\"Canadian Compromise\\\". Canada was pleased to be associated with those vital conclusions because they demonstrated that constructive agreement can be reached on a subject of vital importance to the developing countries. In keeping with the role my country played in Paris, I urge that the momentum and techniques generated there be pursued during this session of the Assembly and during other international meetings addressing relations between developing and developed countries.\n55.\tAs a result of the Paris achievement, which Canada helped to create, and in the context of translating that achievement into concrete reality, I am pleased to announce today that Canada will devote 0.15 per cent of its gross national product as official development assistance to the least developed countries in the coming years.\n56.\tThis pledge is in the context of the announcement I made at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly on development last year [4th meeting] that Canada would reverse the trend of previous years and increase our official development assistance to ensure that we are soon at 0.5 per cent of gross national product as part of an effort to reach 0.7 per cent by the end of the decade. I am pleased that we have remained on that upward track.\n57.\tI spoke earlier of the fact that interdependence means that international economic cooperation is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity without which interdependence becomes a liability.\n58.\tWe must look towards deeper global economic cooperation, yet solutions to world economic problems will not always be global. The progress made at the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries in Caracas last May is a case in point. Relations with developing countries was the major focus of a number of high-level consultations among industrialized countries in particular the June ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Ottawa summit. I want to take this opportunity to report very briefly to the Assembly on the latter meeting.\n59.\tThe Ottawa summit devoted considerable time to the issue of economic relations between developed and developing countries. In the communique the leaders agreed on a joint statement reflecting those discussions. They underlined an appreciation of the magnitude of the problems and a common readiness to help respond to them. Overall, the message to our developing country partners signaled the following: respect for independence and support for genuine nonalignment; commitment to cooperate in a spirit of mutual interest and interdependence; support for closer integration of developing countries into the international economic system, as well as support for their efforts to promote development within the framework of their own social values and traditions.\n60.\tMoreover, we sought at this meeting to address the key problems of energy, food, trade and finance in a positive and constructive way. We pledged to maintain substantial and, in many cases, growing levels of official development assistance, the major portion of which will be directed to poorer countries. Of signal importance was our affirmation at this meeting of our willingness to participate in preparations for a process of global negotiations. It has been encouraging to me that both developed and developing countries have expressed their appreciation of the results of the Ottawa Summit.\n61.\tAnother important initiative in NorthSouth relations this year will be the meeting of 22 Heads of State and Government of North and South to be held at CaQSun. We hope that this meeting will foster understanding of the key NorthSouth issues and give political impetus to their resolution in whatever forums may be appropriate. We do not see this meeting as a substitute for global negotiations. No non-universal forum can be. But we do see it as a catalyst for them. And while the nature of the North South meeting precludes participation by, all of the interested parties, we welcome the link with the United Nations as represented by the presence at Cancun of the Secretary-General.\n62.\tWhile we admit the value of summits, however, universally determined multilateral agreements remain fundamental to our search for effective solutions to global problems. For this reason, a large degree of consensus has been reached on the launching of global negotiations. While admitting that compromise on all sides will be necessary in that process, I believe there is new willingness to face that challenge. Preparatory discussions will resume during this session, and I pledge Canada's determination to work for a successful outcome.\n63.\tIn Canada during the past year we have taken a number of steps to enable us to play a more active and constructive role in international cooperation in those vital areas. A Parliamentary task force on NorthSouth relations submitted a major and invaluable report. It advocated strongly that Canada continue to play an active NorthSouth role, based on the principles of mutual benefit and humanitarianism, and made a series of constructive recommendations relating to energy, finance, trade, food and development assistance. Our Government has been pleased with the broad support the report has received and with the increased public awareness fostered by the Work of the task force.\n64.\tParallel to the work of the Parliamentary task force, and based on it, the Canadian Government also conducted a review of NorthSouth policy. We have affirmed a number of fundamental issues, including a recognition of interdependence, the need for harmonization of external and domestic policies which have an impact on developing countries, the need to employ a variety of instruments to meet the needs of developing countries and greater integration of the South in the international economic system.\n[The speaker continued in French.]\n65.\tWe must as nations acknowledge the fact that our economic concerns, as well as many of our political, social and economic problems, are fundamentally international in nature. In an ever-changing world, the problem of the reconciliation of the fact of interdependence and the imperative need for self-determination is one of the greatest challenges facing political decision-makers. But our awareness of the complexities of interdependence and of its ramifications throughout all areas of national life must not lead us to despair, but rather to act. We must meet the challenge posed by the adaptation and development both of international institutional machinery and of our national ways of thinking to cope with those new realities and the need for change.\n66.\tWhatever means are used, the institutional machinery is inadequate. What is crucial is the will of all countries to make those instruments effective. Governments, whatever their national policies, must have the courage to tackle the major international problems of our day. In order to do so, they must feel confident that only through international cooperation can security, stability and justice for the world be guaranteed.\n67.\tCanadians have that confidence. We shall dedicate ourselves here and wherever these problems are considered to the quest for far-reaching international solutions which will affect the lives of every one of us.\n"

The audience that you have thereby gained is the best measure of your success in discharging the noble task entrusted to you.\n65.\tFor its part, my delegation would like to assure you of its full cooperation in helping you accomplish that task.\n66.\tI wish, at the same time, to express to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, our complete satisfaction and our appreciation for the skill with which he guided the work of the previous session.\n67.\tIt is also with great pleasure that I express to the SecretaryGeneral all my thanks and high esteem for the tireless and perspicacious efforts he has undertaken and continues to undertake in seeking to ensure the application of the resolutions of the Organization, the defense of its ideals and respect for its Charter.\n68.\tThe admission of two new independent States, Vanuatu and Belize, which we warmly welcome, is a precious contribution to the Organization and strengthens its universal character.\n69.\tOur current session opens in an atmosphere charged with worry and tensions. Regional conflicts are constantly extending, and their causes are increasing more and more.\nInternational problems and disputes are becoming ever more complex and are severely testing the Organization.\n70.\tThe agenda of the session contains problems full of specific threats to international stability and peace. Some of these problems are due to flagrant violations of the Charter and to disregard of international morality. Others are linked with lingering colonialism or its aftereffects, attacks on human dignity and human rights and the continuance of the policy of apartheid. Other tensions which threaten international peace and stability can be imputed to the growing gap between the prosperity of the developed countries and the continuing impoverishment of the majority of mankind, and also to the insane arms race and the stockpiling of arms.\n71.\tMorocco, which belongs to the Arab family, has always attached great importance to the problem of the Middle East and in particular gives a special place to the Palestinian question, because it is at the heart of the problem of the Middle East.\n72.\tThe Palestinian question constitutes a striking example of political injustice in the international arena, a clear illustration of Israel's disregard for the principles and ideals of humanity and a flagrant challenge to the resolutions adopted by the international community represented by the United Nations.\n73.\tAlthough the Organization has been seized of this question for more than 30 years, we must note that the Palestinian people continues to bear the full weight of the occupation by Israel, which is attempting to appropriate its land and its goods r \u2022 d is pursuing a policy aimed at obliterating the personality and changing the characteristics of the Palestinian homeland. We also note that the occupier is ceaselessly intensifying its policy of aggression perpetrated not only against the people and territory of Palestine, but also against neighboring Arab States, thus defying international public opinion and United Nations resolutions.\n74.\tDespite a radical evolution of the Palestinian question in the international arena, as illustrated by the recognition by the great majority of States of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State on its land, and by a growing international recognition of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, Israel is bent on pursuing its policy of aggression and the methodical colonial settlement of Palestine. Thus, Israel is pursuing a policy of exterminating the Palestinian people and seeks to distort Palestinian history, to destroy the religious and cultural institutions of the country, and to modify the demographic balance, seeking to eliminate Palestinian identity completely, with total disregard of international opinion and the United Nations.\n75.\tMorocco, which considers the question of Palestine as a priority item, reaffirms its commitment to give steadfast support to the struggling Palestinian people and to the other Arab States with territories that have been occupied since 1967. It reaffirms, moreover, its adherence to the resolutions adopted by Arab summit conferences, in particular those of the Seventh Arab Summit Conference held at Rabat in 1974 as well as those of the summits of Baghdad, Tunis and Amman. Any solution that does not include Israel's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, and that does not safeguard the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State in Palestine, remains unacceptable. We are firmly convinced that peace in the Middle East can be based only on a comprehensive and just solution.\n76.\t\\\"If the question of Palestine is a matter of high priority, the cause of the Holy City of Jerusalem is for us a sacred cause lying at the very heart of the Palestinian question. Morocco, whose sovereign, His Majesty King Hassan II, presides over the AlQuds Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, reaffirms in his own name and on behalf of the States of the Islamic community their total determination to defend the Arab and Islamic character of Jerusalem, to restore Arab sovereignty over the Holy City so that it will once again become what It has always been, a meeting place for believers of the three revealed religions, a center where tolerance and creative coexistence among the different religions will be restored.\n77.\tThe indignation that arose throughout the world following the decision of the Israeli Knesset to annex the city of AlQuds and to turn it into \\\"the eternal capital\\\" of the Zionist entity, and the unambiguous condemnation of that measure by the Security Council which, in its resolution 478 (1980), deemed it illegal and called for it to be rescinded, has none the less not prevented Israel from pursuing its outrageous policy of judaization of the Holy City.\n78.\tQuite on the contrary: Israel's defiance of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council has increased. Currently, the Israeli authorities are engaged in so-called archaeological work beneath and around the very foundations of the AiAqsa Mosque, and the Sacred Dome of the Rock, in flagrant violation of resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and UNESCO, which have firmly called upon Israel to refrain at once from such undertakings.\n79.\tThese criminal acts which, without any doubt, are designed to destroy the Islamic heritage of the Holy City, constitute another flagrant act of defiance of profound Islamic beliefs and international resolutions. The international community as a whole and, in particular, the United Nations, must adopt appropriate measures to put an end to this continued flagrant violation of international resolutions and conventions. The protection of Jerusalem is an international duty and all States of the world must contribute to it without hesitation.\n80.\tThis continued excavation by Israel represents a potential threat to international peace and security in the region, because the Islamic community, whose potential and energy is well known, will not long remain with folded arms faced with such a flagrant challenge to the symbols and sacred institutions of its faith.\n81.\tThe Israeli policy, based upon violence and aggression, is not carried out only against the Palestinian people in occupied Palestine, but extends its misdeeds into neighboring Arab States, Over the last few months, Israel has intensified its aggression against southern Lebanon, where it has destroyed towns and villages, killing or expelling the civilian population, in disregard of international opinion and morality. We have frequently expressed our total support for our brother country, Lebanon, and firmly condemned repeated Israeli acts of aggression perpetrated against its territory. We reiterate today our solidarity with the Lebanese Government in the defense of the independence, the national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Lebanon.\n82.\tMoreover, the unprovoked aggression perpetrated against Iraqi nuclear installations in Tamuz represented an additional demonstration of Israeli arrogance and systematic resort to the policy of force in violation of international instruments and conventions. The international disapproval expressed after those acts of aggression was illustrated by the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 487 (1981) which once again condemned the Israeli policy of aggression against Arab countries and reaffirmed the recognized right of Iraq to utilize nuclear energy to develop its national economy. In reiterating our condemnation of this aggression, I should like to emphasize its grave consequences for the international system established for the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and its consequences for international peace and security. We express the hope that the consideration of this question in the General Assembly will lead to the unreserved condemnation of Israeli aggression and the reaffirmation of Iraq's right to access to the technology necessary to its development.\n83.\tThe Organization has adopted many resolutions concerning the Palestinian question and the continued Israeli acts of aggression perpetrated against the Arab nation. It must now adopt the necessary measures to ensure the respect of these resolutions and their implementation. The Organization should not hesitate to have recourse to the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n84.\tIn January this year, the Third Islanac Summi Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference was held at MeccaTaif. During that historic Conference, the Islamic community expressed in the Mecca Declaration, on behalf of its sovereigns and Heads of State, its determination to work for the establishment of a just peace and harmony among peoples and to guarantee human rights, and decided to pursue. effort* in favor of the advent of a new era characterized by bi-national relations based on noble principles and not on the use of force, free from all forms of repression, exploitation and domination. On the same occasion, the Islamic community reaffirmed its commitment to combat Zionist aggression both in Palestine and in the other occupied Arab territories so as to mobilize all its energies to ensure the triumph of law and its restoration to those from which it has been confiscated.\n85.\tThe Arab community and the Islamic community have frequently reaffirmed during their summit conferences their will to achieve a peace based u]>on justice, while Israel has demonstrated by its acts that it does not seek peace but, rather* expansion and the acquisition of new territories. Events have continually demonstrated to the world that, unlike Israel, it is the Palestinians and the Arabs in general who aspire to security.\n86.\tThe initiative undertaken by His Royal Highness Eahd ibn Abdul Aziz, Crown Prince of the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia, has once more demonstrated Arab and Islamic determination to bring about a peace based upon justice. In fact, the point plan proposed by Prince Eahd takes into consideration the objective facts in the region and lays down principles which constitute a realistic platform to ensure the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. These principles take into consideration first of all, the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its territory, in accordance with law and justice as well as with resolutions .of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The MoroccoSaudi communique published at the beginning of September after the meeting between His Majesty King Hassan II and His Royal Highness Prince Fahd confirmed Morocco's full support for this Saudi initiative.\n87.\tThe artificial tension in northwest Africa was created and has been maintained for nearly six years by hegemonistic ambitions which make use of interference in the domestic affairs of other countries and encroachment on the territorial integrity of States.\n88.\tThe problem of what is called Western Sahara is nothing other, in fact, than the result of attempts to impair the territorial integrity of Morocco so as to create an artificial entity in its southern part, in violation of the principle of respect for the territorial integrity of States.\n89.\tThe dismemberment of the Moroccan State by the colonial Powers at the beginning of this century was a good illustration of the colonialist appetites which the African continent hap experienced, but of which Morocco was particularly a victim because of its strategic importance at the juncture of two continents, two seas and several civilizations. Morocco was thus progressively carved up by the colonial Powers which carved out for themselves different spheres of influence under the domination of various foreign Powers.\n90.\tSince the beginning of colonization, Morocco has tirelessly struggled to regain its independence and to achieve its territorial integrity. It was thus that it eliminated the French and Spanish protectorates in 1956; it then continued the struggle to liberate its other territories still under colonial domination.\n91.\tLater, in 1958, we regained the province of Tarfaya after negotiations with Spain. The Spanish authorities having shown reluctance and delay in returning the other Moroccan territories still under their domination, Morocco had recourse to the United Nations, which called for new negotiations with Spain. Those negotiations led to the return to Morocco in 1969 of the province of Ifni which, in fact and in law, was an integral part of what today is called Western Sahara.\n92.\tIn its efforts to liberate the parts of its territory still under Spanish domination, Morocco turned in 1974 to the International Court of Justice, which reaffirmed, in an advisory opinion of 16 October 19754 the permanent existence of legal links between the State of Morocco and the provinces of Western Sahara, as well as bonds of allegiance and Beia (fidelity) between, the Saharan population and the Kings of Morocco. Following that decision, the Green March was organized, making it possible for Morocco to recover the Saharan provinces, whose return to the mother country was welcomed with universal satisfaction by the Saharan population. Since then those people have frequently expressed their attachment to their Moroccan identity and their determination to continue it, thus following the example set by their ancestors over the centuries.\n93.\tThat devotion to the Moroccan homeland had already been demonstrated when the Saharan tribes rose up to protest the deportation by the colonials of His Majesty King Mohamed V and his family, thereby strikingly expressing their devotion to the father of the Moroccan nation.\n94.\tIt was again demonstrated when the inhabitants of the Sahara joined the liberation army in the north, in 1958, to expel colonial armed forces from the Sahara. It took the collusion of the colonial Powers, in the operation known as \\\"Ecouvillon\\\", to put an end to that resistance and to reestablish colonial domination over the Saharan part of Morocco.\n95.\tWhen the Moroccan people undertook their unifying march the Green March in 1975, the population of the Saharan provinces also undertook their own enthusiastic popular march to welcome their brothers from the north.\n96.\tThen on 26 February 1976 the unanimous vote of the Jamaa the representative council of all the tribes and populations of the Sahara came out in favor of the return of the Sahara to the motherland.\n97.\tIn the last five years, the inhabitants of the Saharan provinces have on several occasions had the opportunity to reaffirm their Moroccan identity through legislative, local and public service elections.\n98.\tMorocco's recovery of its Saharan provinces was, therefore, carried cut on the basis of international legality and responded to the aspirations of the populations involved.\n99.\tDespite the evidence of Morocco's rights over its Sahara, and despite our respect for international law, the enemies of our territorial integrity resorted to acts of violence and destruction, subjecting our country to acts of aggression commanded, organized and financed from abroad so as to create a situation of artificial tension in the region\n100.\tBut Morocco has never strayed from the path of wisdom and reason and has demonstrated cool-hardheadedness in order to avoid any escalation that might lead to open war with serious consequences for the whole of northwest Africa.\n101.\tThe OAU has made frequent attempts to find a reasonable solution which would put an end to the tension in our region. We all know that the OAU has narrowly avoided paying dearly for the blind policies pursued by those who persisted in maintaining this dangerous tension in northwest Africa. Maneuvers designed to force the OAU to take positions running counter to its charter and its principles nave nearly led to its breakup. Morocco had always considered that the African organization had to be given all necessary latitude to resolve this conflict as it was the most qualified indeed, the only organization able to grasp the facts and their implications. In the framework of the OAU, Morocco's contribution to the search for a solution to this crisis has always been constructive and untiring. The idea of forming the Committee of Wise Men in order to follow the development of the crisis and to reach a definitive settlement was the initiative of Morocco, which presented it to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization.of African Unity at its fifteenth ordinary session, held at Khartoum in July 1978. The OAU at once approved that initiative.\n102.\tWhen the conditions necessary for the solution of the problem had been established, at the OAU Assembly at Freetown in 1980, His Majesty King Hassan II went to the Nairobi Assembly last June to announce Morocco's initiative of organizing a supervised referendum in the Sahara so as to give the population of the territory another opportunity to express their choice, in full freedom, with regard to their attachment to their Moroccan identity.\n103.\tMorocco, which took that initiative fully convinced of the legitimacy of its rights over its recovered provinces, made that gesture to meet the wishes of a number of friendly States which regard the proposed referendum as the best way out of the crisis in the region. His Majesty King Hassan II stated on 26 June 1981 at Nairobi:\n\\\"Therefore, because we desire with the full force of our will to save our African community from that which might threaten its breakup and dissolution, because we have tirelessly desired to preserve the OAU's world image as a coherent, aware and responsible organization, we have decided to consider a supervised referendum, whose mechanisms will be in accordance both with the recommendations of the ad hoc committee the Committee of Wise Men and with Morocco's belief in its legitimate rights. . . .\n\\\"By deciding to turn to the solution of holding a referendum which is highly esteemed in Africa, and which was advocated by the Wise Men, we are first and foremost responding to the request made of us by many friendly African, Arab and European Heads of State.\\\"\n104.\tWe consider that because of its experience and its knowhow the United Nations could contribute to the proper holding of that referendum.\n105.\tThe Implementation Committee on Western Sahara that was set up by the Nairobi Assembly held preliminary meetings from 24 to 2o ^August and laid down the stages for the implementation of the decision to hold a referendum. We announced our willingness to cooperate fully with the OAU and its Implementation Committee by making available to them all the facilities necessary for the holding of the referendum.\n106.\tIn a letter addressed a few days ago to Mr. Daniel Arap Moi, President of the Republic of Kenya and current President of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, King Hassan II stated:\n\\\"As we assured the Committee, we shall spare no effort to facilitate, in the context of Moroccan sovereignty, the holding of the proposed consultation, which should herald the return of peace to the Western Saharan region.\n\\\"In particular, the Moroccan authorities will provide all assistance necessary for the impartial organization of the referendum envisaged in the pertinent paragraphs of the resolution. In this connection, we shall give appropriate instructions to the civilian and military authorities with whom the interim administration is to cooperate.\\\"\n107.\tIn view of the resolution that was adopted at Nairobi on Western Sahara, logic, legal considerations and wisdom all require that those States which previously held a position conflicting with that resolution, in that they recognized a nonexistent entity, should withdraw that recognition in conformity with the spirit of that African resolution.\n108.\tIn this connection Morocco hopes that the United Nations will join in this peacemaking effort on the part of Africa by endorsing the African resolution, which, we hope, will make it possible for security, peace and tranquility to return to the Arab Maghreb and will usher in a new era based on cooperation and brotherhood and directed towards progress.\n109.\tThe African continent remains the theater of antagonisms and struggles for political influence which seriously imperil its stability and threaten its economic and social development. Our African continent, however, is determined to oppose any attempts at hegemony or seizure of its wealth, while remaining open to fruitful cooperation and equitable dialog, with due respect for its special characteristics.\n110.\tIn southern Africa, the Namibian people continues its admirable and heroic struggle to free itself of South African colonial occupation. The manifold actions undertaken by the United Nations in order to bring about Namibian independence have been thwarted by the maneuvers and procrastinations of the Pretoria regime, which has given no genuine sign of accepting Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and was responsible for the failure of the Geneva pre-implementation meeting.\n111.\tMy delegation commends the struggle of the fraternal Namibian people and would like to assure it of Morocco's support in its fight for total independence and territorial integrity. We would request the United Nations to take all the energetic measures possible without delay to enable that people to accede to independence and sovereignty.\n112.\tThe unprovoked aggressions which have been visited upon the territory of Angola by the troops of South Africa have given a new dimension to the struggle for Namibian independence. Those aggressions, which my delegation vigorously condemns, jeopardize the sovereignty of a member State of the OAU and through their repercussions may well further exacerbate the already tense situation prevailing in that part of our continent.\n113.\tAt a time when the world is becoming more and more aware of the need to respect the rights and dignity of all human beings in all latitudes, we have seen that the racist regime of Pretoria is entrenched ii> its policy of apartheid and collective repression of the people of South Africa.\n114.\tThe effective support which that regime continues to receive undoubtedly enables it to continue a policy that affronts human dignity and violates all the principles of international morality.\n115.\tWe shall never cease to call on those who continue to help the South African regime economically and militarily to apply the decisions of the United Nations and immediately put an end to their collusion with the racist regime of Pretoria.\n116.\tIn Western Asia, the Moslem people of Afghanistan has for almost two years now been prey to foreign military occupation.\n117.\tMorocco, whose concern it is to preserve the links of friendship and cooperation that have been forged with the Soviet Union, and which, with the rest of the Moslem world, shares responsibility for defending the heritage and the ideals of Islam, is in duty bound to reaffirm its support for the Afghan people and to assure it of its complete solidarity, in the context of the Islamic Conference and other international institutions, the first of which is the United Nations, in seeking a solution that will guarantee the Afghan people the right to choose the sort of regime it desires and also will guarantee its identity as an Islamic people and its status as a nonaligned country.\n118.\tLike the rest of the international community, the Islamic world is deeply disquieted by the destructive war, which has lasted for more than one year now, between two neighboring Islamic States, Iraq and Iran. My country, which gave its full support to the resolution of the Islamic Conference calling for a ceasefire and the start of constructive dialog between the two countries, once again expresses its hope that peace will be restored between the two neighboring States, a peace based on respect for the principles of State sovereignty, noninterference in internal affairs and the rules of good-neighborliness, while at the same time guaranteeing the historic rights of Iraq over its territorial waters and national territory.\n119.\tAs far as Democratic Kampuchea is concerned, Morocco believes that every measure should be taken to ensure the implementation of the Declaration and the resolution adopted by the International Conference on Kampuchea which met in New York in July 1981.5\n120.\tIn the Mediterranean region, Morocco has devoted itself for several years now to devising and establishing, with all the countries that border that sea, the foundations for the type of cooperation that will assure all coastal States of permanent security and prosperity. We arc today deeply concerned by the ugly clouds of tension that can be described there.\n121.\tBecause of its geographic location and the strategic position that it occupies, Morocco is fully alive to the particular responsibilities it bears in seeking conditions guaranteeing the security of that sea, especially in the Strait of Gibraltar.\n122.\tThat is why we declare our readiness to join in the efforts of all those coastal countries which wish to turn the Mediterranean into a zone of peace and security.\n123.\tIn this connection, we are very pleased that the work of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe will shortly be resumed, and we are anxious that our own concerns be set forth there and, as far as possible, heeded, particularly with respect to the Mediterranean where we are seriously concerned.\n124.\tMorocco, which is pleased with the good relationships which it has with all the countries on the northern coast, would like to emphasize the particular ties that we have with one of those countries, because of a certain historical closeness. The positions which are occupied by Morocco and Spain both in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic call for even more trusting and fruitful cooperation between the two countries' But we must, on both sides, be aware that that sort of cooperation, if it is to develop further, must be protected from certain vicissitudes which have been inherited from the remote past. I am referring to the enclaves of Ceuta and Mellila and the surrounding islands, in connection with which Morocco, my country, cannot give up its rights to sovereignty. Morocco remains wedded to the idea of seeking a frank and free exchange of views on that point in order to remove the aftereffects of the past, which have been rejected by the international community and which Spain itself has constantly condemned when it has claimed, from this very rostrum, the rightful return of Gibraltar to Spanish national sovereignty.\n125.\tInternational public opinion is demanding with increasing assertiveness that conditions be brought about that will make detente possible in international relations, and will ensure peace and guarantee international security. We note with some distress that the few results that were achieved by that tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, have had no impact on the headlong race to develop all types of armaments.\n126.\tThe continuance of nuclear tests, apart from violating the nonproliferation regime, indicates the absence of any political will on the part of the main nuclear Powers to conclude a treaty prohibiting such tests.\n127.\tThe unprecedented accumulation of the means of waging war is undoubtedly not likely to preserve peace. It is regrettable that the great Powers have been indulging for more than four decades now in a rivalry in which considerable effort has been devoted to armaments research.\n128.\tInstead of giving rise to an atmosphere of security and hope, scientific and technological progress only leads to anxiety and distress.\n129.\tMorocco, which has always been a staunch supporter of disarmament, both internationally and regionally, hopes that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament which is to be held next year will tackle this problem in a determined fashion and lead to the conclusion of international conventions, particularly in the fields of nuclear testing and of chemical weapons.\n130.\tInternational relations, which are marked in general by uncertainty and the state of the world economy, continue to deteriorate.\n131.\tThis situation has a particularly alarming effect on the developing countries. Their growing indebtedness, which in 1980 reached the intolerable level of $450 billion, their persistent dependence on others for food and the deterioration in their terms of trade have created phenomena which' hamper their development and threaten their political stability.\n132.\tInternational economic institutions and various conferences have taken up the situation and have recognized that there is a need to examine the world economic order. Partial and unilateral solutions are merely expedients and in fact hold up the application of a remedy that will have more lasting results. Faced with economic injustice, the appeals of the third world have met with a total lack of political will on the part of their interlocutors, who obstinately reject equitable solutions. Indeed, the most developed countries are stepping up their protectionist policies, reducing their foreign aid and adopting measures which have a negative impact on growth and employment in the developing countries.\n133.\tThe hesitancy which has been shown by certain developed countries with respect to the rather moderate goals of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, which was initiated this year, has increased our fears, particularly since the Second United Nations Development. Decade was a total failure.\n134.\tThe United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi in August 1981, did agree on a program of action, but this may well remain simply a pious wish if there are no specific financial commitments. More recently, the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris in September 1981, simply took a few first-aid measures, with no precise timetable for their implementation.\n135.\tThat series of deadlocks in partial and sectoral negotiations makes it even more essential that the global negotiations which have been demanded by the countries of the third world be started. Those negotiations should result in genuine international cooperation and the effective implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third Decade. The forthcoming International Meeting on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries at Cancun should be the occasion for a frank and, we hope, fruitful exchange of thinking that will help to remove the obstacles preventing the initiation of global negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations.\n136.\tAlthough the same reasons for concern are always encountered at each of these sessions, it is nevertheless heartening to see that every year the Assembly echoes with voices that are almost unanimous in their desire for friendship and cooperation among peoples and for peace in the world. Our sincere wish is to contribute to this in the best way we can, and it is our undying hope that an era of harmony and prosperity will dawn to the benefit of mankind as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "20.\t Sir, on behalf of the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, it is my great pleasure to express to you our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the. thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Beyond a shadow.of a doubt, your election proves that you are a diplomat of great moral and intellectual qualities, one who has dedicated himself as the representative of his country and as an international civil servant to the ideals of the United Nations. It is also a tribute to our Arab nation for its irreplaceable contribution to the elaboration of the fundamental principles of justice and equality which govern mankind and for the role it played in the forefront of the struggle of peoples for their political independence and the.role it will play in the struggle for their future economic independence.\n21.\tI should also like to express to your predecessor, Mr Rodiger von Wechmar, our appreciation for the way in which he conducted the proceedings of the thirty-fifth session. We were very much impressed with the vision and moral integrity of this great diplomat who became a president representing all the currents that disturb the world.\n22.\tFinally, I should like to thank the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in difficult circumstances in the service of the Organization. We should like to express our great appreciation to him.\n23.\tOur delegation would like to join with all others in welcoming the new States of Vanuatu and Belize to the United Nations, Our country hopes that other countries which have been deprived of their sacred right to national sovereignty will soon be liberated, thereby bringing the Organization closer to its goal of universality and ensuring the full implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).\n24.\tWe should have liked today to display optimism. We should In particular have liked to speak of spectacular progress or even of a few timid, tentative steps by the international community towards the strengthening <of international security, the liberation of peoples and the start of a new, more just international economic order. Unfortunately, the net results since the thirty-fifth session have been disappointing. Indeed, we must note with some bitterness that there has definitely been retrogression in those areas, which are so vital for the future of mankind.\n25.\tToday the general picture of international relations is very gloomy: there is violence and aggression In Africa, in the Middle East and in South-East Asia; negotiations on the law of the sea have been blocked in their final stage; and there are indications of failure in the global negotiations. The most typical example of this general deterioration in the international situation is to be found in economic relations. There the difficulties which the economies of the developed countries have had to grapple with for a number of years now have considerably increased the growth problems cf the developing countries, thereby accentuating the world economic crisis, which was already very serious. ' \u25a0 \u25a0 \u2022>\n26.\tAn even more disturbing phenomenon is that for the first year of the Third United Nations Development Decade, it is estimated that the growth in per capita income will be less than one third of the international community's goal.\n27.\tIf that situation weighs particularly heavily on the economies of the developing countries, it is simply disastrous for the poorest of those countries. Inflation, which strikes at the world economy as a whole, has made a negative contribution to this phenomenon and the consequences for the poorest countries have therefore been more severe. The decline in trade among the developed, market-economy countries has had harmful and immediate repercussions on the developing countries. Official United Nations statistics leave no room for doubt on that score.\n28. One can easily imagine the consequences.of this situation for the balance of payments of a large number of developing countries and for their ability to service their accumulated debts. Furthermore, the protectionist mends wont have emerged over the past few years have accelerated to a degree without precedent in the history of North-South relations. If these trends are not reversed, it is to be feared that most of the developing countries no> only will not achieve the objectives of the International Development Strategy but will be confronted by even more serious economic and social problems.\n29. As a country that is both Sahelian and Saharan, essentially involved in agricultural and pastoral activities, from which 80 per cent of its population derive their living, my country pays special attention to developments in\nagriculture, an essential part of the world economy. We therefore follow the work of various United Notions bodies dealing with matters in that field and take put in it the occasion arises.\n30.\tIn an increasingly unfavorable international environment, we shall, no matter what, continue our efforts to establish a policy of self-sufficiency in agriculture by encouraging our people to produce more and by introducing procedures that can limit agricultural losses and modernize our means of production. Thus, over the past few months, missions made up of officials at the highest level have undertaken a campaign to increase the awareness of the need to increase agricultural production, in particular that of foodstuffs. The favorable reaction of the people augurs well for the results of that campaign, but the needs are still great, and the financial and technical means to satisfy them are practically non-existent.\n31.\tWe do not underestimate the importance or volume of the international assistance that has been given to us so fat and I wish to thank all those who at one time or another have helped us. But as FA0 has stated and I wish to thank its officials for their invaluable assistance the food situation in the 26 African countries covered by the Global Information and Early Warning System for Food and Agriculture remains disturbing. The situation is particularly difficult in the Sahelian countries, where the after-effects of drought continue to mortgage heavily the economic and social future of the area.\n32.\tThe question of assistance to meet particular circumstances Is still relegated to the background in favor of aid in the area of structural changes that must be made in the economies of those countries. The building of roads, ports and warehouses, the training, of technicians and so forth are needs which the particularly acute.\n33.\tThe current Chairman of the Permanent Interstate Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel ICILSS], General Moussa Tvaorf, President of the sister Republic of Mali, eloquently analyzed before the Assembly on 2 October [23rd meeting] the development problems of the countries of CILSS. We completely subscribe to that analysis. As an example of regional co-operation and a sincere expression of the will for the economic integration of the countries concerned, CILSS must continue to enjoy the intemnHiymi community's financial and technical support. \tIn this connection, a special debt of gratitude is owed to the Secretary-General and to the administration of UNDP, which is in charge of the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office. We welcome the relations we have had with that body, which we hope will be further strengthened as the years go by.\n35.\tFUrthermore, my country, whose delegation had the honor of introducing the draft resolution concerning the observance of World Food Day at the Assembly's thirty-fifth session, welcomes the fact that the General Assembly will be devoting a special meeting to that subject this year. We mist that this event will lead to a greater awareness of the threats of hunger, undernourishment and malnutrition throughout the world.\n36: In the area of industrialization, another driving force for economic growth, the performances of the developing countries do not encourage optimism.'The Lima Plan of Action on Industrial Development and ; Cooperation, modest as it Is, seems unlikely to be attained. However, we hope that UNIDO, once it has become a specialized agency, , will be able to make a greater contribution to the efforts of the developing countries in this-area.\n37.-The energy problem has become even more acute since the crisis of 1973-1974. The threat of a general conflict looming over the international community has finally convinced it that any just and lasting solution must be accepted by all States, weather they are producers or consumers of energy.\n38.\tThe United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi, has crystallized this approach by adopting the Nairobi program of Action.4 Despite the momentum given to the action of the international community in its effort to work out a global solution to the energy problem, we regret that that meeting did not reach agreement on such fundamental points as the institutional machinery and the appropriate measures to ensure the additional transfer of the financial resources needed, for full implementation of the program of Action.\n39.\tAnother conference, the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, was just held in Paris. Mauritania, with a full understanding of the difficulties being encountered by those countries although not officially grouped with them played an active part in the work of that Conference. In this connection, we welcome in particular the fact that the level of representation was high enough to make it possible for specific commitments to be entered into and action-oriented decisions to be adopted. We are confident that the representatives that attended the conference will, individually, see to it that the measures decided on are implemented, both those having to do with international support and those related, to implementation, Mow-up actton and supervision.' ; ^ \u25a0'\n40.\tAs I have already stated, according to the criteria applied by the United Nations which should,' incidentally, be reviewed in the light of the increasingly difficult economic situation of many countries, my own included\u2014Mauritania Is not among the 31 least developed countries. Nevertheless, we-continue to be faced with the. same problems as those countries.\n41.\tIn spite of General Assembly resolution 3054 (XXVIII) associating the countries of the Sahellan region with the least developed countries because of the drought with which they were stricken, we believe that nothing contained in the Substantial New program of Action-for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted by the Paris Conference' should be interpreted as signifying that the assistance to be given to the 31 countries identified by the United Nations should be at the expense of other recipient countries.\n42.\tThis is an appropriate opportunity to congratulate the French Government for the praiseworthy intentions it voiced at that Conference. Such intentions reflect France's new and welcome general arrangements in approaching\nthe complex political and economic problems facing the Third World.\n43.\tOn .the other hand, we, wonder, whether the Lagos Plan of Action,' which is a veritable manual for development for the African continent in , the coming decade, can be implemented according to the proposed timetable, or whether it will remain merely an expression of pious hopes.\n44.\tWe must also wonder whether the Caracas program of Action [see A/36/339], the first specific attempt to institutionalize a true South-South co-operation, will be provided with the means necessary for its implementation. '..'.'''.\n45.\tHere again, everything will depend upon the political will of States. The launching of global negotiations and the conclusion of an agreement on the law of the sea have clearly shown that that cannot always be counted on. After a year of continuous efforts under the excellent guidance of the previous President, it has not-been possible to reach a consensus on ways of launching such global negotiations.\n46.\tA year ago, from this rostrum, we made an urgent appeal to certain countries who have since then, admittedly, adopted a much more flexible position to join in the international consensus in a spirit of solidarity, though with due regard to foreign interests.. ...\n47.\tNow we are looking to Cancun, where in a few days a number of leaders from both developed and developing countries will meet. This is the last chance for the developed countries to regain the trust of the third world, and that meeting should open the way for solid and detailed negotiations within the framework of the United Nations.\n48.. With regard to negotiations on the law of the sea, we hope that , the result of the great efforts made in that area over the past ten years will make it possible to demonstrate the good will of the technologically advanced countries. It is above all to be hoped that the fundamental elements of the draft convention will not be brought into question and that can be signed next year as planned.\n49.\t' The frustrations of most of the nations of the third world over the outcome of various negotiations and the implementation of programs designed to lead to more equitable world economic relations are clearly reflected in the political area. Here again, our community of nations is far from having fulfilled the promise contained in the Charter to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\".\n50.\tIn the Middle East, the Camp David accords have been seen in their true light. More than ever, they appear to be a way of strengthening the Zionist entity in its refusal to recognize the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine or to liberate the other occupied Arab territories.\n51.\tThere have been no positive developments with regard to the question of Palestine. What is worse, certain\nnegative development have occurred because of Israel's Increasingly warlike attitude, one that has dangerously and superfluously complicated an. already highly explosive situation.\n52.\tThe Israeli acts of aggression the Assembly is aware of them have indeed Increased against fraternal Lebanon and have extended to populated areas through reckless campaigns of collective reprisals that remind us unmistakably of the Nazi atrocities against the Warsaw ghetto and in other European cities during the Second World Wat\n53.\tIn this connection, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania reaffirms its solidarity and sympathy with the fraternal people of Lebanon. We also reaffirm our Country's attachment to the unity of the Lebanese people, the Integrity of their national territory and their aspirations within the framework of the national objectives shared by the entire Arab nation.\n54.\tIn the same theater of operations and with unparalleled arrogance, the Zionist entity, assuming its self-appointed role of policeman of the area, has begun a campaign of intimidation and preparations for aggression against Syria, threatening the world with.a new and serious Israeli-Arab aimed conflict.\n55.\tHowever beyond Palestine and its immediate neighbors, Israel has arrogantly and cynically bombed the atomic reactors at Tamuz, near Baghdad, which were for scientific purposes. We take this opportunity to express our indignant condemnation of that Infamous act, the purpose of. which has not escaped the attention of our community of nations. It was Israel's intention to hold back all scientific progress among the Arab peoples in a vain attempt to perpetuate its supremacy. We must emphasize that this action was taken in defiance of the rules laid down by IAEA for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy under tntftmHtinpal control.\n56. Obviously, neither muscle-flexing nor racist aggression against the Arab history of Palestine and the aspirations of its people, much less furious attacks on the technological future of the Arab people, will move us forward towards peace. On the contrary, we believe, along with the majority of Member States, that Israel must respect the universal consensus recognizing the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the Palestinian people and calling for the return of the other occupied Arab territories and art end to State terrorism if it really wants to create a climate conducive to cKtente, then to a genuine, just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We reiterate opposition on this subject.\n57.\tFirst, we call for Israel's total and unconditional withdrawal from all territories occupied as a result of the June 1967 aggression, particularly the Holy City of Al Quds.\n58.\tSecondly, the international community must compel the usurper fully to restore to the Palestinian Arab people its inalienable rights, including its imprescriptible right to create its own independent State in the land of its ancestors.\n\u00abT\n59.\tThirdly, there is an overriding, obligation fully and completely to bring the P1A sole,, representative of the Palestinian Arab people, into any genuine settlement. Here we reaffirm our opposition to all partial settlements, especially the Camp David agreements.\t-\n60.\tFourthly, my country considers null and void all attempts by the occupying Power to modify the demographic composition, the environment and the Arab, Moslem and Christian nature of Palestinian lands and other occupied territories by the creation of. settlements, the digging of a canal from the Dead Sea, or by other means.\t-\n61.\tFifthly, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania vigorously condemns the excavations undertaken by the Zionist authorities in Al Quds. To our mind, this act of sacrilege is a provocation of the Islamic community in a place which is holy and dear to all revealed religions.\n62.\tHaving reaffirmed our position, we take this opportunity to salute the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and its chairman, our brother, Mr. Sarrd, for their tireless efforts to bring about the triumph of the just cause of the Palestinians and of genuine peace in the Middle East.\n63.\tStill on the subject of the Middle East, my delegation cannot but express its concern over, the strategic alliance signed between the United States of America and Israel during Begin's last visit to Washington. The Islamic .Republic of Mauritania sincerely hopes that the United States, which in spite of everything must remain a friend of the Arab world, will not take this stance, which has unpredictable consequences and which is in any event not In keeping with the many Interests of a great nation which takes on world-wide responsibilities.\n64.\tIn another brother country, Namibia, a process similar to that which the peoples of the Arab East feel in body and soul is going on with the same arrogance and the same scorn for repeated United Nations resolutions.\n65.\tThe minority racist Government of South Africa, arrogating to Itself a mandate that was revoked 15 years ago by the Organization, is perpetuating its political domination of Namibia, a country whose natural resources it abusively exploits, and is preparing to dismember it by inciting antagonism among its inhabitants.\n66.\tWe remind the Assembly of Africa's patience and the sense of responsibility and wisdom of the South West Africa People's Organization (SHAPO), to. which South Africa replies with diversionary and other delaying tactics. My delegation will limit itself today to recalling Its position on this subject, a position which is that of the whole of Africa, an Africa determined to ensure the final and unconditional liberation of Namibia.\n67.\tFirst, we reaffirm the attachment of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania to Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We consider that it is the sole minimum basis for the success of a peaceful settlement process for the crisis. Along with united Africa, we accept no attempt to modify that resolution and no maneuver aimed at delaying its implementation. We reject in particular the specious argument, for prolonging the Calvary of the majority of the 'Namibian people on the pretext of preserving the interests ,of the European minority.\n68. < While we have respect and consideration for all the - inhabitants of Namibia, we believe that the best guarantee is the rapid Implementation of the plan which has been i proposed. We appeal again to the five Western countries of the contact group to join with us in bringing about the 'triumph of a just solution which would preserve calm relations between the communities and the ties of friendship that exist between the West and the whole of. our continent.\n69.\tThis is the time for our delegation to congratulate the front-line States of Africa for their sense of. solidarity among the peoples of our continent. We also salute the United Nations Council for Namibia and its president for helping to make clear the anachronistic situation in that country, Finally, we salute SWAPO and the Namibian people. SWAPO has unceasingly stood in the vanguard of . that people's struggle and has been identified closely both will).its suffering and with its great victories.\n70.\tJust as in Palestine, where the occupation of the whole territory of the Mandate no longer satisfied Zionism in its warlike adventures, apartheid is expanding the field of its activities which jeopardize the peace and security of the world. In the past Mozambique has been the favorite target of its criminal invasions, and it no doubt will continue to be so in the future. Today Angola is subjected to a series of violations of its sovereignty, with expeditions whose true elm is the destabilization of the country and the isolation of the Namibian people; these will no doubt continue in the future. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania reiterates its full and unswerving support for Angola.\n71.\tBut the minority racist regime of South Africa does not stop there in its general work of hatred and discrimination. Israel may have imposed a foreign exile, on the Palestinians, but Pretoria is skilfully ensuring the internal exile of the Indigenous peoples of South Africa. The iniquitous laws against blacks and other minorities are endless; racist violence and terrorism by the authorities has become part of the everyday lives of the peoples of South Africa, but racist violence and harassment are ever more frequently encountering, this year in particular; the organized opposition of South African patriots under the leadership of the African National Congress. We renew our expressions of fraternal solidarity with the peoples of South Africa and their vanguard.\n72.\tPalestine and southern Africa have the, unfortunate privilege of having been the battlefields of long and bard struggles by peoples against racist colonial settlers, but in many other regions of the world other men are suffering and dying.\n73.\tThe war between two brother countries, Iraq and Iran, has been going on for mote than a year and continues, unfortunately, with its attendant woes. This cruel conflict goes on in spite of the long fraternal coexistence of two peoples which are united by so many bonds of history and religion. We once again urge our Iraqi and Iranian brethren to end their ruinous, deadly confrontation and to reach a just, peaceful and final solution to their territorial dispute. We call on them in particular to respond more responsibly and with greater good will to tho untiring efforts and good offices of both the 'Organization ' 'of the Islamic Conference and the non-aligned countries, : In this connection we note Iraq estated willingness, to cooperate with these good offices.\n74.'\tThe unjustified bombing of Kuwaiti economic installations  a consequence of the deplorable conflict in the Gulf region, is, to our mind, inadmissible. That extension of the hostilities to a third country, if it were to be repeated, could cause a serious deterioration, in the relations among the countries of the region.\n75.\tThe fraternal people of Afghanistan are subjected tn pointless trials which have gone on far too long. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania,, without interfering in the internal affairs of the sister Afghan nation, which Is bound to us by civilization and faith, believes that it is for that people alone to settle its notional disputes, showing respect for its historic traditions, and without outside interference.\n76.\tWith respect to Kampuchea, our country has always adopted an unequivocal attitude on the situation that was created in that country in 1979. In particular, at the International Conference on Kampuchea last July we appealed to socialist Viet Nam, which so admirably symbolizes so many of our ideals and whose contribution to the liberation of peoples has been invaluable. We requested It to respond to the profound wishes of the peoples of Indochina and of the world and to co-operate in the search for - a negotiated political settlement of the crisis. We welcome the increased harmonization- of the patriotic forces of Kampuchea and reaffirm our support for General Assembly resolutions 34/22 and 35/6.\n77.\tAs in the case of Afghanistan, our delegation firmly believes that the essential condition for the restoration of national sovereignty and the maintenance of the integrity and freedom of expression of the Khmer people, is that . there be no foreign Intervention.\n78.\tGenerally speaking, and as we stated in the general debate at the thirty-fifth session.of the Assembly [33rd meeting], vie strongly condemn the right assumed by some States, large and small, to change by force the political system of any country they may unilaterally consider to be hostile. -\n79.\tIn Western Sahara, the fratricidal war between the POLI3ARIO Front' and Morocco has now entered, at the diplomatic level, a settlement process led by the Organization of African Unity ,[OW]. The settlement plan which the Implementation Committee outlined in broad terms at Its recent meeting at Nairobi has the advantage of ,setting out the practical modalities for a referendum through which the Sahraoui people would determine its future, in accordance with .the repeated resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU.\n80.\tWe hope that that referendum will take place smoothly, under international control and as soon as possible, so as to put an end to the many sacrifices of our Sahraoui and Moroccan brothers. We especially hope that both parties to the conflict, Morocco and the POL1SARIO Front, can maintain contact so as to bring about a speedy cease-fire which is necessary for the restoration of mutual confidence.\n81.\tWe call on the United Nations to encourage the initiative ' by Africa and its implementation Committee which, in our opinion, will speedily accomplish its difficult task and show firmness in ensuring that the consultation takes place in the best conditions of equity that will ensure the free expression of the will of the Saliraoui people without military or administrative pressure from any quarter.\n82.\tIn particular, we appeal to the United Nations to put its experience and its human and material means at the disposal of the QAU in the preparation, organization and supervision of the referendum.\n83.\tOur country is now definitely out of the conflict and is willing to cooperate fully with the Implementation Committee to bring about a just solution of the problem of Western Sahara and a return of the Arab Maghreb to fruitful co-operation and peaceful and brotherly coexistence among its peoples.\n84.\tAlongside those conflicts which are certainly devastating but localized, we see at the international level an arms race which threatens all continents and all peoples. The conventional and nuclear arms race consumes incalculable sums which, could be used to bring relief to millions of human beings whose means of existence are below, the minimum acceptable level.\n85.\t' At the special session next spring our delegation will deal in detail with that important and delicate problem. Today I should merely like to make special mention of the build-up of nuclear arsenals and the steadily increasing sophistication in that area.\n86.\tThe. Islamic Republic of Mauritania would like in particular to reaffirm its interest in the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the whole of the African continent and in the Middle East. But in Africa and the Arab world wc see that South Africa and Israel, which ignore international norms and principles, are building nuclear arsenals in order to intimidate their Arab and African neighbors.\n87.\tWith the entry of Vanuatu and Belize, whose admission to the United Nations I have just welcomed, the United Nations is approaching its goal of universality. The world is no longer that of 1945.\n88.\tWith the new political order, in which large and small nations now have the same rights of theoretical sovereignty, the realities of our contemporary world make necessary a new information order and, even mote. Important, a new economic order.\t'\n89.\tThat new information order will not put an end to some of the greatest achievements of mankind, that is, freedom of thought and the sacred right to express it. In our opinion, there cannot be happy societies when creativity, ingenuity and men's philosophical and political beliefs arc subjected to constraints and taboos. But the conquests that permit man the full enjoyment of his wholeness as a person must extend to aU his needs.\n90.\tAcquired rights must not be sacrificed. We must not forget the concerns of man in advanced technological societies. But and this is just as important in our eyes some place must be given to the simple, absorbing, noble and beautiful preoccupations of that other man of the second large and needy part of the great human family, That is the beginning of the reordering of the, relations which govern mankind.\t' '\n91.\tThe aim of the United Nations in the minds cf its eminent founders, would always be to establish the equality of nations, great and small. The information order will be the first step towards establishing a true new world order for civilization in which mankind will be inspired by all (lie moral values of all men. In that way we shall reject any exclusive monopoly of orientation or polarization concerning the problems and needs of one human family, and ethics alone will prevail.\n92.\tFor its part, the new economic order should, mainly through the global negotiations and those relating to the law of the sea, ensure the necessary rectification of the economic relations between the North and the South. Thus, the abnormalities of the colonial order and the structural imbalances which ensued as a result of the technological domination of a single continent will be corrected.\n93.\tPeace and security in the world can only be achieved by a serious study and reform leading to more equity and realism in relations which should truly mirror the present-day world. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania will participate to the best of its ability in that reorganization within the framework of its devotion to its moral values and to its age-old civilization, of which it is deeply and legitimately proud. Our country will do this in keeping with its Arab and African national identity and with its objective solidarity with the peoples of the third world. But, at the same time, our country will fight that battle in full awareness of the fact that it is part of the human family, which, in spite of race, religion and continent, is one and must remain one.\n"

        "file_text": "The time honored practice of congratulating the President of the General Assembly and expressing great satisfaction at his election is in this instance easy to do, for the Assembly is presided over by a most distinguished person, the representative of Iraq, a country with which Spain has enjoyed and continues to enjoy close relations.\n200.\tI must also thank Mr. von Wechmar for the skill and effectiveness with which he conducted the business of the last session of the General Assembly, thanks to his personal attributes and those of his country.\n201.\tMy gratitude goes also to the Secretary-General, who directs the work of the Secretariat so skilfully, so appropriately and with such tenacity, giving it the necessary stimulus.\n202.\tI wish too to welcome Vanuatu, a new Member whose admission will strengthen the universality of the Organization.\n203.\tIt is with satisfaction that we see that the State of Belize will soon join us. We share the most ancient historical roots with Belize, and we wish it in its independence a prosperous peace in union with its neighbors.\n204.\tIn order to establish the Spanish position before the Assembly I must base myself on two tenets of analysis and action. One is the unequivocal option of Spain in favor of a EuroWestern political concept, certain that the pluralistic democratic system, which is its ethical reference, has greater social flexibility and a greater capacity for adaptation to the needs and requirements of peoples. This is an indivisible process, both in the Field of convictions and in the practical field of their internal and international institutionalization. The Spanish State is ready to accept the consequences thereof.\n205.\tAs I said last year, the form our democracy has chosen to take to exercise the right to defend the maintenance of international peace and security as an inherently Spanish decision does not allow of any interference without serious infringement of the fundamental rules of international law and the very principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n206.\tWe are sure that the Members of the United Nations, with all of which we wish to have peaceful and cordial relations, will not attempt any interference which would be intolerable or any confused and baseless conjectures. Spain is not, nor does it wish to be, a threat to anyone. On the contrary, in any forum in which it participates it will maintain a constant position of striving for real peace.\n207.\tThe second tenet concerns credibility. In this regard Spain has in the United Nations shown undeniable consistency, as is easily verifiable. On the questions of the Middle Bast, Lebanon and Palestine, the Sahara, apartheid, Namibia, human rights, terrorism, the battle against racial discrimination and intolerance, peacekeeping operations, the crises of Afghanistan and Kampuchea and the Cypriot conflict, and on matters of disarmament and development, the attitude of the Spanish democracy has remained constant.\n208.\tIn these difficult times, in which peace is precarious, Spain has responded from positions of principle, has entirely resisted the pressures coming from interested parties and has clung to an independent foreign policy conditional only upon the interests of the Spanish people and the desire for cooperation in establishing a mote just and harmonious international order.\n209.\tSpecial and immediate reference must be made to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which after 10 months has postponed its Madrid meeting until next October. Spain has a dual role as host and participant. As host, we are ready to receive the Conference in Madrid with the same satisfaction as before. As one of the 35 participating States, we shall redouble our efforts in favor of security and peace.\n210.\tWe must revive the political decision to negotiate and recommence meetings with a new impetus and a willingness to resolve the major problems of human rights, information and the military aspects of security.\n211.\tThe Madrid declaration must develop the principles of the Final Act of Helsinki and fulfill its ambitious objectives to improve the international climate, without illusions or complacency, which would be extremely dangerous. Thus shall we contribute to the revitalization in Europe of peace and security, which are constantly in question.\n212.\tI already had occasion at the last session [4th meeting, para. 138] to say that through the Lisbon Declaration, adopted in April 1980,9 the Spanish and British Governments have taken an important step forward, however preliminary, towards resolving the conflict between Spain and the United Kingdom concerning the colonial situation of Gibraltar I said then that we were dealing with a task that was not easy and events have borne that out, although it is important to maintain the convergence of political wills and to be ready to embark upon a path which may finally lead \\\"to settlement of the dispute, so that there will never again be any obstacle between Spain and the United Kingdom.\n213.\tThe United Nations has shown the path to follow, as is recognized in the joint Lisbon Declaration, which states that both parties have committed themselves to resolving the problem of Gibraltar in a spirit of friendship in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n214.\tSpain's relations with the peoples of Latin America are at a propitious stage. In the foreign policy of democratic Spain the close links of history, background and language are an element that strengthens our decision to find new means of drawing closer to the American continent and cooperating with its peoples. That relationship is an essential feature of our foreign policy. It is not a policy that was adopted simply because there was no alternative, but a policy that was selected and given preference over all others.\n215.\tWe are at a stage when everybody has become aware of the duty to increase specific projects, establish machinery to make them effective and, to the common benefit, give new life to our ancient ties. We have to give new energy to this relationship, which has gone through periods of rhetorical inaction imposed by certain historical circumstances.\n216.\tWe can only regret that some Central American countries have suffered cruel afflictions in the social sphere. Those peoples have the solution in their own hands, and any interference can only complicate the internal situation, which is caused by necessary changes. Spain feels the tragedy of those brother peoples deeply, and it is as if it were ourselves who were undergoing it.\n217.\tSpain reaffirms as one of the objectives of its present foreign policy its intention to multiply and diversify its relationship with African countries. Our attitude will be based, bilaterally and in the sphere of parliamentary diplomacy, on decisive support for efforts to put an end to colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination, and to cooperate, as far as we are able, in the socioeconomic development of that neighbor continent.\n218.\tOur geographical position places us in contact with the Arab coast of the Mediterranean and in a very close relationship with western Africa. We can see the reality of those two worlds without interference and we have justifiable hope that the EuroArab and EuroAfrican dialog, in which we shall participate increasingly as time goes by, will bring about new forms of effective cooperation.\n219.\tBecause of our closeness to and our particular interest in anything that affects the Arab nation, we continue to attach special importance to the situation in the Maghreb. We hope that as soon as possible tension between brother countries will disappear and that there will be an understanding that will allow for the development of interMaghreb relations, which would benefit greatly the peace and prosperity of all.\n220.\tWe have never failed to avail ourselves of this opportunity in the United Nations to stress the concern and attention demanded by the question of Western Sahara. Our position has been characterized by unswerving firmness of principle and support for a solution based on an agreement accepted by all the parties, which should take into account the principles and recommendations put forward by international bodies, and in particular the expression of the will of the people.\n221.\tThe Spanish Government favored the initiative taken by His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity in Nairobi, when he supported the idea of the referendum referred to in resolution AHG/Res. 103 (XVIII) [see A/361534, annex II] and the implementation of recommendations made by the African Heads of State who are members of the Ad Hoc Committee. That is a matter of capital importance which gives grounds for fresh hope with respect to finding a just solution by peaceful means, within the terms of recent commitments entered into ,at the meetings of the Organization\nof African Unity [OAU].\n222.\tOur policy of cooperation acquires special importance with reference to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Our action will always be guided by the principle of noninterference and by the desire to see Equatorial Guinea regain its rightful place in the regional context of the African community. We are prepared to strengthen our cooperation with the people of Equatorial Guinea and its Government to the extent that that Government freely desires. We feel that during this past year a broad network of cooperation has been put into effect and consolidated, which will give impetus, within the general framework of economic regeneration, to the national reconstruction of Equatorial Guinea.\n223.\t\tThe independence of Namibia is almost within reach. The Namibian people has a right to self-determination and immediate sovereignty over all its territory. The Spanish Government feels that only through the implementation without let or hindrance of the plan set forth in Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 439 (1978) can any progress by made on this matter. We must trust that the efforts being made at this very moment will lead to the resumption of the negotiating process and to Namibian independence.\n224.\tPerseverance is necessary in these endeavors, and the South African Government must be required to desist from any further counterproductive delaying tactics and from its indescribable acts of intimidation. Incursions into bordering countries are acts of force, in violation of the basic rules of international law, and simply increase the danger of global confrontations.\n225.\tIn this regard, the work carried out by the United Nations Council for Namibia should be commended. During the visit of that council to Spain a few months ago, we were able to appreciate the similarity of our positions with respect to the past and the future of Namibia, in particular with regard to recognition of the legitimacy of the representation conferred by the United Nations on SWAPO in its struggle, for freedom and independence.\n226.\tWith respect to apartheid, we must repeat our total rejection of the policy as a violation of human rights and, indeed, as an affront to man's reason. The existence of apartheid is a tragedy which is felt anew every day .and it is a blight on all mankind.\n227.\tConcerning this question and the tragic situation of refugees, Spain has taken part in two conferences organized jointly by the United Nations and the OAU; one, the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa, held at Geneva, and the other, the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, held in Paris. We believe that cooperation among international organizations is a productive means of international action. Such cooperation has proved effective in both cases, apartheid and assistance to African refugees.\n228.\tWith respect to the Middle East, almost everything possible has been said in the past 33 years. Today more than ever we are aware that this is not a knot that can be cut with a . sword. Unfortunately, in the course of the past 12 months force has again been used, in disregard of reason.\n229.\tIn Lebanon the tension curve is reaching new heights. There are various factors in that country which set the zone alight and threaten the integrity and very existence of the country. In the Security Council, Spain exerted every effort in support of the establishment of a ceasefire, after which the position could be stabilized and an impetus given to national reconciliation, preserving the independence, national integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon under the authority of its legitimately established Government. The work of UNIFIL, to which I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute, must be extended and strengthened as much as necessary to make it more effective. It should be fully supported so that it may be respected by all the parties to the conflict.\n230.\tIt is necessary to put an end to armed actions which continually endanger an unstable truce. The Spanish Government, on learning of the attack carried out by the Israeli air force against the nuclear research facility in Iraq, issued a communique strongly condemning that inadmissible act of force, which was a serious violation of the basic rules of international law. The Security Council condemned that action in resolution 487 (1981), considering that Iraq has a right to proper compensation for damage which Israel has admitted causing. Spain hopes that Israel will carry out the obligations which it bears as a Member of the Organization under Article 25 of the Charter and will respect that resolution. Spain, as it said again in the Security Council, also recognizes the sovereign and inalienable right of all States including Iraq to establish technological and nuclear programs for peaceful purposes.\n231.\tThe Spanish Government is still firmly convinced and this conviction seems to have been shared by the States who attended the meeting in Venice in 1980 of the European Council of the European Communities that the Middle East conflict cannot be understood or solved without the participation of the Palestinian people.\n232.\tThis year the situation has simply worsened, for peace cannot be envisaged as long as the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people are not recognized. The illegal settlements in the occupied territories continue, making any prospect of a solution difficult. A political negotiating machinery must be set up whereby Israel and the Palestinian people can both be represented and where they can mutually accept each other as valid negotiators. The legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, as many General Assembly resolutions show, is the PLO.\n233.\tAn overall agreement must be reached by which, based on the premise of the withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967, the enforcement of Palestinian national rights would be obtained through self determination. That would allow all present and future States in the region to achieve peace within safe and recognized frontiers. Only within such a framework will it be possible to achieve the coexistence and cooperation we would all like to see as a tangible reality.\n234.\tIn this respect, as I have had occasion to point out, it is our view that the plan for a just and global peace, recently put forward by His Highness Crown Prince Fhad of Saudi Arabia, 10 is a very positive contribution which must be given the consideration it deserves. These proposals are based on principles and criteria put forward in the Organization on many occasions, and Spain has repeatedly supported them. As long as the political road is barred for the Palestinian people, we can never have peace.\n235.\tAs for Afghanistan, more than a year and a half ago Soviet aggression was perpetrated against the Afghan people, an act of aggression which has resulted in the loss of many lives, the destruction of the country and the inability of the inhabitants freely to choose their political structures. Almost two years after the invasion there is no glimmer of a solution to that foreign armed intervention, which we have repeatedly condemned. We therefore feel that international pressure in favor of Afghan liberation should be kept up.\n236.\tWe fully support the resolutions of the General Assembly concerning the need for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the reestablishment of Afghanistan as a country free from foreign domination, as the basis for a just solution that would make it possible for the Afghan people to recover their independence and freely decide their own future. In this respect, we support the resolutions of the Islamic Conference [AI36/421 and Corr.l, annex II], the proposals of the European Community\\\" and the joint communique issued by the participants at the Ottawa Summit. 12 We also deplore the attitude of the Soviet Union towards those efforts by the international community, as well as the threat to peace and security in the region and indeed throughout the world represented by that attitude.\n237.\tKampuchea is another problem for which a solution seems no closer than it was last year. It is quite true that the International Conference on Kampuchea was held recently as requested by the General Assembly last year in resolution 35/6, and Spain took part in it. But it may also be noted that not every party to the dispute attended the Conference, nor was a joint plan to settle the problem agreed to. The Cambodian people are still victims of military occupation and violence. We will spare no effort to contribute to any valid solution, any approach allowing Kampuchea to be free and to live in peace and recognizing the sovereignty of its people, its independence and its territorial integrity.\n\n238.\tOne of the basic factors on which peace throughout the world depends is respect for human rights. Since 1948, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted, we have had a legal model which makes it possible to compare international conduct, and enough time has passed since then to set up additional machinery to safeguard such rights and to control any violations. Democratic Spain has signed and ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [General Assembly resolution 2200A (XXI), annex]. A few months ago, within a regional framework, we took yet another step and in the Council of Europe, made a statement of acceptance of the individual recourse provided for in article 25 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4 November 1950.\n239.\tWe base ourselves on the principle that any violation of human rights by a State is a violation of the rules of international conduct, that such violation is a cause of instability and international insecurity and that all such acts are to be condemned. AH those premises are supplemented by the unavoidable demand for an objective appraisal and determination of violations of human rights. This is a viewpoint which does not allow of any blind spots. This is not an asymmetrical concept which can be applied in one continent and not another at will, or in order to take advantage of the distress of people whenever it can be used for some monstrous reason of State, Human rights are the basis and cement of the social harmony and peace of States, and global defense of those rights is the irrevocable gain of contemporary human culture, the importance of which is such that it makes it possible to define limits in respect of the internal sphere of the State.\n240.\tBased on these convictions, Spanish democratic pluralism will require of itself and others the same scrupulous respect for human rights, convinced that the civilized survival of the human race demands it. Spain will support the establishment of machinery that will make it possible to control and, in the final analysis, prevent violations of human rights, without territorial or ideological selection or discrimination.\n241.\tTerrorism, which is a violation of the right to life, is the most brutal violation of human rights. The terrorist act which shamefully deprives innocent people of their life or threatens the vital security of a community by bloodshed cannot be justified. The consequences for international order are clear: we cannot compromise with terrorists without endangering peace. No one can claim to be persecuted for political reasons an allegation all too often made by the terrorist if that person is free in a free political society. Wherever political change can be sought without risk through regular elections allowing free expression of every option, none can claim to be persecuted for political reasons. There are no political offenders in a real democracy: if it is a democracy they do not exist; if they exist it is not a democracy.\n242.\tIt is abnormal to impose by force a nonexistent and brutal 'right' to kill and to seek protection outside one's borders, claiming that political freedom is needed when it already exists.\n243.\tSpain, like so many other European countries, is suffering from terrorism and has a legitimate interest in fighting for its eradication. But it is not only a desire for selfish security that makes us consider that international action against terrorism is called for. Peace and international security are directly affected. We do not live alone and the instability of any one member can result in instability for others. We must consider, as we have proposed in the European region both in the Council of Europe and in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe concrete measures that will effectively express the solidarity of the democratic States against terrorism, racism and totalitarian ideologies.\n244.\tIn the spring of 1982 there will be a second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The decade of the 1980s has been declared, most appropriately at this time, the 'Second Disarmament Decade'. However, there is undoubtedly some feeling that too many words have been wasted on this subject. It is plain that the world is rearming and that the arms escalation is continuing. Fresh conflicts break out, fresh invasions and acts of aggression, which do not augur well for any reduction in the stockpiling and production of war material far from it. Promises of disarmament are belied by statistics, and even public proposals for disarmament are merely a smokescreen for very different measures.\n245.\tThe Spanish Government is ready to help ensure that the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament will have real meaning and achieve results, opening the way to general and complete disarmament under effective international control, covering both nuclear and conventional weapons. It accordingly welcomes the AmericanSoviet talks announced today.\n246.\tThe definition of a new international economic order is based on an ethical requirement and a practical premise. A large scale crisis cannot be avoided unless we help the disinherited of the earth and contribute to their full development. In this connection, the recently held United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries are joint endeavors designed to give new impetus to international solidarity.\n247.\tI should like to mention the appeal made to the world and to the United Nations by 54 Nobel. Prize winners, including a Spanish poet. That group of exceptional people called not only for compassion on the part of the rich world, but also for common sense in helping those on whom hunger and underdevelopment inflict real suffering, and who are the victims of international political and economic disorder. The United Nations cannot disregard this problem or postpone its solution to a future that many will not live to see unless proper measures are taken now. The Spanish Government undertakes to maintain a sustained effort to see to it that global negotiations, efforts to restructure the international economic order, and the NorthSouth dialog should go beyond both diatribe and rhetoric and overcome the dual obstacle of the desire for a miraculous Utopia and the exaggerated realism of misconceived selfish interests.\n248.\tWe must say that a type of modernization consistent with the foreign policy of every industrial society organized as a pluralistic democracy requires the undertaking of international cooperation and the informing of national public opinion about the inevitability and collective benefit of international aid. The Spanish Government has given clear testimony of its position by radically increasing in 1981, within the limit of its resources, its cooperation with the least developed countries.\n249.\tThe Spanish Government is closely following, with some concern, the. work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea: closely, because the importance of that effort to codify and develop international law fully deserves such attention; with concern, because events that have occurred at the Conference this year may threaten its final success.\n250.\tThe Spanish Government has made great efforts at accommodation in the interests of a final consensus. I would not deny here that there are still a ,few articles of the draft convention as it stands now which we could not fully support, but we hope that a final negotiating effort will make it possible to achieve a text that Will respect\nState sovereignty and jurisdiction and that will realistically and effectively develop the universally accepted principle of the common heritage of mankind for the exploitation of the resources of the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\n251.\tThe Organization, which by reason of its universality of membership and functions accepts and deals with every conflict, has as do its Members a double duty: to fight for human freedom and to seek peace among peoples, It also has the obligation to propose solutions that are feasible today and to take action now.\n252.\tWe cannot afford to indulge in wishful thinking. I do believe, however, that a firm stand on questions of human rights, a reopening of the NorthSouth dialog and of disarmament negotiations, the success of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and a cleaning up of the many peripheral crises can all be achieved through political decisions that are within the realm of the possible.\n253.\tWe are at a dangerous stage. The United Nations, as the witness of our times, must bring all of us together so that it shall not be said of the coming year, in the words of that sombre verse of a contemporary Spanish poet, that \\\"Wounded peace with its dead wings was again covering the world\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "It is with deeply felt emotion that we heard the tragic news of the death of Anwar El Sadat, a great statesman who was assassinated yesterday morning in Cairo. His death is a great loss for the international community. This peace-loving man sought ardently for an equitable solution to the bloody conflict which has beset the Middle East. We would request the Egyptian delegation, therefore, to accept the sincere condolences of the Haitian delegation and to be kind enough to transmit these to the family of the deceased and to the Government and people of Egypt. We hope that Egypt, a friendly country, will emerge enlarged from this test, and we ardently hope that it will continue to progress along the paths of peace. \n61.\tI wish to address the warm congratulations of the Haitian delegation to Mr. Kittani on his election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His election has a symbolic value for us, because it is not only seen as a tribute to his own personal merits and to his qualities as a statesman and seasoned diplomat, but also as a tribute which, through his country, will reflect on to the entire third world. His outstanding intellectual and human qualities will undoubtedly make for the success of the work of this session, during which the international community will once again have to work together to meet the challenges of our era.\n62.\tI should also like to express our profound gratitude to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar for the competence and remarkable talent with which he discharged the delicate duties of the President at the thirty-fifth session.\n63.\tI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate to the SecretaryGeneral the considerable appreciation of the Government of the Republic of Haiti for the openness of mind, the loftiness of view and the competence with which he has devoted himself during the last 10 years to seeking a solution to the numerous problems of our time.\n64.\tI feel great pleasure in addressing the good wishes of my Government to the States of Vanuatu and Belize, which have just acceded to independence and have now become Members of the great family of the United Nations. We are convinced that they will unite with other Member States in the struggle for a world of peace, justice and fraternity.\n65.\tSince the last session, the international community has had to tackle complex problems, and in various parts of the world new hotbeds of tension have been ignited. The situations in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Indochina, Latin America and southern Africa are all subjects of profound concern for the international community. Everywhere we can descry grave threats to international peace and security. It is our duty to dispel these threats so that fear, anguish, mistrust and hate do not further poison international relations.\n66.\tPeace is indivisible, and the purposes of the Charter cannot be pursued as long as its noble ideals are being attacked and understanding and cooperation have not yet woven relationships of trust and mutual respect between the States Members of the Organization. Unfortunately, the arms race is continuing and intensifying, despite the enormous waste of resources which it involves and the chasm tragically deepening between the rich and poor countries.\n67.\tThis illustrates in concrete terms the lack of attention paid to the suffering of mankind and the obstinate refusal of the major Powers to make the small sacrifices needed to improve the lot of the poorest peoples of the earth. The world economic crisis which has persisted for many years now has worsened, and its repercussions have been felt principally in the already weakened economies of the poorest countries of the world. This situation and its tragedies will not disappear until the richest nations show some generosity and commit themselves resolutely to an out-and-out campaign against the hunger, disease, poverty, underdevelopment and ignorance which darken the daily life of millions of human beings. An objective analysis of the world situation strengthens the conviction that everywhere there have been very serious inroads into the living standards in many third world countries; the collective sufferings of whole continents point the finger at the greed or indifference of the wealthy nations. Every day new blows are being struck against human dignity. Unless these cries of anguish are heeded, they may well lead to tragic situations with unforeseeable consequences.\n68.\tThe continuing world economic crisis calls for new approaches. Actually, these approaches have been advocated for a long time now. Since the very first session of UNCTAD, in 1964, a new international division of labor has been demanded as an essential element in a new world economic order. The palliatives thus far applied to the system have been rather modest, whereas the new realities require a thoroughgoing revision of present thinking for the introduction of values which are more in accordance with a new view of the international economy. Indeed, that is the key to all the problems of our time, which it is our duty to resolve if we do not wish to reach a point of no return. Despite the failures for which we are collectively responsible, we cannot allow ourselves to be overcome by pessimism, which would discourage us from undertaking anything. The world should change the present situation the frightful situation of three quarters of the people of the world. It is to be hoped that intellectual speculations will be replaced by innovative action, which implies a great deal of courage and clear-sightedness. The solutions adopted to resolve the inflation crisis should be viewed in a global context, that is, that the major industrialized countries should be particularly careful not to harm the interests of the poorest countries and further aggravate the numerous difficulties already afflicting them.\n69.\tUndoubtedly, laudable efforts have already been made to seek solutions to the various imbalances to which humanity is exposed. Nevertheless, the gaps are widening. More people are dying of hunger every day. That requires a reassessment of the policy of aid and the strategy that have been adopted hitherto. From the conclusions deriving from our analysis, it is obviously necessary to bring about new international relations which are much more humanitarian and much more just. It is distressing to note that the developed countries are spending more than $1 million a minute on the arms race. If only one tenth of this sum could be diverted to meet the basic needs of a decent standard of living, the development thus generated would be so spectacular that it would far exceed the most optimistic hopes of mankind. Accordingly we wish to make an urgent and pressing appeal from this rostrum to States, particularly the great Powers, to devote a greater share of their resources to the service of life instead of to preparations for destruction and collective massacre.\n70.\tTherefore we hope for a resumption of the strategic arms limitation talks which, if successful, would help to remove the fearful specter of another war, which could only result in the multiplication of material devastation and moral suffering over entire continents of our planet. That is something which is indeed food for thought and which should make all of us work together. This is why my Government also attaches the greatest importance to the Tlatelolco Treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons in Latin America and hopes that General Assembly resolution 35/143 will be strictly implemented.\n71.\tIt is in order to avoid events leading to confrontation that we request the richest countries to increase their economic and financial participation in the aid programs of the United Nations specialized agencies and of other multilateral economic institutions. Those bodies can achieve their ideal of progress, peace and justice only with the support of Member States. Some specialized agencies, such as the World Bank and the IMF, for example, are failing to meet the fully justified expectations of the countries of the third world because of lack of funds. And this will always be so as long as these countries are not given the proper assistance and as long as the form of assistance has not been determined in response to the real needs of these recipient countries and with full respect for their individuality and the political choices they have made.\n72.\tIt is not a few token millions which will make it possible for the world to reduce the divide separating so many, peoples. What is needed is a new strategy with the aim of making it possible for more people to meet the basic costs of a decent standard of living and to be more confident in the future. This new strategy to which we refer and which must be the platform for development assistance implies not only the financing of certain projects but also an intelligent and appropriate transfer of certain types of technology which will in the long run help to guarantee a less insecure future for the most impoverished people of the earth. This new approach, together with a solution to the energy problem and a reform of the international monetary system, should in the long run enable the recipient countries, that is, the countries of the third world, to lose the feeling that they are on an eternal breadline and to achieve a certain autonomy in their development programs. That is precisely the underlying philosophy which should guide the action of the international community in establishing a new international economic order which is both just and equitable and which meets the aspirations of every human being to have more and to lead a better life.\n73.\tIndeed, we must deplore the numerous obstacles which up till now have stood in the way of achieving this. But we should also emphasize certain positive steps which should be multiplied and followed up. I should like to stress in particular the results obtained at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which made possible the adoption of a Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries.4 The Haitian Government earnestly hopes that this program of Action will be scrupulously implemented and that it indicates a growing political willingness by the rich countries to face up to the immense tragedy of underdevelopment in the third world.\n74.\tImproving the standards of living in the least developed countries will undoubtedly hinge on the assistance of the wealthier countries but also on that of the most advanced developing countries, particularly those which are petroleum exporters. It is in the name of this solidarity which should prevail among peoples that the head of the Haitian nation stated the following in a recent address:\n\\\"Cooperation should be imbued with more Solidarity and justice and should provide us with the image of a family of nations united by a mutual desire to promote a new socio-political order in harmony with the fundamental aspirations of all peoples. ... We should not allow sterile egoism to tarnish the profound nature of man and the hope which heralds the dawn of an international cooperation based on reciprocal trust, mutual respect and the right of peoples to self-determination.\\\"\n73. The United Nations is still the only international body in which all States, great and small, can unite their efforts to achieve peace and universal prosperity. The Organization has had to face many pitfalls since its creation. Although it has not been able to provide specific solutions for all the problems which affect mankind, its very existence is evidence of its vitality. Hie Organization has been able to adapt itself to new times, and it is essential for mankind's future that it survive.\n76.\tFor some years now the General Assembly has been playing an increasingly important role in the Organization. A simple review of the numerous items which are included in the agenda of the present session provides an eloquent testimony of that. The unprecedented efforts that have been made for many years now to close the tremendous gap separating the rich and the poor countries have resulted in the creation of UNCTAD, which is playing an increasingly important role on the international scene.\n77.\tThe Republic of Haiti is very gratified that that is so, but it remains true that not all United Nations organs have evolved in such a fortunate way. This at least partially explains the heavy work program which falls to the lot of the General Assembly; and the increasing number of agenda items in each session makes it impossible for each of them to be given proper attention.\n78.\tThe question of increasing the number of non-permanent members of the Security Council is timely. Most of the States Members of the Organization did not participate in the Council's creation. It is therefore quite natural that they would like to be directly involved in the activities of an organ as important as the Security Council. My Government is very sympathetic to this point of view and is aware of the numerous advantages that would stem therefrom. Nevertheless, this matter deserves to be weighed very seriously and can be successfully solved only if there is a political willingness on the part of the permanent members of the Council. Painstaking and serious negotiations will therefore be necessary, because any undue haste in this matter would result in weakening an organ the usefulness of which is universally recognized.\n79.\tIt has become the rule in the United Nations to proclaim the need for all peoples to respect the principles and ideals which derive from the Charter. The Haitian Government's position in the light of the potential or actual conflicts which disturb and alarm our world is dictated by our unshakeable faith in the competent organs of the United Nations and the legal rules which have been unanimously accepted by the Member States.\n80.\tLatin America and the Caribbean have not escaped the profound changes which are a feature of current international relations and which occasionally take the form of violent upheavals that endanger the stability and security of the continent.\n81.\tThe present situation in the sister Republic of El Salvador involves a very serious threat to the peace of the hemisphere; that is why the Government of Haiti would associate itself with any initiative designed to find an equitable internal solution to the tragedy of the people of El Salvador\n82.\tThe Republic of Haiti is very pleased at the brotherly and cordial nature of the relations that prevail between it and the Dominican Republic. That country's Secretary of State for External Relations, who preceded me at this rostrum, particularly stressed the significance of this.\n83.\tAs regards the conflict of the Middle East, we deplore the deaths, the' material devastation and all the misfortunes that are the daily lot of millions of human beings. The Republic of Haiti considers that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) provides an adequate basis for a just, lasting and satisfactory peace among the parties concerned. Recognition of Israel's need for secure and recognized frontiers and recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination are the fundamental prerequisites for any negotiated solution to that conflict. It is essential that the peoples directly concerned give up their intransigent positions and seize any opportunity for dialog that would help to reinforce the efforts already being undertaken in order to bring about a comprehensive solution of that conflict. If that peace is not achieved, there is a grave danger that all the nations of that region will be plunged into a catastrophic situation. That state of permanent tension endangers world peace.\n84.\tSince 1946 the question of South Africa's racist policy has been on the agenda of all the regular sessions of the General Assembly. That inhuman and abhorrent policy still troubles the conscience of the world. The Republic.of Haiti, the foreign policy of which is based on historic traditions of freedom and fraternity, cannot remain indifferent to the indescribable sufferings being endured by the people of South Africa.\n85.\tApartheid is not only a flagrant violation of human rights; it is above all a system of oppression and exploitation of the indigenous population of South Africa by a racist minority which monopolizes economic and political power. It is therefore distressing to see that that regime continues to enjoy considerable support. The report of the Special Committee against Apartheid makes specific reference to this. It lists by country the economic, military and even nuclear assistance which certain countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] continue to provide to that racist regime. And yet all those countries are Members of our Organization and, on numerous occasions, have reaffirmed their devotion to the Charter of the United Nations. Can it be that they think differently in the case of South Africa? It is only the ill considered assistance given to that regime that has made it possible for it to develop into a system a policy based on racism and slavery more than a century after the abolition of slavery.\n86.\tThe Republic of Haiti, because of its racial affiliation and historic traditions, must be in the van of all the movements attempting to combat racism and colonialism. That is why it has always been active in attempts to adopt sanctions against the infamous regime of South Africa.\n87.\tAt the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa held at Paris, the universal condemnation and growing isolation of the South African Government were clearly demonstrated. Nevertheless, certain major Powers did not see fit to take part. I should like to take this opportunity to ask them once again to adopt a firmer attitude against South Africa, because we are convinced that only effective sanctions can induce that regime to comply with the relevant resolutions of the Organization.\n88.\tDespite the many resolutions of the Security Council and the almost unanimous disapproval of the international community, South Africa still maintains its illegal domination over the Namibian people. This shocking state of affairs unfortunately continues because certain States which are more concerned with their economic advantages tolerate, in defiance of morality and civilized values, the unspeakable attitude of South Africa, which runs counter to resolutions in the adoption of which those States were involved. My Government reaffirms its commitment to the cause of the liberation of the Namibian people and their independence. We remain convinced that the United Nations is equal to the task of leading the people of Namibia to self-determination. That has always been our view since the General Assembly ended South Africa's Mandate over Namibia and placed that Territory under the authority of the United Nations Council for Namibia until it reaches independence.\n89.\tThe eighth emergency special session, on Namibia, convened in September was a further milestone in mobilizing the international community in order to lead the Namibian people to self-determination by peaceful means. Effective sanctions are essential if we are to break the stubborn resistance of the South African regime. Those States which have hitherto balked at the inevitability of sanctions against South Africa are falling into a grave error if they think that their attitude will lead that country to give up its policy of aggression. On the contrary, the Pretoria regime feels encouraged and does not hesitate to commit flagrant acts of aggression against the front-line States, particularly Angola and Zambia. It is therefore imperative for the international community to do everything necessary to bring that racist Government to reason, since it represents a serious threat to international peace and security. The dangers that I have just described appear even more imminent in the light of South Africa's nuclear activities. There is therefore an urgent need for all such aid to that country to be suspended.\n90.\tA negotiated solution to the question of Afghanistan has so far been impossible, despite all the efforts of the international community. Once again the Haitian people express their solidarity with the Afghan people. This armed intervention of a major Power adds to the unfortunately already long list of occupations of small countries by stronger ones under false pretexts, occupations which always meet with the stubborn resistance of the victims.\n91.\tSuch acts of aggression, constituting as they do a challenge to the international rule of law, cause pointless suffering to innocent people. Thus hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees who have been expelled from their homes are leading a precarious existence in temporary camps. However, we are convinced that, with the underlying rationality of history the Afghan people will recover their territorial integrity and their full dignity. The Republic of Haiti condemns outright this serious threat to the political independence of Afghanistan and considers that a solution to the conflict cannot be achieved without the immediate, unconditional and complete withdrawal of foreign troops.\n92.\tIn Kampuchea the situation is equally deplorable and is an affront to the rule of law. The Haitian people, a peace-loving and freedom-loving people, will never compromise on those essential principles. The harmonious relations that my country enjoys with most of the other members of the international community are dictated by a desire for understanding and cooperation. It is in this context that my delegation declares itself ready to support any peace initiatives. We particularly deplore the fact that one of the parties to the conflict boycotted the International Conference on Kampuchea. However, we are convinced that the resolutions adopted at that Conference are likely to promote a just and final settlement of the conflict. Furthermore, we support the idea that an immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea is a necessary prerequisite to all serious negotiations.\n93.\tSimilarly, the Government of the Republic of Haiti cannot but encourage any initiatives which will help promote a negotiated solution to the war which pits Iran against Iraq and to the conflict which for three decades has artificially divided the Korean nation.\n94.\tIn reflecting on the many addresses that we have already heard from this rostrum, we cannot help concluding that they all meet at one precise point the profound desire of nations to live and develop in peace and harmony, according to the spirit which imbued those who signed the Charter at San Francisco. This feeling is shared by all of us, with no differences of ideology or faith or any other differences. This demonstrates unity in the diversity of philosophy and political beliefs and expresses eloquently how much man is essentially a being of peace, the peace which engenders progress and will ensure for future generations the comfort of a happy life.\n95.\tNevertheless, harmony in this vocation of peace unfortunately meets other obstacles, which cannot be eliminated unless peoples are willing to give up their intransigence and their desire to dominate. The coming of that world which we all want undoubtedly requires work which will last a long time, but it is not a mirage. We can achieve it through understanding and sincere dialog.\n96.\tIn the name of that ideal we invite the nations to unite. In the name of that ideal we urge upon States more understanding, more generosity and more humanity. Such is the ardent wish of the people and Government of the Republic of Haiti at the beginning of this session.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "53.The English version of his statement was supplied by the delegation. *Mr. President, I should like, first of all, to take this opportunity to convey to you the congratulations of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany on your election to this high office. We see in you a man of distinction who, in his long and active involvement in the work of the United Nations, has shown exceptional qualities. We see in you the representative of one of the leading members of the non aligned movement, a country with which we have had good, longstanding relations.\n54.\tI should also like to express my country's gratitude to the President of the thirty-fifth session of the General As sembly, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar. He discharged the du ties of his office with a sense of awareness of the new reality of global interdependence. In so doing he was able to count on the full approval and support of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n55.\tAt the same, time, I wish to thank the Secretary General for his dedicated work over the past 12 months on behalf of the Organization, and thus also on behalf of peace.\n56.\tOn behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany, I extend a warm welcome to Vanuatu as a new Member of the United Nations.\n57.\tFor a decade now, the world economy has been in a critical phase of readjustment: inflation, recession and unemployment in the industrialized countries, but, above all, stagnating indeed, declining per capita incomes in many developing countries. The want and distress of the poor in the third world are increasing. At the same time, the world population continues to grow rapidly: over the next 20 years it will increase from 4.5 billion to approximately 6.5 billion people. This means that food, clothing and housing, schools and jobs have to be provided for 2 billion people. That is equivalent to the population of 2,000 completely new cities, each with 1 million inhabitants. This shows that mankind as a whole is faced with great and global challenges.\n58.\tYet and this is the disturbing part of it is not these problems that are the focal point of world politics and of world interests: the headlines of the international press tell us, rather, about an arms race and tensions between nations, about war, civil war and intervention. At a time when global interdependence and global cooperation have become a question of survival, the human race is in danger of once again pitting its strength against itself.\n59.\tNow, at a time when we ought to be concentrating our material as weK as our intellectual resources on the task of bringing the world economy out of its structural crisis, on development in the third world and on preserving the conditions of life on our planet, $500 billion is being wasted on arms. But our children and grandchildren will judge us solely by whether we have succeeded in setting me world on the road to peace, development and survival, or whether we have declined into confrontation, an arms race and, ultimately, catastrophe.\n60.\tWe can preserve world peace and master the great challenges to mankind only if all countries act in accordance with principles that are commensurate with the provisions and the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. This calls for renunciation of force, that is to say, renunciation of the use and threat of use of force, since conflicts must be settled by peaceful means; for no aspiration to domination over others, no interference in the internal affairs of other coun tries and respect for the right of self determination of all nations; for responsible action with an awareness of global interdependence, using moderation and restraint in pursuing one's own interests; for readiness for dialogue, negotiation and cooperation; for no aspiration to superiority, but rather a desire for balance at the lowest possible level of arma ments, adhering to an active policy of preserving peace through cooperation on issues of international security and, in particular, of arms control and disarmament; and, finally, for elimination of the NorthSouth confrontation as part of a policy of worldwide partnership and the safeguarding of peace.\n61.\tIn the search for a solution to these global problems, very great importance attaches to the development of East West relations. At the beginning of the 1970s we all hoped that the efforts increasingly to reduce the differences between East and West and to expand cooperation would prove successful, and considerable progress in the development of East-West relations was indeed achieved in the first half of that decade. But of late the East-West confrontation has intensified yet again. It threatens to push the North South dialog to the periphery of world affairs once more. Indeed, the East-West confrontation threatens to spread to the South.\n62.\tThat must not be allowed to happen. East and West must do everything possible to pull themselves back onto a course leading to stability in their relations and to cooperation. On no account must East and West allow the third world to become a theater for the continuation of their conflict. The countries of the South have problems enough and should not also be made the scene of the contest be tween East and West.\n63.\tNegotiations on arms control and disarmament with the aim of establishing a balance at the lowest possible level are more urgent than ever. There must not be another arms race.\n64.\tIn the 1970s the Soviet Union made extraordinary efforts in all fields of armaments. They were not matched by comparable efforts on the part of the West; quite the contrary.\n65.\tThe West has noted with great concern how the Soviet Union has not only increased its superiority as regards conventional forces but has at the same time stepped up its medium-range nuclear weapons and given them new quality, in particular with the SS20 missile and the \\\"Backfire\\\" bomber. Our concern about these developments can only be dispelled if the current and proposed East-West negotiations are successful. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will contribute all it possibly can to the achievement of that aim.\n66.\tWe hope that the meeting between Secretary of State Haig and Foreign Minister Gromyko will mark the beginning of a new, constructive phase in the dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union, which is of such importance for the whole world. The importance and weight of the United States and the Soviet Union give both countries a special responsibility for world peace. Dialog, negotiation and cooperation between East and West must 'be intensified and further developed. This also includes the continuation of the SALT process.\n67.\tWe also hope that the meeting between the United States Secretary of State and the Soviet Foreign Minister will above all give a signal for the start of negotiations on medium-range nuclear weapons. We have advocated such negotiations for quite some time. We have been involved in the preparations for them with our allies, and we will continue to follow them in the future. We want medium-range nuclear missiles on both sides to be limited to equal ceilings at the lowest possible level, and the more the Soviet Union reduces its arms buildup, the lower that level can be. If that arms buildup is eliminated altogether, there will no longer be any need for the West to deploy medium-range weapons as envisaged.\n68.\tThe Government and people of the Federal Republic of Germany long for nothing more dearly than a result of that kind, which to us would be the ideal result. But it is not only a question of nuclear weapons. In the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe, we are resolutely pursuing the aim of achieving a balance of forces in central Europe by means of mutual reductions, in order to improve military stability and to rid the peoples of central Europe of the fear of possible surprise attack.\n69.\tAs a result of the Madrid review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, we want a conference or disarmament in Europe as a forum for agreement on concrete confidence building measures for the whole of Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals.\n70.\tIt is not only East and West that have to tackle the task of arms control and disarmament. That task is universal and applies to all regions and to all countries.\n71.\tThe United Nations already proclaimed the 1970s the United Nations Disarmament Decade, but we are all pain fully conscious of the scant success of our efforts to stop the worldwide arms spiral.\n72.\tMy country has put forward as its contribution to the General Assembly's second special session devoted to disarmament, to be held in 1982, a draft comprehensive pro gramme or disarmament.4 Its purpose is to facilitate world wide disarmament negotiations, to describe the conceptual framework for such negotiations, to define the criteria and principles, and thus to carry out important preparatory work for concrete negotiations and results.\n73.\t1 wish to mention four principles in particular: balance, openness, verifiability and confidence building.\n74.\tDisarmament negotiations can only prove successful if they enhance the security of all concerned. Whoever seeks one sided \\\"advantages in disarmament negotiations or tries to hold on to those already gained will create a deadlock. The aim must be balance at the lowest possible level. Superiority of one side causes instability and this in turn poses a threat to peace. Balance and parity constitute the recognized central principle of the SALT negotiations.\n75.\tBut that principle must not be restricted to the SALT process. In their joint declaration of 6 May 1978, General Secretary Brezhnev and Federal Chancellor Schmidt said that \\\"both sides deem it important that no one should seek military superiority and that they proceed on the assumption that approximate equality and parity suffice to safeguard defense\\\".\n76.\tIt is now necessary to ensure that in the disarmament negotiations between East and West this principle is translated into practical, concrete policies.\n77.\tDisarmament presupposes transparency of the force relationship. Each side must openly give information about its own force strengths and armaments. Anyone trying to evade this is sowing the seeds of mistrust and casting doubt upon his intentions. The United Nations has elaborated a standardized reporting system with a view to making military budgets comparable. My country, like some other Western and nonaligned countries, has submitted a report on its defense budget in line with that system. All other countries should follow that example.\n78.\tI repeat my proposal that the United Nations should set up two registers: first, one which records how much each industrial country spends per capita on armaments and how much it spends on development assistance; and secondly, another register which lists worldwide exports and imports of weapons. This would be an important first step. The international community cannot look on indifferently as military spending in East and West and in the third world continues to increase while development aid budgets stagnate.\n79.\tThe obligations assumed in disarmament negotiations must be verifiable. The verification procedure must in each individual case be tailored to the treaty to which it is to apply. We can do some important preliminary work in that respect in the United Nations if we develop procedures and instruments of verification which have been internationally agreed upon and, where possible, also tried out in practice.\n80.\tAnyone who opposes on site inspections or refuses to accept verification in other forms will be open to the suspicion of wanting to hide something and deceive others; he will be destroying confidence rather than building it.\n81.\tThe Geneva Committee on Disarmament is discussing a comprehensive prohibition of the manufacture and stock piling of chemical weapons. Here, too, the most difficult problem still to be solved is that of verification. We hope for an early agreement on the verifiable prohibition of chemical weapons.\n82.\tReal disarmament can be achieved only through mutual confidence among States. Concrete confidence building measures are therefore indispensable for successful dis armament. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975, makes provision for initial confidence building measures. The proposed conference on disarmament in Europe could be a new qualitative step in the process of confidence building. confidence building measures can al$oNbe conducive to stability and arms limitation in the third world. It was with that in mind that, during the thirty-fourth session, we launched an initiative with a view to giving a global dimension to efforts to achieve confidence building meas ures.\n83.\tWe hope that the SecretaryGeneral's study now before us [At36/474 and Corr. 1] will generate effective impulses for concrete measures to speed up the confidence building process all over the world. We need a code of confidence building.\n84.\tThose four principles for disarmament negotiations balance, openness, verifiability and confidence building are four prerequisites for success. They can serve as four cornerstones for the construction of a comprehensive security partnership around the world.\n85.\tThe foremost objective of my country's foreign policy is actively to safeguard peace. We want peace and freedom. But to us, peace means more than the mere avoidance of war. We want a world of cooperation based on partnership among nations.\n86.\tTogether with other European democracies we have formed the European Community in order to shape our common future together. By developing the European Community into a European union, we shall be able to work even more effectively as a force for peace and progress in Europe and in the world.\n87.\tWe have united with our European allies and the United States of America and Canada in the North Atlantic Alliance. That alliance rests on the common values of free dom, human dignity and self determination. Its sole pur pose is to preserve common security and safeguard peace. It derives its strength from the friendship and trust between Europeans and Americans.\n88.\tOn the basis of the European Community and the North Atlantic Alliance we, the Federal Republic of Germany, have, by means of our Ostpolitik, made an important contribution to the stabilization of peace in Europe. We shall continue that realistic policy of dialog, of reducing tensions and of strengthening cooperation.\n89.\tThe line that divides East and West also divides the German nation. Consequently, no one is more severely affected by any deterioration of the East-West relation ship than the Germans; no one has a more direct interest in improving East-West relations. There must be no re lapse into the cold war.\n90.\tThe policy of the Federal Republic of Germany of concluding treaties with its neighbors in the East the Moscow Treaty, the Warsaw Treaty, the treaty with Czechoslovakia and the Basic Treaty with the German Democratic Republic are testimony to our longterm policy of cooperation and detente. We abide by those treaties. It is our wish that General Secretary Brezhnev's visit to Bonn in November will strengthen our bilateral relations and will favourably influence East-West relations as a whole.\n91.\tThe developments in Poland are of particular importance for the situation in Europe and in the world. It is up to Poland alone to determine its path. We expect all other signatories of the Final Act of Helsinki, like ourselves, to refrain from any interference in the internal affairs of the Polish People's Republic.\n92.\tThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany reaffirms its conviction that the two German States bear special responsibility for peace in Europe. Never again must war originate on German soil, as stated by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Chairman of the German Democratic Republic State Council, Erich Honecker.\n93.\tEspecially in the present difficult phase of East-West relations, the following must be axiomatic to both German' States: we must carefully preserve what we have achieved between us and what we have contributed to peace in Eu rope over the past decade; in our mutual relationship and in relations with all our neighbors we must exercise restraint and consideration; the GermanGerman relationship must never be an additional cause of strain on the East West relationship; we must continue the dialogue at all levels without any preconditions; it must be our common goal to achieve the largest measure of progress in implementing all parts of the Final Act of Helsinki,\n94.\tThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany intends to promote cooperation between the two German States, and we want to provide more opportunities for contacts between Germans on both sides. Those and other improvements which make life easier for the Germans in their mutual relationship are not only a dictate of humanity but are an indispensable contribution to peace and cooperation in Europe.\n95.\tOur aim is and will remain to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will recover its unity in free self determination. The wall which divides the Germans will not prove durable. The will of the people is not to preserve, still less to deepen, the division between them, but to remove it.\n96.\tThe Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin has helped to calm the situation in and around Berlin. That must remain so. Each side must realize that the Agreement can produce a stabilizing effect on Berlin and favourably influence East-West relations only if all sides strictly observe and fully implement it.\n97.\tAnother impressive testimony to United States solidarity with Berlin was the visit by the American Secretary of State Mr. Haig on 13 September 1981.\n98.\tAs in our bilateral policy, we are also striving within the multilateral framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to improve East' West relations in Europe. The Final Act of Helsinki is a document which manifests the will for cooperation in Europe, and it should be consistently implemented by all signatories to make Europe a region of lasting peace based on respect for human rights.\n99.\tWe are acutely aware how much still remains to be done in that respect. Together with om Western partners, we are making every effort to ensure that the follow-up to the Conference, in Madrid, will produce a final document which, in all fields covered by the Final Act, will bring progress for cooperation among the countries of Europe and make for better relations among their citizens.\n100.\tThe process of the Conference on Security and Co operation in Europe must be continued. It is the great hope of many people, not only in Europe. The Madrid Conference must issue a concrete mandate for a conference on disarmament in Europe if it is to meet the need for security in Europe.\n101.\tThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany also wishes to contribute to peace and the peaceful settlement of conflicts outside Europe. The agenda for this session of the General Assembly includes items on four major international conflicts: the Middle East, southern Africa, Afghanistan and Kampuchea.\n102.\tAt the previous meeting, the President of the European Community also spoke on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany. Following.his statement, let me say that we have a vital interest of our own in lasting, comprehensive and equitable peace in the Middle East. Israel's right to live within secure and recognized boundaries is just as indispensable for such peace as is recognition of the right of self determination of the Palestinian people. The efforts to achieve a comprehensive, lasting and equitable peace settlement must be intensified. The starting point for this must be the renunciation of force by all sides.\n103.\tIt is with a sense of concern for world peace and deep sympathy for the suffering of the people that we watch events in Lebanon. All efforts undertaken by the Lebanese Government to bring about national conciliation and to restore Lebanon's sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity have our full support.\n104.\tIn the context of the initiative of the five Western States, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is emphatic that Namibia should at long last gain independence through free elections on the basis of Security Council .resolution 435 (1978). This must happen in 1982. The independence of Namibia must not be delayed any longer. We acknowledge the constructive contribu tions of the OAU towards a settlement of the Namibia question. The remnants of colonialism and racism in southern Africa must be eliminated.\n105.\tWe condemn South Africa's intervention in An gola; the Republic of South Africa has taken a grave responsibility upon itself.\n106.\tMy country stands side by side with the non aligned and Islamic countries in an effort to terminate the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and to achieve a political solution which will restore to that sorely tried people self determination and independence and reestablish Afghanistan's status as a genuinely nonaligned State. The European Council has proposed a conference on Afghanistan with the aim of achieving that goal in two phases. The continuing occupation of Afghanistan is a heavy strain on international relations.\n107.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany actively sup ports the efforts of the international community, and especially the ASEAN countries, to restore the political in dependence and territorial integrity of Kampuchea.\n108.\tWe are following with concern developments in Central America where, in El Salvador, and also else where, the use of force and bloodshed are on the in crease. The people of that region must be enabled to determine their own destiny free from direct or indirect intervention from outside. \n109.\tAll democratic forces in those countries should act in awareness of their common responsibility and dissociate themselves from the forces of violence. Like the whole of the third world, like the whole of Latin America, Central America, too, must be kept out of the East West conflict. Political and social reforms must create a more equitable and stable order, and with it the conditions which will allow Central America to become a region of peace. The European Community can be a good partner to such a Central America.\n110.\tAt its thirty-fifth session, the General Assembly included in its agenda a new item entitled \\\"International cooperation to avert new flows of refugees\\\". In resolution 35/124, it expressed the conviction that the refugee issue is no longer a humanitarian one only, but also affects world peace. As the resolution stated, the flows of hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of refugees '\\\"jeopardize the stability of entire regions and thus \\\"endanger international peace and security\\\".\n111.\tWe, the Federal Republic of Germany, favour general guidelines for the conduct of States, as well as practical measures which will make it possible to prevent any fresh flows of refugees, and ws propose that this be discussed by an ad hoc committee.\n112.\tThe General Assembly is commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Conference of Heads of State of Government of NonAligned Countries held at Belgrade in 1961. The nonaligned countries constitute a powerful movement in the world of today, but their goal has not yet been fully attained.\n113.\tColonialism is almost everywhere a thing of the past, but the independence that has been gained by for mer colonies is threatened by attempts to dominate them in other ways. In 1979, in fact, the world witnessed an ideologically motivated attempt to make the nonaligned movement itself, as it was called, the \\\"natural ally\\\" of one of the two systems of the North. That attempt failed. It had to fail, because the wheel of history cannot be turned back. There is no longer any future in hegemonic aspirations, nor in interventions in the internal affairs of other countries, but they can still be a threat to peaceful relations between nations.\n114.\tWith its model of a pluralistic world of nations who have chosen their own destiny, the nonaligned movement is a force_working for the cause of progress. It is at the same time a force working for the cause of peace and stability because today both these aims can be achieved only within an international order in which nations cooperate with one another in partnership and on the basis of free self determination and equality. The Federal Republic of Germany stands side by side with the nonaligned countries in the pursuit of this goal.\n115.\tThe desire for independence also manifests itself in the regional groupings which are being formed and are growing in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n116^ After the European Community, there is now an other association, ASEAN, which has already developed extensively. A powerful influence for peace and liability in Asia emanates from that organization.\n117.\tRegional cooperation is also progressing elsewhere in the third world. Cooperation among the Gulf States, the groupings that have been formed in Latin America, and those already established or to be established in Africa, which were all molded into a grand design by the Conference of Lusaka, are proof of this. These groupings also provide small and medium-sized countries with an opportunity to shape their independence and their future\ntogether.\n118.\tTogether with the other members of the European Community, we promote this development towards plurality and partnership based on equality. Stable economic and social development in the third world is indispensable for lasting international peace;\n119.\tThe common goal of the industrial and developing countries in the 1970s was to accelerate growth in the developing countries in the context of constant global economic growth, but it did not turn out that way. Today, at the beginning of the Third United Nations Development Decade, the growth of per capita incomes has stopped in many oil-importing countries of the third world. Indeed, real per capita incomes in most of the poorest countries are even declining. We view with concern this crisis of development.\n120.\tWe also view with concern the fact that the North South dialog has lost momentum. In spite of the progress achieved in many individual areas, it is marking time on the major issues. That is why we look towards the forthcoming International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held at Cancun. An important idea of the Brandt Commission becomes a reality. The great opportunity afforded by this unprecedented Cancun meeting must be seized. We want it to generate a new resolve to settle the urgent problems of the world econ omy and development by means of solidarity and global cooperation. Lastly, we want it to pave the way for the beginning at long last of global negotiations. We want to work for a global energy strategy which will create security among both producers and consumers. We want to work for a global food strategy in order to guarantee food security and thus eliminate hunger.\n121.\tThe outcome of the twelfth session of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, to be held in 1982, will be crucial. Its importance for the future of the North-South dialog Can hardly be overestimated because, as the SecretaryGeneral has emphasized, it is a question of whether we in the United Nations are capable of negotiating solutions for global problems which strike a fair balance between the elementary and basic interests of all nations and at the same time serve the world as a whole,\n122.\tA return to world economic growth and development calls, first and foremost, for energetic efforts on the part of all countries. The industrial countries must break the back of inflation and thus restore the basis for constant growth and the elimination of unemployment. The nations of the third world, on the other hand, must adopt development strategies that involve the masses of the poor in the growth process. Labor intensive agricultural production and industries, coupled with an effective population policy, must form the nucleus of development plans. But if they are to be successful, the efforts of the developing countries themselves need adequate support from outside. All countries in a position to do so should contribute their share. The Communist industrial countries must no longer shirk their duty to help the nations of the third world in a spirit of solidarity.\n123.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany gives high priority cooperation in the field of development. This means, first, that in spite of our own economic difficulties we shall not relax our efforts to provide financial and technical assistance. Even our budget for 1982, which is one of self-restraint for our citizens, allows our development aid to grow at a greater rate than that of the budget as a whole. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany welcomes the programme of action adopted at the United Nations Conference en the Least Developed Countries, held recently in Paris, because these countries are the ones that depend most on official development aid.  \n124.\tSecondly, we are still strongly in favor of markets in industrial countries being kept open and widened to take in the exports of developing countries. There must be no lapse into protectionism. We do not try to solve our problem of unemployment by erecting trade barriers, but by promoting structural change with the necessary supporting social measures. Only with free world trade can North and South advance.\n125.\tThirdly, to many developing countries, exports of raw materials are still the main source of foreign exchange. These countries in particular are suffering as a result of the decline in the growth of the world economy, a situation which has lasted for several years now and which has checked demand for raw materials and caused prices to drop. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany attaches great importance to the problems confronting commodity-exporting developing countries. We have just decided to make a substantial voluntary contribution to the Second Account of the Common Fund for Commodities.\n126.\tFourthly, the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy has, for the first time, made energy issues a subject of negotiations within a global framework. We must continue along this path. The steep, abrupt increase in the price of energy has placed a heavy burden on the industrial countries. To the oil-importing developing countries, it has become a question of their very existence. We need partnership and cooperation between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC], industrial countries and oil-importing developing countries. This is the only way the world can come through the transition to the post-oil era intact. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany also advocates the establishment of a World Bank affiliate for energy which could help considerably to resolve the energy problems of the third world.\n127.\tWe must not allow national egoism to gain the upper hand in the process of NorthSouth cooperation. We are called upon to play our part the industrial countries of the West and of the East and the developing countries. The NorthSouth problem is not merely the global social issue; it is a task of world peace which we shall have to accomplish if we want to ensure the survival of mankind.\n128.\tTo the Federal Republic of Germany, respect for and protection of the dignity aild the rights of man are fundamental to all policies. Efforts to secure the exercise of human rights throughout the world are therefore one of the central elements of our participation in the work of the United Nations. We deem it the responsibility of the Organization to raise its voice whenever fundamental human rights are violated, irrespective of where and by whom.\n129.\tThe United Nations has created procedures and institutions to foster respect for human rights all over the globe. These procedures are still relatively weak, but they are having a growing effect. It is important to continue this work with determination and to develop further the possibilities open to the United Nations for protecting human rights. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany continues to support the idea of an international court of human rights.\n130.\tWe have rioted with satisfaction that our initiative regarding a convention on the ultimate abolition of the death penalty has met with a favorable response from many countries. The draft convention takes the form of a second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This form should make for constructive discussion leading to progress in this field.\n131.\tThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is aware that other legal traditions, religious convictions and historical experiences have led many countries to take a different view of the death penalty. But no one can overlook the frequent abuses of the death penalty in the world of today and the growing incidence of executions without regard for the due process of law. Equally depressing is the fact that people are still subjected to torture. This makes the struggle to abolish the death penalty and torture more urgent than ever.\n132.\tMankind has reached the highest point to date in its level of knowledge and in its capabilities. It can use that knowledge and those capabilities to resolve the problems vital to its survival, but it can also use them to destroy the earth's civilization and, perhaps, even the human species.\n133.\tOnly if we act in awareness of our responsibility for the safeguarding of peace and respect for the dignity of man, and only if we act with the desire for global solidarity, will we find the way to a good future. This is the foremost task of the Organization. The Federal Republic of Germany reaffirms its trust in the United Nations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "69.\tPermit me first of all to convey the congratulations of my Government to Mr. Kittani on his election as President of the General Assembly. That action is an appropriate honoring of his country and of his distinguished personal qualities. The Organization has placed its trust in a highly qualified person who, because, of his experience, is well aware of the delicate responsibilities of his high post.\n70.\tI also wish to express the congratulations of my Government to his illustrious predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, who, by his actions during a particularly difficult time, amply justified the trust placed in him by the international community.\n71.\tLet me also take this opportunity to welcome me admission to the United Nations of two new States, Vanuatu and Belize. Colombia is pleased to note this new and important step in the process of decolonization, and offers its best wishes for the peace and prosperity of both new nations.\n72.\tThe report on the work of the Organization presented to the Assembly by the SecretaryGeneral [A/36/1] is further proof of his intelligent approach to complex situations and serious conflicts; it provides much food for thought, including an objective description of the difficulties and challenges which place formidable obstacles in the path to world peace.\n73.\tThis annual meeting of the General Assembly has been overshadowed by the tragic news of the assassination of President Anwar El Sadat. He was a statesman who fought for world peace with exemplary courage and constancy. His death, which has moved all those working for harmony among peoples, was his legacy to that cause, to which we should all contribute with the same courage and with a similar will to sacrifice.\n74.\tIn entrusting to Mr. Kittani the guidance of this body, conceived as a forum for peace, the Assembly\nwished to indicate that discussion and dialog are the most effective means for resolving any conflicts that may arise between peoples of the world. War, that last hazardous and terrible recourse, leaves nothing in its wake but the grief of desolation and the always fearful danger of rancor. It is strange that, after so many and such long sufferings, the astonishing human intelligence has not been able to perceive such evident and tragic proof as that offered on every page of the book of history that there is no more fragile peace, no more precarious conquest, no less stable alliances, than those achieved amidst the roar of cannon and the sinister aegis of fire and sword. However, mankind, or at least a large part of it, continues to harbor its bloodstained illusions. As in barbarous times when private disputes were settled summarily by blows of the club, because there were no laws and none to apply them, no reason or justice which could prevail over force, and power was reduced to the naked exercise of violence, war continues to have a fatal attraction and fervent supporters. However, very little or nothing is resolved by those extremely costly and atrocious adventures, which inevitably begin as an exultant march from which, with no known exception, there returns a generation of young people, without any clear idea of what they were supposed to be doing on the battlefield, mutilated, angry and wasted, young people who would have better served their country and of course their own cause if they had been allowed to apply their strength and unbounded enthusiasm to less bloody undertakings.\n75.\tIt was precisely to prevent nations from coming to blows after the first disagreement or the first conflict and from turning disputes that could be discussed and settled into a catastrophe that, after many setbacks and great effort, international law was established. It was simply a matter of transferring to international relations the same rational mechanism as that which in the domestic jurisdiction had deprived those prepared to strike first, deal a cowardly blow, or hit hardest, of the ability to impose their will on others. If something as elementary but also as difficult as this i.e. that it is up to the laws and the interpreters of the laws, the mediators and the courts, to decide who was right in the innumerable disputes among citizens without waiting for them all to come to blows to establish who was in the right could prevail, of course with some regrettable exceptions, within countries, why not try the same on the international level? In the final analysis, if the experiment has been successful not without a certain amount of inevitable coercion among uncivilized and ignorant people who fought over land, water, cattle, and the right to survive and even the right to believe, to have opinions and to persuade others of the virtues of their beliefs and opinions, why should this not ( be applied in relations among nations, which are supposedly ruled by men and women who are more enlightened, wiser, and more sensible and farsighted?\n76.\tFor four centuries and even longer perhaps, jurists, theologians, statesmen and skilled diplomats, sophisticated or pragmatic, undertook the colossal task of convincing their peers throughout the world of the excellence of their project, and designing, and making acceptable to reluctant nationalism the institutions that would safeguard it. Its evolution was extremely slow, but the Very bestiality of war to which nations repeatedly resorted, attracted by profitable imperial trade, by simple vanity or\nby suspicion, or because the diabolical rhetoric of some delirious demagogue had razed the last barriers separating insanity from good-judgment imposed the need to come to terms before fighting, of talking before the wagons bristling with weapons crossed borders, before soldiers killed each other, before whole populations were senselessly destroyed and before women and children, who were taking no part in the storms of war, paid their tragic dues of hunger, death, pestilence and ruin, in settlement of the account for some senseless quarrel.\n77.\tWithout question, the Organization is the culmination of that long and arduous effort. As is stated in the Preamble to its Charter, it was created \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\". In a way, then, it is the tangible embodiment of that ecumenical humanitarian purpose: to avoid war and to convince nations that there are more civilized systems and certainly much more effective ones than those of general butchery in settling their pending affairs and even their grievances, which are generally the result of some other dispute for which no solution was found and which only brought out latent rancor:\n78.\tThat being the case, it seems to me that there can be no more appropriate forum or more responsive audience than this one for reference to a subject of concern to my Government: the obvious crisis in international law.\n79.\tWhile throughout the long period of its creation great and even malicious departures from it were used with notorious cynicism to justify wars of aggression and greedy acts of conquest, today's international community is based on the acceptance of certain fundamental basic rules, without which the maintenance of international peace and security is impossible. They are not many or very complicated, but they suffice to prevent the planet from becoming a vast pile of debris, if they are respected and not placed through cowardice or perhaps through chronic confusion in the deceitful hands of those who adhere to them without conviction, perversely and with suspect reservations. Those rules include: the sovereign equality of all nations, large and small; the seif-determination of peoples; the prohibition of interference in affairs essentially within the internal jurisdiction of States; the duty to comply in good faith with obligations stemming from treaties and other sources of international law; the obligation to settle international disputes by peaceful means; and the prohibition of any form of attack on the integrity or political independence of any State. Those norms, to be sure, were in large part incorporated into the Charter of the United Nations on the initiative of the Latin American countries, which for many years lived under the threat of foreign interference, from the dreadful punitive expeditions organized by the great Powers to cancel sometimes insignificant debts to their nationals, to the old and scandalous international trickery aimed at distorting the will of peoples or at nullifying it by placing at the head of Governments cruel, venal and greedy men, as obliging towards foreigners as they are merciless towards their own fellow-citizens.\n80.\tThe 51 original signatories of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the others which have joined the Organization in the course of its 35 years of existence, have willingly accepted those norms, and have solemnly pledged themselves not only to comply with them, bat also to create conditions in which justice, and respect among all the world's peoples, based firmly on those norms, may be reasonably expected to be maintained.\n81.\tThose principles and norms, along with international mores, judicial decisions and the doctrines of the most competent writers in the field, ate the essence of international law and govern the conduct of nations in their mutual relations* but they seem to have entered into a disquieting crisis, turning almost imperceptibly into a flexible catalog of amorphous solemnities, often used with unabashed cynicisnMo support the not always sound domestic objectives of some States and, on more occasions than we would like to admit, the blatant expansionism of others.\n82.\tThe traditional procedures for the peaceful settlement of dispute such as good offices, conciliation, arbitration and judicial settlement, which are enshrined, after visible compliance with ritual formalities, in many bilateral or multilateral instruments, are in the process of becoming laughable dead letters with no use other than serving as rhetorical disguise for manifest ill will. Some States, when they sign international agreements, skilfully maneuver to present themselves to the international community as standard bearers of principles in which they do not believe, principles which, in their domestic policies, they do not apply, or disregard, and which they would not hesitate to violate if, for any reason, they did not meet the interests of the Government in power, or of the system, or of the political ideology they attempt to impose and consolidate.\n83.\tAt times, they go to the extreme of using a change in regime as an argument of course, with no grounds in international law to support the denunciation of international territorial treaties, which are flawless and unassailable, and were agreed on years before and ratified in due form by the pertinent legislative powers. Faced with such serious evidence, one might say that we are going backwards to the uncertain and dangerous times when, with unheard of insolence and, of course, with distorted intentions, it was declared that treaties were nothing but meaningless pieces of paper.\n84.\tLaw, in any of its manifestations, is based on an elemental principle of good faith: without good faith, it is impossible, to govern mutual relations. At the domestic level, the great social pact which establishes a very subtle but valuable line between anarchy and harmony, is guaranteed by the restraining power inherent in the pact itself. But good will is essential, the conviction that only by heeding the laws and the principles which inspire them is it possible to build a disciplined, harmonious, equitable and sound society. Without this deep conviction that the law is necessary and valuable, and of course perfectible, although it imposes limits and constraints, is restrictive and sometimes unpleasant, no community of free men can exist. But even were a community temporarily to survive the insuperable challenge of its own disorder, it would not be respected, and all other communities would be wary of making agreements with it or trusting in its statements, however sensible they might be. Thus, if there is no intentional subjection to rules of conduct which are the same for all* there is no society, no credibility which could support it, ana no pact, contract or agreement of any kind which could be understood as having any qualities beyond those of improbable expectations.\n85.\tIn the international level, where this enforcement power does not exist, or exists vaguely and questionably, good faith, the sincere will to honor agreements, and not only formal adherence to them for the sake of appearances, can guarantee genuine lasting peace. Unfortunately, sufficient awareness of this unassailable fact does not always seem to exist. Furthermore, contrary to what one might logically expect, it is the weak countries, whose survival depends to a large extent on a strict body of norms which defend them against the arbitrary behavior of those stronger than they, that most frequently and lightly disregard them to attain casual advantages, not understanding that such behavior may then become a precedent to justify an illegal act against their own vital interests.\n86.\tAny devious interpretation of what should be a transparently clear explanation will turn against whoever makes it and set in motion his own downfall. To behave as though one believes that only what is in one's own interest is ethical exposes oneself to the calculated risk of leaving the fate of international harmony in the hands of the strongest or the least honest or a dangerous combination of the two.\n87.\tThe thorough and enlightened discussions of many complex issues which have taken place over the years and which are taking place here now, will be meaningless unless we all seek to bring about an effective return to faithful compliance with international law. The independence and self-determination of peoples will be nothing but empty words devoid of content if real or veiled intervention and in some cases actions which openly violate international law by some countries in the internal affairs of others, shielded behind pretexts and artificial considerations, are yet part of a clear political design. We have reached such, extremes of complacent complicity and unpardonable leniency in the application of international norms that there are those who do not consider as flagrant intervention cases of economic, political and even military support for minority groups which at times violently challenge the legitimate existence of Governments that are supported by large majorities. Others, as if it were an insignificant matter, allege that the supply of arms and military training to extremist organizations or terrorist groups (which act in the broad area of subversion with the open and declared purpose of destabilizing democratically constituted Governments and imposing by force on other countries the systems and ideologies that exist in the countries that assist and finance) does not constitute intervention or damage the juridical structure, which was so difficult to build and which is now threatened with destruction by the indifference of those who should be the most concerned by its gradual disappearance.\n88.\tOn the other hand, general and complete disarmament will continue to be not much more than an irrelevant item of academic discussion if, as could occur now, States do not have the opportunity of recourse to law to avert the risk of a real or imagined threat to the integrity and stability of their Governments. As long as the present alarming indifference exists regarding the fate of international law, there will always be justification for the acquisition of arms and for increasing the war potential. Even worse, it is possible that some who, for reasons of prestige or profit or with even less admissible motives, see a good opportunity to derive political or economic profit from a generalized arms race, are the same who promote such a state of affairs by advising their Governments that, instead of relying on the rules of treaties, they should resort to the insidious security of weapons to preserve the law, without actually having to fire those weapons.\n89.\tIf the full rule of law were restored, as it should be, it would not be necessary to affirm, as, unfortunately it too often is nowadays, that the only purpose of the arms race is the routine replacement of equipment, the search for a rational balance with other Powers or the natural defense of the country, since the juridical mechanism would suffice to cause any attempted aggression to be rejected immediately or to be heavily punished by the international community. But as long as that is not the position, on the pretext of the demands of national or even collective defense, enormous amounts will continue to be spent on sophisticated weapons, thus diverting those resources from development projects and the improvement of the general wellbeing.\n90.\tIf disregard of the norms of international law can bring about changes with unforeseeable consequences in the field of political relations, the same is true in the field of international economic relations. What is required there and perhaps with the same urgency is not only a substantive review but also the full restoration of the compulsory nature of international agreements and strict respect for their provisions.\n91.\tWe have had seven years without practical results of the commitment to establish a new international economic order; five years without implementation of the Integrated program for Commodities; more than 15 years of sterility and despair in the implementation of the agreements in principle of the law of the sea; and more than two years to begin a modest cycle of global negotiations. Those are only some indications, in my view serious ones, of what may await mankind in the future if we do not counter weakness, reluctance, lack of responsibility and negligence with a firm decision to respect our agreements.\n92.\tI believe that we are passing the limits of credibility. Organizations such as this one and those associated with it, but not ensuring respect for agreements, run the risk of being replaced by structures which respond better to the aspirations of the international community. It is unnecessary to. state what a backward step it would be in the search for understanding among nations if that were to occur. But unfortunately that will be the case if decisions, agreements, rules and settlements are not strictly and promptly implemented or respected. What we are witnessing with increasing concern is a scandalous succession of acts which directly or indirectly infringe the norms which protect justice by means of the law in the field of international relations. Diplomatic prerogatives, which were formally agreed to or which have been accepted for centuries to facilitate normal communications among Governments, are brazenly violated: Juridical mandates are being disregarded and trampled underfoot, mandates which translate the principle of nonintervention proclaimed in conclusive terms by the General Assembly in its Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty, adopted unanimously in 1965 [resolution 2131 (XX)]. There is open violation of the principle of nonaggression by means of armed attacks which are completely unjustified and which treacherously violate the provisions of Chapter VII cf the Charter. There is scandalous mockery of decisions of the International Court of Justice, the highest court of the world, the judicial body of the Organization, and of other international institutions. The obligation to resort to the procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for in Chapter VI of the Charter and in other multilateral and bilateral conventions is not respected. The duties relative to the protection of human rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and in agreements emerging from competent bodies of international organizations are ignored. Foreign territory is invaded unilaterally and with complete disregard of the most elementary legal principles. In practice, the principles of the equal rights of States and the self-determination of peoples are repudiated. Even in those fields; which most obviously call for the universal cooperation of nations, such cooperation is denied, although it would be beneficial to all if everybody contributed to the preparation of and respect for the relevant conventions.\n93.\tLet us think for a moment of the consequences of a possible final and total disruption of the legal norms on which is based the operation of international organizations, the continual activities of which guarantee the functioning of the various sectors of what could be termed international public administration. The disappearance of those bodies, the existence of which we have come to consider natural, would mean a world without postal services, telecommunications, international civil aviation, economic or financial cooperation among States, meteorological data from outside national boundaries, preventive measures against the spread of global epidemics, without the means of continuing, promoting and increasing world food production, without action or joint guidelines in the field of education or labor, without the possibility of maintaining scientific and cultural exchanges, without stimulus for the support and progress of maritime navigation, without cooperation in the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, without a network of international intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations dealing with the most varied needs of peoples at the international level, without international commerce; in a word, without any trade at all, since the least trade presupposes the existence of rules governing it.\n94.\tColombia, which prides itself above all on its respect for law, can therefore not ignore such an alarming situation. It is to the crisis in international law and the lack of interest shown in it that we attribute phenomena that have created tremendous tension and that will probably bring about untold calamities in the community of nations.\n95.\tThe presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, despite the reiterated appeals made by the Organization to guarantee to those countries the right to self-determination, is nothing but one more example  and, of course, one of the most disquieting of the casual attitude of some nations to the civilized practice of\ninternational law. If in the future somewhere else in the world another invasion occurs there is no doubt that a good part of the responsibility for that nefarious act will rest with those who seem unaware of the importance of the full application of international legal norms.\n96.\tSomething similar could be said about one of the most offensive and abhorrent violations of the dignity of the human person racial discrimination. Colombia, which has traditionally been a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia,, has always rejected and continues vigorously to reject apartheid. It also considers that the fate of the Territory should be determined by its inhabitants, without the intervention or support of foreign Powers, In keeping with this position, it considers that the Government of South Africa has an inescapable obligation to bring about the independence of Namibia and not put obstacles in the way of its legitimate claim to self-government.\n97.\tMy country is of course aware of the general concern at the situation in the Middle East which has been further complicated by the assassination of President Anwar El Sadat. We welcomed the dialog that made possible peace between Egypt and Israel and the agreements that were the happy result of that splendid gesture of conciliation and goodwill. That is why, as a contribution to peace in the Middle East, Colombia has decided to take part in the multinational force which will guarantee the demilitarization of the Sinai Peninsula. My country would like to see a similar climate prevail with regard to the definitive solution of the Palestinian problem, which certainly cannot be solved without the participation of the legitimate representatives of that people.\n98.\tIn the continuous process of the legal codification of relations among States and between geography and man there is a field that is still subject to rules of law that are inadequate and reflect the unfairness of the relations of force which led to their adoption. I am referring to the regime which exists for outer space and the geostationary synchronous orbit.\n99.\tThat orbit is a Scarce resource and should not be allocated on the basis of the excessive advantages that the unequal development of technology offers to a very small number of States. This points to the advisability of convening an international conference for the purpose of filling the gaps in the treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies [resolution 222 (XXI)] and elaborating a proper law of space, consistent, equitable and harmonious.\n100.\tEquatorial countries have already begun an international debate on the geostationary synchronous orbit, a debate that has shown the gaps in that Treaty and has enabled peoples of the third world to begin to see how a vital element of contemporary civilization, satellite communications, is becoming the object of a process of increased monopolization. That is why we must legally distinguish the geostationary synchronous orbit from the amorphous concept of outer space. In that essential task developing countries must promote an international, legal order which, responding to the legitimate rights of equatorial States, will regulate the use of the orbit bearing in mind the common interest of mankind.\n101.\tMy country and other equatorial States would not find it at all satisfactory if, in the absence of the legal reforms that have been recommended, third world peoples 10 or 20 years hence, in order to free themselves from the subjection and inequality created in space, had to fight from a position of disadvantage and face serious faits accomplis, as is the case today in connection with the international economic order. By then it will nor be easy to achieve a new international legal order in space, just as it is now difficult to achieve a new international economic order.\n102.\tI belong to a country which believes more in the force of law than in the force of arms; which admires more the quiet labor of jurists than the clamor and arrogant ostentation of strong men; which has created a civilized society that respects the popular will and is peaceful and republican. All those Circumstances, together with the disquiet that we experience owing to the progressive deterioration of a true international legal order, have led me to put before the General Assembly a subject which may not have the same apparent topicality as others which have properly been dealt with here. But I would say that it is perhaps in the ostensible breach in international law that we may find the origin of our many present tribulations and of those that will undoubtedly follow if we do not act courageously to restore what we have left to fade and languish through our negligence, in our improvident hands.\n103.\tWere international law to disappear and were organizations such as this one, where dialog is still possible, to remain as another monument to the futility of our efforts to make reason prevail over unbridled force, humanity would have unwittingly entered into a new dark age. But if, on the contrary, we persevere in the worthwhile task of replacing the ferocious code of war by a judicious and thoughtful code of agreements, against all forecasts we shall have done more lasting work for peace than that resulting from the precarious and sombre balance of terror. If we are to coexist, as we must, at least as long as the planet tolerates us and provides for us, it will not be as the result of a sterile, inclement and ruinous play of mistrust, shock and contained violence. Let us seek, as so many before us, the best of the species, have done successfully, an intelligent framework of impersonal and abstract laws so that our strong aspiration to peace may not be frustrated by the merciless and fateful law of the jungle.\n"

        "file_text": "I am especially pleased to convey to you, Mr. President, the wannest congratulations of the Government of Chile on your election as President of this thirty- sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election constitutes a tribute to your brilliant diplomatic experience and recognized personal merits.\n82.\tI wish at the same time to express to your predecessor, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, our appreciation for the able and calm manner in which he presided over the last session, demonstrating his outstanding professional skill.\n83.\tWe also wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his devoted and tireless efforts in the difficult task of advancing the work of the Organization in attaining its goal of peace.\n84.\tWe extend a warm welcome to the Republic of Vanuatu, a nation in the Pacific Ocean and to which we therefore feel close ties of solidarity. We are also pleased to see Belize join the United Nations. Our ties with that State are even closer, because of its geographical location and our common interests. We feel certain that these new Members will enrich the Organization and contribute to it vitality and renewed strength.\n85.\tthirty-six years ago, in San Francisco, my country joined in the great task of laying the foundations of the Organization, designed to preserve international peace and security, the prerequisites for a just and lasting world order. Chile could not remain indifferent to the aspirations of an entire generation and its right to grow and develop in a climate of peace and mutual trust.\n86.\tThe widespread crisis in which the world was engulfed at that time compelled the peoples to reaffirm their faith in the individual and prompted them to commit themselves to creating the necessary conditions for full human development. Hence, the Charter of the United Nations begins by reaffirming, among other things, the faith of the peoples in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the promotion of social progress and better standards of life \\\"in larger freedom\\\".\n87.\tCognizant of this responsibility, the Government of Chile is exerting its efforts to achieve true order at home through the development of all the various spheres of national life.\n88.\tTowards that same end, Chile is striving to achieve the highest level of friendly relations with other nations, based on respect for the principles of sovereign rights of States and\nself-determination of peoples.\n89.\tIn 1981, Chile has been going through a highly significant stage in its history. Full of optimism and with renewed hope, we Chileans are today working towards the consolidation in our country of an authentically free society and of a modern infrastructure capable of ensuring effective social peace and a stable and sustained economic development.\n90.\tAs I stated at the thirty-fifth session [17th meeting] from this rostrum, the Chilean people sovereignly and freely approved, on 11 September 1980, a new political constitution, a juridical instrument designed to permit the reinforcement of the foundations of a solid democracy, capable of surviving the threat stemming from totalitarian doctrines which seek to gain power by every means possible and which consequently lead to the destruction of the democratic system.\n91.\tThe new fundamental charter of Chile entered into force on 11 March 1981, the date of the assumption of an eight-year term of office by the President of the Republic, General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte.\n92.\tThus, a new stage in the history of Chile has begun, demonstrating to the world my country's institutional progress. The Government has thus kept its promise to the people to establish a new political, economic and social institutional order which, along with eradicating the danger of a totalitarian menace, will allow the country to advance into the future in order and progress.\n93.\tThe intrinsic dignity of man, his essential equality and his autonomy vis-a-vis the power of the State constitute permanent principles of my Government. The political, social and economic consequences of these principles have not only enabled the restoration of peaceful and harmonious life in Chile but have also the reinforcement of freedom and a spectacular economic revival.\n94.\tThe task has not been easy, nor has it been free of sacrifices and hardship, inasmuch as the deep crisis which Chile suffered could only be overcome thanks to the greatest efforts on the part of its people and Government.\n95.\tIn the socioeconomic field, the present policy has been directed essentially towards the achievement of three broad objectives: the attainment, within a free economic program, of a high and sustained level of economic growth; the strengthening of individual freedom in all its social aspects; and finally, the eradication Of extreme poverty and the subhuman conditions which afflicted almost a fourth of the Chilean population.\n96.\tWith regard to economic growth, it should be pointed out that Chile's gross national product increased at an average annual rate of 7.2 per cent between 1976 and 19\u00a70. This figure exceeds the percentage recorded for any other five- year period in the history of our country.\n97.\tThis growth has encouraged the creative initiative of the private sector, which is an essential factor in development, with the State playing a subsidiary role, as it should by its very nature. This is demonstrated by the fact.that while in the early 1970s private investment represented only 25.3 per cent of total investment, in 1980 it accounted for 6*7.3 per cent.\n98.\tDuring the last five years the balance of payments has constantly been positive, thus allowing for the reserves in our monetary system to be increased from $400 million in 1973 to $4.7 billion in 1980.\n99.\tOur nontraditional exports increased during that same period by 800 per cent, thus substantially contributing to a reduction in our historical dependence on sales of copper abroad.\n100.\tFinally, discipline in public expenditure and the monetary policy adopted have enabled Chile to reduce its annual rate of inflation from 1,000 per cent in 1973 to approximately 12 per cent, the figure anticipated for this year.\n101.\tAs I have stated, one of my Government's principal objectives is to defeat extreme poverty and misery. To summarize in figures social expenditure, that is, the allotment of Government resources to health, nutrition, housing and education, almost 50 per cent of the total public expenditure in the last few years has been applied to such programs. In 1981 public expenditure amounted to 53.6 per cent and had contributed, inter alia, to a significant reduction in the infant mortality rate.\n102.\tFinally, we have stepped up efforts to create new employment and this has resulted in a remarkable reduction of the unemployment rate, which in early 1976 had reached 19.8 per cent and has today been reduced to 8.4 per cent of the active population, despite the fact that the latter has far exceeded previous levels in Chile.\n103.\tIn carrying out this task, some of the results of which we have pointed out, it was necessary to make an internal adjustment in order to transfer to the free price system the Orientation of decisions on investment, thus neutralizing the historical role of the State in making such decisions. This adjustment was met with difficulties and strong pressure from various quarters, both domestic and foreign, designed to disrupt its application. However, the great majority of the people supports my Government's economic program, as is evidenced by the approval by over 67 per cent of the people of the new political constitution which, among its provisions, consecrates the principles of freedom, justice, progress and national security which have inspired current social and economic policies.\n104.\tOur country is convinced that the application of policies of internal adjustment is always difficult, regardless of whatever government regime is in power. However, our experience reveals that if such policies are conducted coherently and without hesitation, positive results, along with the people's support, can always be expected.\n105.\tI have briefly analyzed some results of the social and economic process in our country because the adjustments made have enabled us to expand our development and to maintain a sustained increase in our contribution to much needed international cooperation.\n106.\tIndeed, Chile's foreign trade with an increasing number of countries with different economic systems today accounts for 43.7 per cent of its gross national product, which has turned our country into an attractive market for the international community, since the latter's imports from Chile will amount to $7 billion in 1981, an increase of 400 per cent in the last eight years.\n107.\tMy Government believes that favorable conditions prevail in our country to contribute to promoting the economy of other States by ensuring employment and outlets for their respective domestic products. This reveals our increasing contribution to the necessary and desirable interdependence which should exist among economies at the international level and which is unfortunately being threatened by the resurgence of protectionism that can be seen in many countries. We believe that this protectionism can only aggravate the domestic problems of the countries which practice it, because they yield to pressure groups that have ceased to be competitive and thus impede one of the most equitable ways of transferring resources to developing countries, namely, international trade.\n108.\tIn accordance with the provisions of our political constitution and in compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, the Government of Chile has continued to exert its efforts to achieve the highest level of friendly relations with other nations, based on respect for the principles of equality, sovereignty, independence and nonintervention in internal affairs.\n109.\tIn conformity with our historic vocation, priority is assigned in this regard to the special ties which link us with the American continent. Thus, the objectives pursued were not only aimed at strengthening our bilateral relations with neighboring countries and other nations of the region, but Chile has also pursued a continental consensus to unify our position with respect to the important matter of security and cooperation in the hemisphere, today threatened by the destabilizing force of SovietCuban expansion.\n110.\tIn the neighboring area, the Government has continued to exert its efforts towards reaching a solution to our differences with Argentina in the south. Following a number of meetings in the course of which the parties submitted their respective positions to a mediator, the\nSovereign Pontiff called a meeting in Rome on 12 De\t'\ncember 1980 with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Chile and Argentina and at a solemn ceremony submitted a proposal which he himself deemed to be just, equitable and honorable. While the terms of the proposal made by the Sovereign Pontiff did not frlly satisfy Chile's aspirations, my Government decided to accept it, in view of the involvement of the highest moral authority on earth, and it so informed the Holy Father on 25 December 1980.\n111.\tMy country, by accepting the terms of the Pontiffs proposal once again demonstrated its trust in the Sovereign Pontiff's efforts towards peace and justice. This attitude also implied Chile's unwavering respect for the international commitments it has undertaken and its attachment to the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes, deeply convinced, as we are, that such principles constitute the essential grounds for harmonious and peaceful coexistence among States.\n112.\tAs a result of successful negotiations with the Government of Peru, our relations with that sister republic have been restored at the highest level, with the appointment of ambassadors at Lima and Santiago.\n113.\tThe traditional friendship between Brazil and Chile was given renewed impetus on the occasion of the visit to our country by the President of Brazil, Mr. Jpao Baptista Figueiredo, towards the end of 1980, during which the heads of State of both Governments signed an important joint declaration and agreements on cooperation and other matters of mutual interest.\n114.\tWe should also emphasize the excellent relations with Colombia, as shown by high-level official visits and the signing of cooperation agreements between our two countries.\n115.\tOur ties with Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela have also developed harmoniously as is demonstrated by our friendly relations with those sister countries.\n116.\tFollowing the conflict which broke out early this year between the Republics of Ecuador and Peru, we were asked to join with Argentina, Brazil and the United States of America as friendly countries and as guarantors of the PeruvianEcuadorian Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Frontiers, signed at Rio de Janeiro on 29 January 1942 to seek a just and speedy solution to the question. The action of the four countries referred to who acted at every stage by consensus made possible negotiations between the parties, which earned the recognition of the Presidents of Ecuador and Peru. We are proud to have contributed to restoring harmony between two brother countries with which we have traditional ties of friendship.\n117.\tAnother significant landmark is the favorable development of our relations with the United States of America, as evidenced by the exchange of visits to our country and the United States by distinguished representatives of the Government, the armed forces, business and other sectors, which has revealed an ample convergence of views regarding bilateral, regional and international cooperation.\n118.\tWe must point out our permanent interest in the situation in Central America and the Caribbean. Chile is opposed to foreign intervention in the internal affairs of those countries. We condemn subversion and terrorism as a means of penetration, and Chile cannot but regret, together with the great majority of the countries of our continent, the FrancoMexican declaration on El Salvador.4 Chile reiterates its belief that it is for the Salvadorean people alone to decide on their destiny in accordance with their full right to  self-determination.\n119.\tOur links with Western Europe have always been significant for Chilean foreign policy. Among the most favorable events of recent months have been the solution of the abnormal situation affecting our relations with Italy and the remarkable increase in commercial exchange with the great majority of countries in that region. As an example, it should be emphasized that trade with the Federal Republic of Germany reached a figure of $1 billion in 1980.\n120.\tWe have promoted active diplomatic action in the Ear East, with the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations [ASEAN] and with those of the Pacific in general, and we have strengthened our ties with the People's Republic of China. Strong evidence of this is provided by the fruitful visit to Chile in April of this year by the ViceMinister of Foreign Affairs of China, Mr. Zhang Wenjin, and the signing of an important agreement last June. As a result of that same action, there has been a substantial increase in the value of trade with Japan, which this year will exceed $1.3 billion.\n121.\tWe have also strengthened commercial and political ties with the countries of SouthEast Asia, and we have opened an embassy in Thailand, in addition to the embassies previously established in the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia.\n122.\tAs regards our policy of opening up towards the Pacific, we would point to the establishment of diplomatic relations with the island States of Kiribati and Nauru, as well as the growing participation by Chile in various forums dealing with matters of regional interest. In this connection, it is worth mentioning the offer made by our country, at a meeting of the Planning Committee of the South Pacific Commission, of an overall technical assistance program in the area.\n123.\tAs regards our relations with the countries of the Middle East, besides the high level of our relations with many of them, we should point out as a significant event the establishment of new resident missions in lUnisia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\n124.\tOur ties with the African nations have been intensified more and more by the exchange of visits, by the establishment of mixed commissions, and by signing numerous agreements on technical, cultural and scientific assistance, as recently occurred with Zaire and Equatorial Guinea.\n125.\tIn our relations with Africa we have not neglected cooperation on the tragic problem of refugees, not only by means of a small material contribution through UNHCR, but also by a proposal for technical assistance.\n126.\tMy Government cannot omit the expression of its deep concern over the explosive international situation now affecting mankind. We have witnessed a confusion of values, in many instances contempt for human beings, deception of entire populations and disregard of various fundamental principles. And of late we have seen an increase in tension, which constitutes an undoubted threat to peace. This is the only way in which we can evaluate the military invasions, the outbreak of new conflicts, the use of subversion as a means of political and ideological penetration, the use of force in international relations, and the continuing increase in terrorism.\n127.\tOn the pretext of ensuring peaceful coexistence the Soviet Union has sent its troops into Afghanistan and has used one of its satellites in SouthEast Asia, causing the oppression of an entire nation and one of the most tragic exoduses in history. It has used another of its allies first to penetrate, then to confuse and finally to act in Central America by means of subversion and terrorism. It has resorted to every means to create and encourage antagonisms in an effort to benefit its own cause. In addition, it has spread confusion and uncertainty by means of dialectics which destroy established values.\n128.\tThose of us who are convinced of the need for respect for the human person and for human dignity, who firmly believe in freedom of the individual and of nations, in independence, equality and\n self-determination for all peoples, must raise our voices and unite our efforts in order to prevent confusion and weakness allowing the indefinite and unjust progress of such imperialistic action. 'We believe that the time has come for all of us who identify with the authentic purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations to defend them frankly and openly, with the firmness that stems from conviction, by denouncing their violation wherever it occurs and by requesting and supporting application of the sanctions against transgressors which the Organization itself provides for.\n129.\tTherefore, we must openly denounce the case of Afghanistan, a country which was invaded by military force almost two years ago. Approximately 2,500,000 of its nationals have had to seek refuge in Pakistan, through that country's generosity and the contribution of the special fund for refugees from Afghanistan, which my country has supported.\n130.\tAnother typical example of the use of force in international relations is the case of Kampuchea. Over 200,000 Vietnamese soldiers have attacked that country and are continually threatening its immediate neighbors. Chile condemns this outright aggression and fully supports the initiative of the ASEAN countries aimed at restoring peace and goodwill in SouthEast Asia after so many years of suffering.\n131.\tThe tragedy in that part of the world is also evidenced by the millions of refugees who, in fragile boats, continue their search in other lands for the freedom of which they have been deprived. The United Nations should continue to give its full support to efforts to alleviate the terrible suffering of the IndoChinese refugees.\n132.\tUnfortunately, the use of force or the threat of use of force is not limited only to the aforementioned cases; it is also evident in Poland, with characteristics which remind us of other tragic interventions on the old continent. It is also found in the Middle East, in Africa and even in Latin America, where it is revealed in interventions and threats, especially in some Central American countries, such as El Salvador.\n133.\tMy country notes this situation with special concern in regard to the Middle East, not only because it affects world peace but also because we feel very close to the peoples that live in that tormented region. Many of the children of those countries have become Chilean citizens, and we feel with them whenever peace is disrupted in those countries, with the terrible sequel of bloodshed and poverty.\n134.\tIn particular, we have followed with deep concern the tragedy of the peoples of Lebanon, torn by bloody struggles which have devastated a once-prosperous nation. We hope that peace and calm will soon be restored in Lebanon and we support the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations, which have helped to mitigate the escalation of hostilities.\n135.\tOnce again, we wish to reiterate that Chile believes that a realistic solution to the problem of the Middle East should be based on the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories, on the acknowledgment of the right of all the States in that region including Israel, of course to live within secure and internationally recognized frontiers and on the full exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to  self-determination in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and especially those of the Security Council.\n136.\tWith regard to Namibia, the Government of Chile believes that the efforts of the international community, and especially of the United Nations, should continue in order to find a negotiated solution to this colonial issue. In this regard, Chile, as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, supports resolution 435 (1978) and others adopted by the Security Council.\n137.\tLikewise, we reaffirm our denunciation of the policy of apartheid, because it constitutes a violation not only of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations but also of the very foundations of respect for human rights, regardless of creed, race or nationality.\n138.\tChile, as a peace-loving country, encourages and favors any initiatives which make possible the peaceful settlement of disputes. Therefore, with regard to Cyprus, we endorse the suggestion that has been put forward that the question be dealt with as events and negotiations develop.\n139.\tSimilarly, we believe that the good offices of the Secretary-General to reach a solution on the issue of the unification of Korea through dialog between the North and the South will contribute to the general stability of that region.\n140.\tWe have referred to the commitment of all of us who belong to the Organization not only to respect the human person as such but also to promote the establishment of conditions in which justice and respect for the obligations assumed by States may be preserved.\n141.\tTwo items on the agenda refer specifically to these matters: terrorism, which constitutes one of the most cowardly and cruel attacks against human beings, and disarmament. Unless disarmament is negotiated in good faith the conditions of justice and peace which we are committed to establish will be difficult to achieve.\n142.\tWe attach special importance to the problem of terrorism, the escalation of which constitutes a very serious threat to the internal peace of States and a flagrant breach of the most elementary human rights. We have, therefore, lent our firm support to all those internationally agreed upon measures which seek effectively to counteract this despicable and criminal method of political struggle.\n143.\tWhile the paramount obligation to put an end to this phenomenon rests with Governments, we believe that theire is an international responsibility on all States to prohibit the promotion or encouragement in their territories of terrorist activities in other regions, and to punish those who commit or back up such criminal acts.\n144.\tAnother matter which is unquestionably topical is the subject of disarmament, which is dealt with by the General Assembly year after year. While we admit that some progress has been achieved to halt the arms race, we regret that results have been few so far. Our traditionally peace-loving country has always proclaimed, both on a regional and on a worldwide level, its firm adherence to the principles of total disarmament, which is the heartfelt aspiration of the international community.\n145.\tThe Government of Chile believes that the internal effort required from the developing countries should be complemented by international cooperation. Therefore Chile is confident that in the near future the path will be traced towards the launching of the global negotiations, as they are called, which perhaps at this time constitute the only initiative towards the attainment of an adjustment in international economic relations.\n146.\tIf those negotiations are really expected to represent a vigorous contribution to cooperation efforts, it is indispensable that they be launched in the framework of the Organization so as to receive the full backing of the whole international community. At the same time, it appears indispensable for the different groups engaged in this work to make a serious analysis in an effort to unify viewpoints regarding such problems as the program of work or those of an institutional nature which have so far paralyzed talks. This task requires not only a high degree of political will on the part of the developed countries, thus giving effect to their frequent statements in this regard, but also the necessary high principles, clarity of concepts and clear language on the part of the countries constituting the Group of 77, which should agree to a larger degree of realism in their demands.\n147.\tMeanwhile the efforts towards SouthSouth cooperation have been revived; they were initiated by the developing countries themselves. This constitutes a highly favorable factor, which found its most concrete expression in the High Level Conference OP Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held recently at Caracas, where a complete program for horizontal cooperation was drawn up. This task is strongly supported by Chile.\n148.\tIn the area of scientific cooperation, we are witnesses of the progress being achieved year by year for the benefit of all mankind.\n149.\tAs far as outer space is concerned, the extremely rapid development of technology in that sector compels us to establish with great urgency legal principles to govern all activity. This task is being performed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, of which Chile is a member. However, further impetus should be given to this task in order to prevent space technology from being applied before the legal norms which should regulate its use, and clearly define responsibilities, are laid down. We hope that a study on the military use of outer space will now be initiated, either in that Committee itself or in the Committee on Disarmament, depending on the decision of the General Assembly. We believe that this is an urgent task which brooks no further delay.\n150.\tOne of the major negotiations carried out under the auspices of the Organization is undoubtedly the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, both because of its great contribution to the progressive development of international law, as contemplated in the Charter, in regulating the use of more than two thirds of the planet, and because of its remarkable contribution to the work of international forums in general by perfecting an operative method of consensus among almost 160 participating States. It is a matter of satisfaction to the world, and especially to Chile, a law abiding maritime country, that next year the immense efforts that have been exerted will culminate in the adoption of a single convention of a universal nature enjoying the consensus of the international community. To that end, we call upon all States to step up their negotiating efforts and upon all the parties involved to so demonstrate the necessary flexibility with regard to the great objectives pursued, without altering the essence of the draft convention.\n151.\tA moment ago I mentioned the profound concern of the Government of Chile over the international situation at present facing mankind. It was also clearly stated that unfortunately the Organization had not responded fully to the efforts of those who created it in the hope of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. As the Secretary-General warned us not long ago, we are closer than ever before to the danger of world confrontation [see AI36/1, sect. XIII].\n152.\tWe believe that the time has come as in 1945  for Member States of the United Nations to renew their profession of faith in the authentic values of man and society. Only firm convictions and fortitude in the struggle to achieve a just international order can lead to the attainment of the supreme objective, peace. The Charter itself reveals to us that peace and security cannot be achieved unless there is effective international cooperation in solving economic, social, scientific and cultural problems.\n153.\tChile realizes that States, both individually and collectively, should now back up with deeds their professions of profound and sincere willingness to use the United Nations as an instrument for authentic and active cooperation.\n154.\tIn their magnitude and scope, the problems facing mankind today are largely international in nature. Therefore, their solution depends on the concerted efforts of all', large and small, to fulfill the noble task of creating a better world for our children and for generations to come.\n155.\tFrom this lofty rostrum Chile ratifies its decision to continue its unflagging struggle for the noble principles and ideals which gave birth to the United Nations in 1945.\n"

        "file_text": "68.\tFirst of all, Sir, I should like to congratulate you and your country upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session.\n69.\tBoth your diplomatic talents and your great knowledge of the workings of this institution enable us to look forward to a satisfactory outcome of our work. It does not seem to me superfluous to emphasize this, because this year again, to the great disappointment of many Member States which' cherish peace and justice, we have seen the Organization's Security Council founder lamentably in its work because of its having been diverted from its objectives of peace by the abuse of the right of veto by certain permanent members.\n70.\tThat is why, faithful to its traditions, the General Assembly must continue to be a place of freedom and the privileged forum for the full and complete participation of all peoples in the affairs of the world. The fact that you, Sir, are in charge of our proceedings can only be a guarantee of that. My delegation, then, will consider it its duty to cooperate fully with you in the fulfillment of the important tasks entrusted to you.\n71.\tWe should like also to thank Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar for his competent leadership of the work of the thirty-fifth session of the Assembly which has just come to an end, and to express our gratitude to the Secretary\nGeneral who for years has shown skill and devotion in the service of the Organization.\n72.\tFinally, it is with a sense of great pleasure that my delegation congratulates the Republic of Vanuatu. The people of the Seychelles followed with attention and interest the struggle of that brother people of the Islands for its independence and for the protection of its territorial integrity. We were struck by its drive and tenacity, and now we cannot but be delighted at the presence of this young State in our Organization.\n73.\tLast year when we spoke during the general debate [6th meeting], we considered a number of matters, both economic and political, which afflict and often paralyze countries, particularly our countries of the third world. This year we are in fact faced with those same matters, to which others have been added. Unfortunately, it seems that no major steps have been taken towards concrete solutions. Further, one cannot fail to note the disturbing nature of this situation: at a time when more and more meetings are being held throughout the world in the collective, sincere search for solutions to our many problems, we are witnessing a steady deterioration of international relations attributable to a clear lack of will on the part of certain Powers resolutely and calmly to confront the great problems of the day, that is, those concerning peace, security and development.\n74.\tIn their relations with others, certain Powers seem to have deliberately opted for the language of threats, provocation, and even aggression, in contempt of the most elementary principles of coexistence between States. They brandish in the face of the world their nuclear strike forces and their neutron bomb, and they parade their military arsenal at the very door of others as though this were not a tragic threat to security, peace or the lives of millions of people.\n75.\tDespite that disturbing state of affairs, my delegation is pleased to make a statement during this debate precisely because we wish to underscore how important it is to oppose any behavior based on domination and aggression in international relations, because we believe that the right to a better future is an imprescriptible right of all peoples without exception; and because we know that despite everything the forces of progress, throughout the world, continue to develop and bonds of solidarity to be forged with a view to building that future of justice, peace and wellbeing.\n76.\tIt is only normal that we should begin by turning to the question of decolonization. While it is independent, my country knows that its own progress is essentially linked to the disappearance of every form of colonial or neo-colonial relations between States. That is why it is seeking tirelessly to intensify its solidarity with all the brother peoples which are still fighting in the field against colonialism: the peoples of Namibia, Western' Sahara, South Africa, Palestine, East Timor, Puerto Rico and others,\n77.\tA year ago, for example, we were convinced that the peoples of Namibia and Western Sahara were on the point of gaining their independence, the occupying Powers having finally agreed to face the facts and release their grip over those Territories.\n78. Unfortunately, we were disappointed, and we know why.\n79. With respect, first of all, to Namibia, the Piling minority of Pretoria is bent on continuing its plunder of that Territory. It is also determined to continue to use it as a rampart and a base in its policy of supremacy in the region, so as to establish firmly its own oppressive and cruel regime in South Africa. And other Western countries, headed today by the United States, are equally determined to continue the exploitation of the Territory as well as its strategic use in their will to gain military supremacy at any cost.\n80.\tFrom the adoption of General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI) in. 1966 to the convening of the Security Council from 21 to 30 April 1981 on the question of Namibia, our Organization has tried everything without achieving the desired results. It has now declared itself by a great majority, during the emergency special session of the General Assembly, clearly in favor of the armed struggle being waged by the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] against the Pretoria regime [resolution ES8/2]. Towards this end, it has appealed to brother countries to provide material and military assistance to SWAPO and to the front-line countries on an urgent basis.\n81.\tMy delegation can only subscribe to this once again, in the hope that this last attempt will make it possible for Namibia to attain independence in keeping with the United Nations plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It goes without saying that any collective sanctions we agree to impose in concrete terms against the Pretoria regime can only accelerate the process of independence for Namibia.\n82.\tWith regard to Namibia, we cannot fail to mention the brother people of South Africa who, under the heroic leadership of the African National Congress, are also continuing their struggle against the same oppressive and barbaric colonial regime of Pretoria.\n83. Once again, we condemn the blind policy of that regime which, on the pretext of protecting Christian civilization and through the practice of racism, apartheid and bantustanization, is perpetuating the exploitation of the labor force of the South African people by a minority closely linked to international capitalism whose interests it defends.\n84.\tSince its assumption of power on 5 June 1977, the Government of President France Albert Rene has, within the limits of its modest capacities, taken concrete measures of reprisal against the Pretoria regime. In this, context, my delegation calls for the strict implementation of Security Council resolutions 417 (1977) and 418 (1977), the latter of which calls for the immediate cessation of the provision to South Africa of arms and related material of all types and of any cooperation with South Africa in the manufacture and development of nuclear weapons; as well as of General Assembly resolution 35/206 which, among other things, refers to the situation in South Africa, the imposition of comprehensive sanctions and an oil embargo, and the harmful role of transnational corporations.\n85.\tThe Pretoria regime manages to survive thanks to its relations not only with Israel but with many other States\nMembers of our Organization. We therefore realize that where those States are concerned all our resolutions remain a dead letter, and we find this regrettable.\n86.\tHowever, it is comforting to note that the hardworking people of South Africa, albeit excessively exploited, constitute the sole historic strength of that country, and we continue to be convinced that, with the active solidarity of other brother peoples, they will triumph.\n87.\tIn this regard, we should like to congratulate the people of Angola and their Government, which have played a decisive role in support of the liberation movements of southern Africa, particularly SWAPO, at an immense cost in human life and material damage.\n88.\tWe regret that the Security Council has once again failed in its mission by refusing to condemn the South African aggression against Angola owing to the veto of the United States. We are also aware, however, that Angola needs, in addition to the moral support which the international community owes it, also material assistance. We hope that the United Nations will see to it that when a breach of the peace occurs, Angola will, within the framework of General Assembly resolution 377 (V), benefit as rapidly as possible from the material and military assistance of Member States. That assistance was called for at the emergency special session on Namibia and by the Heads of State of the frontline States meeting in Lagos on 11 September. ^\n89.\tWith regard to the Sahraoui people, we believe that during the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] held at Nairobi in June 1981, and at the most recent meeting of that Organization's Implementation Committee, Morocco agreed to the early holding of a free and general referendum in exercise of the right to self-determination in Western Sahara under the supervision of the OAU and the United Nations. My delegation welcomes this development and my country will continue to make its humble contribution to the establishment of a just and lasting peace in that part of Africa, in keeping with OAU resolutions and with Genera! Assembly resolutions 34/37 and 35/19.\n90.\tIn line with the goal of decolonization which we have set for ourselves is the question of Palestine, which has been before the General Assembly for many years and which concerns the exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their \\\"right of return and their right to self-determination, national independence and sovereignty in Palestine\\\". We detect a growing awareness of those rights at the international level. However, this awareness continues to be countered by Israel which, like its ally in Pretoria, defies international public opinion and the numerous resolutions of our Organization with impunity. Like South Africa and, needless to say, with its assistance, the Zionist entity, not satisfied with occupying Palestinian and Arab territories, including Jerusalem, has embarked upon acts of aggression against such neighboring territories as Lebanon and Iraq designed to establish its own military supremacy in the area\u2014acts of aggression to which we shall return in due course.\n91.\tThe General Assembly, at its thirty-fifth session [resolution 351169 A], once again endorsed the recommendations of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and called upon Israel to respect those rights. We all, alas, know the result. It is clear that in the case of Israel we are caught in the same toils as we are in the case of South Africa. In other words, because of the many kinds of complicity between Zionism and apartheid, only collective enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the Charter of our Organization stand any chance of leading to a positive result.\n92.\tAs in the past, my country will continue to demonstrate its unswerving solidarity with the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], the sole legitimate and authentic representative of the Palestinian people, in its heroic struggle against the aggressor and invader.\n93.\tWith regard to East Timor, both the General Assembly and the Security Council have already spoken out on the subject of the military intervention by Indonesian armed forces and have called so far, unfortunately, in vain for the prompt withdrawal, of those forces in order to enable the people of that territory freely to exercise their right to self-determination and independence in keeping with General Assembly resolution 3485 (XXX) and Security Council resolutions 384 (1975) and 389 (1976).\n94.\tIt should be emphasized that the Assembly is determined to pursue its efforts to promote the independence of East Timor by keeping the question on its agenda until the people of Timor, under the leadership of FRETILIN, have Succeeded in achieving their independence and building their own future in peace and security.\n95.\tBelize is on the threshold of national sovereignty a fact which we welcome. We understand that the question of Puerto Rico is to be discussed in the Assembly. Thus the Organization is gradually dealing with all these little islands of colonialism which are scattered about the world.\n96.\tHowever, as they steadily lose their colonial dominion in the world, certain great Powers are now acting not only against the independence of individual countries and setting up neo-colonial structures in them, but are taking action against whole regions by introducing military installations there in order to impose their political will and economic domination on the countries of those regions. They have been doing so in the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, the Caribbean, the South Atlantic and SouthEast Asia.\n97.\tFirst, a word about the situation in the Indian Ocean. As long ago as 1964, the people of the Seychelles, through Mr. France Albert Rene, then President of the Party struggling for the independence of the Seychelles, called upon the great Powers not to extend their rivalries to our waters. And in 1971 the General Assembly proclaimed the Indian Ocean a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)].\n98.\tToday, however, 85 foreign warships and nuclear submarines are patrolling the waters of that ocean. Their military presence has virtually doubled compared with the preceding year. Diego Garcia will soon be receiving 852 bombers. That island, as you know, having been emptied of its population most of whom are still living in hovels, without employment by the colonial Government of the day, has now become the major strategic nuclear air and naval base and a crucial means of intervention in the region. The Simonstown base in South Africa is being modernized with the technical assistance of Western Powers. The great Powers have also acquired the right to use air and naval facilities in certain coastal countries of the region. All this is a threat to the peace and security of the coastal States, especially as the Government of one superPower has been adopting an increasingly provocative attitude in its relations with other States.\n99.\tThe General Assembly, at its thirty-fourth session [resolution 34180 B], had decided to convene a conference on the Indian Ocean in Colombo in 1981 with a view to implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a. Zone of Peace. The Special Committee on the Indian Ocean was asked to carry out preparatory work for the convening of the conference. But while we have been able to convene other international conferences, the one on the Indian Ocean has not yet been held, and it is rather unlikely that it will be held this year. We are disappointed to note that the report of the SecretaryGeneral says nothing about the question of the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.\n100.\tThere has been no lack of man oeuvres to sabotage the conference. It has been argued that there was a need to wait until there was a \\\"harmonization of positions\\\" before convening it, but that is merely a ploy. As I have already said, the interests to be defended in the region cannot be the same for the coastal States as for the great Powers, which, in the final analysis, are interested only in the exploitation of our wealth our raw materials, our commercial potential and energy resources and in the export of their policy of confrontation between military blocs. So what \\\"harmonization of positions\\\" can there be?\n101.\tMy delegation reiterates that there is an urgent need to convene that conference in order to attain the objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, by demanding the dismantling of military installations and the withdrawal of foreign forces. As for the \\\"harmonization of positions\\\", it can only be the result o? a long process following the conference, rather than preceding it. My delegation would also like to reiterate the appeal addressed by the President of the Republic of Seychelles to the Governments of the coastal States: \\\"It is imperative that we speak out forcefully and raise our voices against this escalation which is becoming increasingly deplorable and dangerous.\\\"\n102.\tIt goes without saying that once again we demand the return of the island of Diego Garcia to Mauritian sovereignty and the removal of foreign troops.\n103.\tAs for the legal status of Mayotte and the Malagasy Islands of Gloriousness, Juan de Nova, Europa and Bassas da India, we understand that the new French Government is prepared to cooperate fully with a view to incorporating those islands, respectively, into the Comoros and the Malagasy Republic.\n104.\tRespect by the great Powers for the territorial integrity of the countries of the Indian Ocean and for the rights of all peoples to their independent policies, and the cessation of the trading off of technical and financial assistance against the right to use military facilities in the coastal countries, are major requirements for the process of demilitarizing the Indian Ocean.\n105.\tIn the Middle East as in the Mediterranean, imperialism and its agent, Zionism, are pursuing this same policy of military supremacy by creating there a situation of continuing aggression with a view to achieving economic and political control over the region. Examples are the recent provocative military maneuvers of the United States naval forces off the Libyan coast; the assassination plans; Israel's continual acts of aggression against Lebanese and other Arab territory, as well as its establishment of settlements, its attacks against UNIFIL, and, more recently still, last June its attack on and long-premeditated destruction of the Tamuz nuclear facility in Iraq.\n106.\tThe United Nations has repeatedly condemned these various acts of aggression, which form part of one and the same plan for the destabilization of the progressive forces of the region. The Security Council has condemned these acts clearly; after taking note of the pertinent resolution of the IAEA, the Council made it clear in resolution 487 (1981) that the attack on the Tamuz facility was a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international conduct. It recognized that Iraq was entitled to compensation from Israel. Already at its thirty-fourth session the General Assembly requested all Member States to take all necessary measures to prevent the transfer to Israel of fissionable material and nuclear technology which could be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The Assembly also called upon Israel to submit all its nuclear facilities to inspection by IAEA [resolution 34/89].\n107.\tIn the opinion of my delegation, the implementation of that resolution is crucial and we hope that during the thirty-sixth session the General Assembly will take other measures which it deems appropriate in order to put an end to this bellicose policy on the part of Israel.\n108.\tIt goes without saying that, having taken note of the letters of Mr. Abdulati AlObeidi, Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the General People's Committee of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, addressed to the Security Council on the subject of the provocative military maneuvers and threats against the Libyan people, its leaders and its territory, my delegation calls upon our Organization to adopt a clear position after studying the relevant facts.\n109.\tIt is becoming the practice to call the Libyan regime a terrorist one; whereas, in fact Libya is one of the few countries which has given unqualified assistance to the liberation movements of the African continent and most recently has contributed to the restoration of peace in a brother African country at the request of the legitimate Government of that country. That is why we reaffirm that any global condemnation of Libya and all threats against it are unjustifiable and unjustified, and we cannot but reject them.\n110.\tIn parallel with the intensification of the military presence of the foreign Powers in the Middle East and the Indian Ocean, in the South Atlantic, the Port of Walvis Bay, allegedly annexed by Pretoria, has been transformed into a common base for the Pretoria regime and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]>This is hardly likely to bring about an atmosphere of detente and is one more link in the strategy of destabilization and threats on the part of the great Powers regarding countries whose policies are deemed sometimes to be too independent. Some countries, both African and South American, then find themselves threatened.\n111.\tThe sphere of destabilization extends also to the Caribbean, where the Government of Grenada and that of Cuba find themselves permanently threatened by outside sources. In this respect, a letter from the Prime Minister of Grenada, Mr. Maurice Bishop, addressed to the SecretaryGeneral has been brought to our attention. We firmly denounce these external maneuvers aimed at overthrowing a Government which is deemed \\\"unfavorable\\\" and we hope that action will be taken on Mr. Bishop's letter.\n112.\tThe question of peace, stability and cooperation in SouthEast Asia has been included in the agenda of this session. We note, however, that while positive action has been taken by the countries of IndoChina in order to establish peace in the region based on mutual recognition, equality among States and respect for their sovereignty, and while in the People's Republic of Kampuchea the people, having regained their security, are reconstructing their country, which was devastated by the former regime of Pol Pot, maneuvers are continuing in the face of all this to maintain a state of insecurity in the region at the expense of peoples which have already suffered too much.\n113.\tThis year there was an international conference on the subject of Kampuchea at which a decision was taken to set up an ad hoc committee to deal with the situation in the country. But by what right was that done, and for what purpose?\n114.\tElections have taken place in that country and a legitimate Government has been elected to deal with both internal affairs and foreign relations. The relations of the People's Republic of Kampuchea with the State of Viet Nam are a matter of concern only to the peoples and Governments of those two countries.\n115.\tMy country, the Republic of Seychelles, cannot accept that this Organization should be used for purposes contrary to the spirit of its Charter. The Vietnamese Government has extended a guarantee that it will withdraw its forces from Kampuchea as soon as Kampuchea asks it to do so. The exercise of sovereignty on the part of those two countries should therefore be respected. My delegation sees no valid reason why this Assembly should again take up this question of the so-called situation in Kampuchea. On the other hand, we regret that the legitimate representatives of the people of Kampuchea continue to be excluded from this Assembly, whereas an ousted and, in its day, murderous regime, condemned by international public opinion, is still sitting here. We demand that justice be done to the people of Kampuchea and to the Government of President Heng Samrin, which has been legitimately elected.\n116.\tIn that same region, we wish to welcome the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea, which only recently were accorded international support at the Algiers meeting on that subject in March. Here again, it is high time to put an end to maneuvers and foreign interference so that this people will be able to build its own future in peace and security.\n117.\tLastly, and still within the context of the struggle of peoples to protect their independence and build their own future, my delegation wishes to extend to the Salvadorian people and its political organization, the alliance between the Frente de Liberacion Nacional Earabundo Marti and the Frente Democratico Revolucionario, its complete solidarity. In this connection we welcome the FrancoMexican statement,8 which points out that it is for the Salvadorian people alone, under the guidance of its political organization, to find a just and lasting settlement of the critical situation existing in the country, and to do so without foreign interference.\n118.\tMy delegation endorses this declaration and very much hopes that it will serve as a guide in the relations of our Organization and our States with that country.\n119.\tWe wish to conclude this second part of our statement by referring to item 39 of the agenda, which provides for a second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in 1982, following a decision taken at the thirty-third session of the General Assembly [resolution 33/71H].\n120.\tClearly, the struggle against military escalation in certain regions is closely linked with the policy of disarmament at the international level in its most salient aspects: for example, the cost of armaments, which has now risen to more than $500 billion annually, and a possible re-channeling of those financial and technical resources to the cause of peace and development; the state of insecurity which fosters the arms race; the impact of the arms trade on the economies of the third world countries; the economic importance of the military-industrial complex for the developed countries; and, lastly, the nature of the weapons themselves.\n121.\tTherefore, we can but give our fullest support to the holding of the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament.\n122.\tI have dwelt at length on the need to protect political independence and to develop new international relations in order to emphasize that both can be achieved only within the framework of economic independence and a new form of relations in this sphere.\n123.\tThe economy has always been our primary battleground. When in the course of history people began to revolt they did so primarily against poverty, insecurity and injustice, but they quickly realized that it was impossible to fight those scourges without the power to take political decisions. They fought for that power, and once independence had been partially achieved, the economic battle resumed its full intensity. But for us, the countries of the third world, it is a difficult battle to win, for the simple reason that the former colonizing countries, which are now developed, industrialized countries, have done nothing so far but to perpetuate between the economies of the north and of the south relations based on exploitation and subjugation.\n124.\tFor years we have tried to bring about a dialog with the north in order to change this situation in the interests of all. We have called for control over our raw materials and for a transfer of technology which would allow us to process them ourselves. We have demanded more justice is trade, a profound reshaping of the international monetary system and better terms for financial aid for development but to no avail. For the time being our appeal remains unheeded.\n125.\tIndeed, on the contrary, some northern countries, now headed by the United States, are getting together to continue to extract the maximum advantage from the current economic and monetary disorder. We noted this again during the most recent session of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and in connection with the opening of global negotiations on a new international economic order.\n126.\tHowever, those negotiations are still necessary. The conditions that led the United Nations to take the matter up in 1974 have not improved. We therefore call upon the Organization to pursue its efforts so that negotiations can begin as soon as possible and lead to concrete results.\n127.\tIn this respect we shall follow attentively the development of the position of the European Economic Community on this matter, just as we shall follow with interest the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development which will be held at Cancun in October. It is none the less true that the NorthSouth dialog will make progress only under the pressure of SouthSouth cooperation. We welcome the positions adopted by the non aligned movement and the OAU in this respect. Such cooperation between developing countries will enable us to devise our own models for development and will make us, as a group, more autonomous in our dealings with the North, thereby increasing our negotiating power in the North-South dialogue, a dialog that we should like to see become more authentic.\n128.\tI must admit, however, that, without wishing to sink into pessimism, my delegation is anxious about the prospects for the future. The richest and most powerful among us stubbornly refuse to consider revising the foundations of a system that has made it possible for them to become rich at the expense of the poorest and weakest.\n129.\tIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate the unequivocal dedication of the Republic of the Seychelles to the ideals of our Organization and its full willingness to contribute to the attainment of the Organization's prime objective the promotion of peace and the development of peoples for the greater good of mankind\n"

        "file_text": " I am pleased to express the cordial congratulations of the delegation of Peru to our President on his election to the presidency of the thirty--sixth session of the General Assembly. His election is a well-deserved tribute to him and to his standing as an experienced diplomat and internationalist.\n131.\tI also wish to express my delegation's appreciation to his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar, of the Federal Republic of Germany, who carried out the delicate functions of President with undeniable brilliance both within and outside this hall.\n132.\tPeru wishes to extend a welcome to the Republic of Vanuatu. Because of its location in the Pacific Ocean, it is very close to our interests, and we welcome it to the United Nations in the conviction that it will contribute effectively to the work of the Organization.\n133>. It is a special satisfaction for me to speak to this Assembly as Belize attains independence. I extend my warmest congratulations to that new State in Latin America.\n134.\tI wish also to express the admiration and appreciation of the Government of Peru to Mr. Kurt Waidheim, Secretary General of the United Nations, who for 10 years has rendered distinguished service to the cause of peace by his personal efforts, with diplomatic skill that deserves a tribute from our Organization.\n135.\tThe gathering here each year of representatives from all the States Members of the Organization gives us an opportunity to take stock of the international situation and, which is even more important, to realize our responsibilities with regard to the preservation of peace and the attainment of prosperity for all our peoples.\n136.\tOver the past year two realities have, emerged with increased clarity on the international scene. On the one hand, the gradual expansion of universal ideo-political tendencies has given rise to a lively reaction and produced a new clash between different concepts of the way to achieve the wellbeing of the community. Thus international tension has increased and the competition for military supremacy has aggravated and deepened our fears and concerns.\n137.\tOn the other hand, the manner in which the countries of the third world have asserted their positions at the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has in many instances convinced others of the justice of their views, which were at first unacceptable to the industrialized nations. This is clear demonstration of the enormous potential of the developing countries if they can stand together and apply their goodwill to coordination and action.\n138.\tThis example gives a glimmer of hope in the still slow progress towards the attainment of a new international order. However, we believe that that is not the only historical task falling on the developing countries. There is now a growing realization that our demands to the developed countries do not reflect, enmity or mean confrontation; it is also true that, in the struggle for world hegemony, to which we have alluded, there is no reason why the developing countries need take sides in this struggle, which we had thought two decades ago was a thing of the past.\n139.\tThis force which we are beginning to appreciate and which has been brought about by the convergence of the developing countries could well have a historic destiny here at the United Nations, that of preventing a suicidal conflagration and becoming the prime guarantor of peace.\n140.\tThe active promotion of peaceful coexistence is the great undertaking of the third world at the present time.\n141.\tWe reported in the previous session of the Assembly [5th meeting] on the meaning and importance of the assumption of the constitutional presidency by Mr. Fernando Belaunde Terry. We said that we had undertaken a solemn commitment to preserve freedom, respect human rights and work relentlessly for the building of a truly just society.\n142.\tNow that the first year of that Government has passed we can quote with legitimate satisfaction what the President of Peru has said: \\\"Today in Peru the Constitution prevails, the law rules and freedom reigns in the entire Republic.\\\"\t''\n143.\tNew laws covering the agriculture, livestock, petroleum and mines are giving renewed vigor to the exploitation of the natural resources of Peru. The creation of the bank for the procurement of building and housing materials and the institution of social mortgages, with subsidized interest rates, have given creative momentum to a vast housing plan which at the present time, counting units under construction and those already completed, covers more than 10,000 housing units at moderate rents.\n144.\tAn energetic beginning has been made on lengthening roads, repairing stretches of highway and building new roads along the PanAmerican highway on the coast and along the mountains and adjacent forest areas all of which has made it possible for the growing Peruvian population to establish new settlements with a view to the proper utilization of the national territory.\n145.\tThe cumulative effect of the people's cooperation and voluntary work by the communities, with the technical advice of the State, which is internationally considered to be the most efficient way of using intermediate technology, is already bearing fruit among the most remote and the poorest peoples, thanks to the 150 provincial centers.\n146.\tWe are carrying out this immense task while making every effort to improve the economy, which is still affected by the crisis we are facing and by the current world recession and inflation.\n147.\tWe promised freedom of expression and we have altered the situation which we found and kept our word. Today in Peru national newspapers, television channels and radio stations have all been put in the hands of their rightful owners, thus giving the Peruvian people the right to the free interplay of opinions and ideas.\n148.\tWe promised genuine municipal elections, and on 23 November 1980 such elections were held throughout the country.\n149.\tWe know full well that to live in freedom and complete democracy is no easy undertaking. But what can enhance the prestige of a Government and the majority political party sustaining it more than respect for the representation and the criticism of all the political sectors of the country without exception? That is what is happening today in our country.\n150.\tFull respect for human rights and a sincere attempt to achieve social justice and progress are the best safeguards against any attempt to promote violence and social chaos. They are also the best guarantees of the stability of the democratic! system which today, fortunately, has been established thanks to the express will of the Peruvian people.\n151.\tPeru's foreign policy is founded on consistent adherence to and respect for the principles on which international legal order rests. Our policy is pursued in harmony with our position in the South American continent and our desire to promote cooperation and integration in the Andean, Amazonian and Pacific subregions, with our wish to establish links with all countries at the regional, hemispheric and intercontinental levels; it is in keeping with our status as developing countries bound together with all the countries of the third world, and in line with our status as an authentically independent nonaligned country.\n152.\tWe are pleased that we have achieved the best possible relations with all neighboring countries, which guarantees not only fraternal links but also the effective attainment of our common objectives, namely, cooperation for development with respect for our national sovereignties.\n153.\tThe task of promoting integration, which has been set forth in the Constitution of the State, has been vigorously assumed by the Government of Peru. We have contributed to a thorough analysis of the Cartegena Agreement and to making the various positions more realistic, thus paving the way for the revival of the most ambitious joint effort thus far to realize Bolivar's desire for integration.\n154.\tWe are pleased that, in accordance with the strict timetable for the carrying out of those tasks, early in September a meeting of the Commission of the Cartagena Agreement was held in Bogota at which the Ministers of Industry and Integration took fruitful decisions.\n155.\tDuring this meeting effective steps were taken to carry out the Treaty for Amazonian Cooperation, and early this month in' Lima the first technical meeting took place with the participation of all member States. That was a preliminary step before the forthcoming meeting of the Council on the Amazon.\n156.\tAware that without physical links any efforts at economic integration are purely Utopian, in the Organization of American States we emphasized the need to begin serious work to link the water basins of the Orinoco, the Amazon and the Plata. It is indeed heartening to note, that, now our proposal having been favorably received,' the first technical meeting for analysis and study of this most important continental project will be held in October 1981 in Lima, under the auspices of our regional organization.\n157.\tIn his report on the work of the United Nations, the SecretaryGeneral has mentioned the happy outcome of a border incident between Peru and Ecuador [A/36/1, sect. IV]. In the early months of this year, Peru was forced, in defense of its sovereignty and integrity, to repel foreign military forces that had penetrated its territory.\n158.\tThat situation was, however, resolved through the valuable intervention of the countries guaranteeing the PeruvianEcuadorian Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Frontiers of Rio de Janeiro and its complementary documents, still in force, which Peru and Ecuador solemnly signed in 1942.\n159.\tWe should like to reiterate our appreciation to the Governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States of America which, in their letter of 23 February 1981,9 informed the President of the Security Council of the Declaration that had been produced at the Nineteenth Meeting of Consultation of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States, stating that they had assumed and would continue to assume their responsibilities as countries guaranteeing the Rio de Janeiro Protocol of 1942.\n160.\tWithin the framework of this legal instrument, Peru remains willing to cease placing of landmarks over the remaining 78 kilometer length of the common frontier of the Cordillera del Condor.\n161.\tOver the past few years we have been concerned about the growing social unrest in Central America and the Caribbean, which is an expression of the problems and difficulties in achieving sustained development. The magnitude of those unfortunate confrontations has served to draw the attention of the international community to the region.\n162.\tAlthough there is an awareness of the need and the desire to cooperate in efforts to promote socioeconomic development in the area, there has been a lack of specific machinery and a lack of coordination in efforts to achieve those objectives.\n163.\tWe have noted that in spite of their willingness many Latin American countries that are technologically advanced and have the necessary human resources have not been able to transfer their experience and potentials to Central America and the Caribbean, because of the weakness of the economies of the donor and recipient countries, which stands in the way of the speedy and easy utilization of those resources. Consequently, now that many countries are anxious to establish what has been called a \\\"miniMarshall Plan\\\" for the area, Peru proposes a plan to support horizontal cooperation and establishment of a trust fund for that purpose.\n164.\tMy Government would like to express its fraternal concern over the situation existing in the Republic of El Salvador. At the same time we express our hope that there will be a speedy settlement, and appeal for strict observance of the principle of nonintervention in a problem whose political and democratic settlement is strictly a matter for the people of El Salvador without any foreign interference, direct or indirect.\n165.\tPeru shares with other peoples of America, Africa, Asia and Oceania a common concern: development. The third world is an unavoidable reality in the great international discussions of our time. We have not yet found the path to a speedy and just development. But our countries continue to absorb, without a reciprocal balance, one third or more of the exports of the industrialized countries and we, contribute 40 per cent or more to the profits that those countries obtain from their investments. It is difficult for us to obtain fair terms of trade, but the statistics show that for the 19801990 decade we shall contribute nearly 30 per cent of the increase in world production. It should come as no surprise, then, that the countries of the third world are making a major effort to identify their common problems. Nor is it surprising that there has been a desire to reformulate international relations in such a way as to encompass all the nations of the world.\n166.\tNevertheless, the continuation of protectionist policies in many industrialized countries, the problem of the decline in the prices of raw materials caused by forces quite beyond the control of the producing countries, the resistance to the transfer of financial resources to the developing countries, the postponement of demands for a new international economic order, the deterioration in the terms of trade, the defense of sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction are problems common to the entire developing world and must be the basis of a joint effort to overcome these problems. We need more than just a statement of the problems: we need determination to do away with whatever divides us and to affirm our areas of agreement.\n167.\tIt is encouraging that the report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues recognizes facts and underscores the prospects of the world today and tomorrow, and that it puts forward a body of solutions which, if strictly carried out, will make the NorthSouth dialog fruitful and might very well point the way towards the just world that we all aspire to. Peru is confident that a spirit of solidarity and a sense of balance will prevail at the meeting to be held shortly in Cancun, Mexico, with the participation of a limited number of Heads of State or Government of North and South. As the future of the international older is at issue, other summit meetings must be envisaged where those who are not participating on this occasion will be able to state their views.\n168.\tWe view with interest the meeting that the Latin American Economic System [SELA] has scheduled for this year, to coordinate Latin American positions and to make effective our dialog with the United States, in an effort to bring about better understanding in our hemisphere.\n169.\tWe consider that development should be the common heritage of mankind, the inalienable right of our peoples, and we believe also that peace and security should not be the privilege of any group of nations. In order to ensure this right to peace and international security, to ensure that it is enjoyed by one and all, the nonaligned movement arose, and inspired by the conviction that it is through the. association of all these countries, respecting the national sovereignty of all countries and rejecting any form of discrimination, that peace can be preserved without the need for nations to form blocs with one or another of the great world Powers.\n170.\tThis year we are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the nonaligned movement, and I am pleased to stress our contribution to the coordination of efforts of the developing countries which have strengthened our position in the struggle to establish a new world order. It is important to preserve the very essence of nonalignment, based on no commitment to either of the great world Powers.\n171.\tThe present Government, of Peru, which, from the Peruvian past, has inherited traditions of justice and work and has made them the nucleus of a new ideology, is particularly well endowed to pursue an independent, sovereign foreign policy while at the same, time making full use of anything positive that is applicable to our national realities which can be found in the various policies pursued in today's world.\n172.\tIn the search for a new order, the developing countries have been aware that they cannot achieve immediate results in their dialog with the industrialized countries, and they have realized that full use must be made of 'their own present and potential economies. For that reason,' the Group of 77, which encompasses at the present time more than 127 developing countries, put forward the idea of what it calls \\\"SouthSouth cooperation\\\", and this year the program for economic cooperation among developing countries [see A/36/333] was approved at its most recent meeting at Caraballeda, Venezuela. In a concrete and consistent way it contains distinct sectorial objectives in the financial, monetary, commercial, food, raw material, energy and technological areas now at various levels of development.\n173.\tIt should be mentioned here that horizontal cooperation should not be seen as a substitute for global economic cooperation between the developing countries and the industrialized countries.\n174.\tThe Government of Peru appreciates the true dimension of the efforts that are needed, and it wishes to participate in the solution of international problems. We have promoted global negotiations within the United Nations as the best way to achieve, by negotiation and not through confrontation, a restructuring of the present unjust international economic order, lowering the rising level of world tension and forging a truly safe world for everyone.\n175.\tPeru has been active in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has been meeting since the end of 1973 and which in August completed its tenth session, at Geneva. In so doing, we have done nothing more than protect the higher national interests of our country, a mining country of the first order, which, in the future, with many other countries, could see the prices of its raw materials and minerals affected if in the future the free unilateral exploitation of the seabed by the highly industrialized countries and their transnational enterprises is permitted. That would violate the principle that the seabed and its resources are the common heritage of mankind.\n176.\tWe are pleased by the fact that at the last meeting the unofficial text of the draft Convention became official, that the argument for 200 miles which was so tenaciously defended has finally achieved its official confirmation, the headquarters of the International Seabed Authority and of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea have been established and consensus has been reached on the difficult task of the delimitation of the economic zones and continental shelves between States with adjacent and opposing coastlines.\n177.\tAs we have already stated, these achievements demonstrate that the States of the third world are united in their determination to prevent any changes in substantive aspects of the draft Convention. This is also a desires shared by the great majority of the developed countries that participated in the Conference.\n178.\tIt is our firm hope that when the Government of the United States reviews its position on the draft convention it will reach conclusions similar to those that made it possible for its earlier negotiators to work within the Conference. This would mean an honoring of commitments negotiated by consensus among the other countries participating in the Conference. It would indeed be regrettable if the international law of the sea were to be undermined, for it is inevitable that it be established as the sole guarantee against chaos, confrontation and unlawful activities by any State.\n179.\tOne of the most important events of the foreign policy of Peru this year has been Peru's accession to the Antarctic Treaty, signed in Washington on 1 December 1959. The Government of Peru considers that, given the special geographical position of our country, we have a direct and substantial interest in the Antarctic region and consequently, on the basis of the principle of the legal equality of all the signatories, we shall strive hard in the search for a general and final statute for that area in which equal consideration will be given to the interests of all the States involved.\n180.\tMy country deems it opportune to mention the important step taken by the United Nations in promoting the Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, which has permitted the drawing up of the Nairobi Program of Action on the development and utilization of those sources of energy.\\\" In addition, we believe that in order to consolidate the progress that has been made it will be necessary to bring about a real transfer of financial and technological resources from the developed countries to the developing countries with a view to the utilization of those new sources of energy.\n181.\tThe Government of Peru views with apprehension the close relationship between the tense international situation and the deadlock in the disarmament process. The deterioration of the latter has been dangerously aggravated by an escalation in the arms race on a worldwide level which involves primarily those nations that have the largest arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons. In this connection, Peru is particularly concerned over the fact that an appreciation of the universal importance of peace tends to be diluted in theoretical and binding formulations, if not in misunderstandings which lead to failure, and that the institutionalized efforts of the United Nations run the risk of becoming bureaucratized when they are not legitimized by the political will of Governments.\n182.\tIn keeping with our traditional positions, Peru will continue to work in every way possible for general and complete disarmament.\n183.\tOur Organization, through its work on the constant and difficult task of promoting a world order in which each individual and each nation can enjoy without any encumbrance, limitations or threats the elementary rights to freedom, security, development and wellbeing, is the appropriate framework for the consideration of any matter that may have to do with the defense of human rights.\n184.\tTwo decades ago, Peru ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and we are a signatory the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol. Regionally, we have ratified the\nAmerican Convention on Human Rights, known as the \\\"Pact of San Jose, Costa Rica\\\". We have also signed other international instruments the purpose of which is to protect human rights.\n185.\tPeru, in keeping with its demonstrated humanistic calling, today reiterates its devotion to those principles and rights as well as its determination to contribute to the promotion of the essential dignity of the human person and the development and wellbeing of society in a framework of freedom, social justice and full respect for the basic rights of the individual.\n186.\tThis historic position of principle, set forth in the new Political Charter of the State of Peru, has been and will be zealously respected by the Government of President Belaunde Terry.\n187.\tWe reject as inhumane and contrary to the march of history the system of apartheid which prevails in South Africa. Peru is a country which is proud of its multiracial ancestry, and we cannot allow the establishment of discriminatory differences of any kind. This is set forth in one of the articles of the Peruvian Constitution.\n188.\tPeru once again denounces the unlawful occupation of the territory of Namibia, in flagrant violation of the express injunctions of the United Nations and of the advisory opinion of 21 June 1971 of the International Court of Justice.12 We reaffirm here the unconditional support of my Government for the self-determination of the Namibian people, their inalienable right to independence, respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity and their right to their natural resources.\n189.\tPeru reaffirms its devotion to peace and its full and total support for the principle banning the use of force in the settlement of disputes, which is the fundamental guiding principle of its foreign policy. Disputes must be settled by the peaceful means set forth in the international instruments to which the parties are bound, for respect for the obligations arising from treaties, as enshrined in the Charter, is the indisputable foundation on which contemporary international relations are built. Thus, Peru will cooperate in the adoption of any international instrument which bans once and for all the use of force in relations among States.\n190.\tIt is therefore regrettable that situations of tension persist between Iraq and Iran, in Cyprus, in Kampuchea and in Afghanistan. My delegation considers that every effort must be made in this Assembly and in the Security Council to put an end soon to those situations. At the same time, we give full backing to the SecretaryGeneral in his efforts to find negotiated political formulas which would contribute to their solution, whether by mandate of the Council or on his own initiative within the framework of his prerogatives.\n191.\tMy delegation cannot fail to indicate its rejection of the recent invasion of Angola by foreign troops, which not only is an attack on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, but which furthermore contributes to an increase in the threat to international peace and security.\n192.\tWe express our serious concern over the deterioration in the situation in the Middle East. We condemn the aggression and the use of force in recent events both in Lebanon and in Iraq; they violate the standards of peaceful coexistence and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n193.\tif is urgent that the General Assembly find valid procedures and machinery which would bring this painful conflict to a satisfactory solution, bearing in mind the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, the secure existence of all the concerned States and parties in the region and all valid efforts to achieve peace and understanding.\n194.\tPeru considers that it is the obligation of the Assembly to tackle the task of making the provisions of the Charter of the Organization more effective. To that end, we believe that the decision-making machinery of the United Nations must be revitalized to make it more effective, especially in the case of the Security Council. It is discouraging to note the abuse of the exceptional privileges of certain countries in the Organization. It is therefore our urgent and inescapable obligation to resolve this serious situation.\n195.\tIn my country, the Head of State has appealed to all political parties and all sectors of national activity to join together, without setting aside their own convictions, \\\"in their humble homes with all their unfulfilled yearnings, in the squalor of their urban and rural slums, in their decaying schools, to take the decision to overcome their afflictions\\\".\n196.\tHe called for a great united effort: for national brotherhood.\n197.\tAt this time of tension and trial for the international community, I think that it behooves us too to think deeply. There should be an appeal to the conscience of all nations to join together making use of only what is positive in progress and science to solve mankind's problems.\n198.\tFor its part, my country, at this thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, calls for world brotherhood.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish at the outset to extend to you, Sir, our sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. You are renowned for your experience and competence and for the distinguished manner in which you represent your country. Your election to this high office is a token of the great esteem in which your country, Iraq, is held and of its constructive role in international affairs. We are confident that this role will contribute to the realization of world, progress towards a brighter and more promising future.\n145.\tIn this connection I wish to extend my best wishes to the President of the previous session of the Assembly, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, and to commend him for his ability and wisdom. He conducted the proceedings of the Assembly with a competence that earned him our appreciation and gratitude.\n146.\tI also wish to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the SecretaryGeneral for the genuine efforts he is exerting in his constant endeavor to solve international problems and to maintain the principles which form the basis of the Organization.\n147.\tI also wish to join the other heads of delegation in welcoming Vanuatu and Belize as new Members of the United Nations. I am certain that they will contribute with other Member States to the realization of the noble objectives of the Organization.\n148.\tRelations among States should not be based on submission and surrender; nor should they depend on power, domination and control. They must be based on solid principles and objective values, inspired by mutual interests and built on solid foundations of equality and justice. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has laid down solid foundations for its relations with other countries which brook no compromise. These foundations are not subject to any concessions. They are based on respect for the principle of national sovereignty and absolute rejection of any attempts to compromise it. They are based on equal relations with others and rejection of attempts at interference in their internal affairs. The Kingdom, like the rest of the international community, formulates its international positions and establishes its foreign relations on the basis of its international commitments and its ties with international organizations and bodies.\n149.\tMy country was one of the original signatories of the San Francisco Charter, which gave birth to the United Nations. Ever since, my country's faith in the importance of the Organization and in the basic objectives of the Charter has not been shaken. I do not intend at this stage to discuss at length the accomplishments of the United Nations or its achievements in various fields. We all endorse these efforts and believe in their importance and necessity. Our contribution is governed by our capabilities and our means. However, it would be unrealistic to state that the Organization has fulfilled all the aspirations which the peoples of the world have placed in it.\n150.\tThe real challenge faced by the Organization lies in the fact that i* still functions in a world which does not adequately believe in it. It operates in the midst of superPower conflicts and of States which pursue policies of conquest and domination.\n151.\tOnce more the resort to force in international affairs is taking precedence in contemporary international life.\n152.\tThe gap between rich and poor countries has grown wider, and we are witnessing an increase in violations by the big Powers of the sovereignty of small States.\n153.\tThe aggressive and increasingly dangerous practices of certain States have continued.\n154.\tThe legitimate rights of peoples to self-determination have been compromised.\n155.\tThe continuation of these conditions and their negative effect on international relations calls for an intensification of efforts to put an end to such defiance and for the search for such means as would secure the needs of the international community and protect the interests of all peoples and nations. If there is to be any hope of overcoming these conditions or finding a course which would enable the peoples of the world to realize their aspirations for peace and prosperity, the United Nations must be able to protect its main objectives as manifested in the Charter.\n156.\tThe prestige of the Organization, which embodies the hopes and aspirations of nations for peace, will remain in jeopardy if it continues to be satisfied with the adoption of resolutions and recommendations on matters of which it is seized. Hie ability of the United Nations to serve as a reliable safety valve for the maintenance of international peace and security, on the one hand, and for laying the foundations for justice and cooperation among States in the political, economic and social fields, on the other, depends to a great extent on its ability to play its role not solely by adopting resolutions but also by implementing them. Implementation is the real test of the value of a resolution.\n157.\tWhile we all bear responsibility as Members of the Organization for the maintenance of world peace, justice and equality among States, the superPowers bear a special responsibility in that regard. The fact that those Powers possess lethal weapons capable of destroying the world gives them no special rights. Might does not confer rights as much as it imposes obligations and responsibilities. Those Powers have an obligation to establish the foundations for international cooperation based on equality and justice. They also have an obligation to protect the interests of the small States and to defend their independence rather than partitioning them into spheres of influence. History provides ample proof that dividing the world into spheres of influence between conflicting\nPowers leads, in the final analysis, to armed conflict between those Powers.\n158.\tThe two world wars were a clear example of that. If those wars led to the destruction of vast areas of the world, a new world war will lead to its total devastation. The real solution to that problem does not lie in the consecration of foreign influence, particularly, that of the superpowers. The solution requires the elimination of the reasoning which calls for the division of the world into areas of influence. Consequently, the protection of our independence, the elimination and rejection of foreign influence and the refusal to acquiesce in such reasoning involve the protection not only of our rights as independent and free States, but of the security of the superPowers themselves.\n159.\tWe are following with great concern and watching with considerable caution the developments in the relations between the two superPowers. International detente, that is, mutual understanding between those Powers, which was one of the most important events of our time, has now reached a dead end. It has lost an essential element on which it should have been based, namely, that detente should extend to all and be in the interests of all. It should fulfill the aspirations and legitimate rights of all peoples and not be limited to a single relaxation between the forces of the two superPowers. Nor should it consist of ait understanding by them on how to impose their will on other States or proceed, under the guise of such an understanding, to divide the world into spheres of influence and domination.\n160.\tWe are now witnessing an increase in world polarization, and iiv competition between the superPowers which involves the threat of a new cold war that would endorse invasions and expansion and would jeopardize the security of the region of the Middle East and its aspirations to peace and prosperity. Our. region, the Middle East, probably suffers most from that tense situation and from the effects of the dangerous strategic competition threatening it. Those forces have been endeavoring to establish a military presence in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. But we are anxious for the region to remain outside that conflict and that it be preserved as a zone of peace, instead of as a theater of conflict.\n161.\tOn the other hand, we are gravely concerned about the recent announcement of \\\"strategic cooperation\\\" between the United States and Israel, which is likely to thrust our region into international alliances and cast it into the cauldron of superPower conflict. That is inconsistent with the role of the United States in its efforts to find a settlement to the Middle East crisis. Such a role requires that the United States assume an impartial position.\n162.\tAt the same time, we find the efforts pursued by the Soviet Union to consolidate polarization in our region inconsistent with its role as a superpower, responsible for the maintenance of stability and the reduction of international tension.\n163.\tAll this confirms that international peace cannot be maintained and international relations cannot be stabilized\nunless the contemporary international political order is based on the principles of law, equality and justice, which together constitute a complete and indivisible framework.\n164.\tJust as we have asked that detente not be at the expense of the third world and its rights, we also force fully demand that the renewed strategic conflict not be at the expense of the third world and the aspiration of its peoples to peace and stability.\n165.\tA positive factor of which we can be proud in the political developments witnessed by our region was the establishment of the Gulf Cooperation Council. That positive development is consistent and fully in harmony with the charters and resolutions of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States. It is also consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the nonaligned movement. It in fact represents a strengthening and consecration of cooperation and interaction among the. member States of the Council. At the same time, it does not constitute an alliance against anyone. It is an expression of the free will of those countries and of cooperation among them, in full and mutual awareness of their national interests, free of any outside influence. The Council will be a positive factor for stability in the region and will play an effective role in helping to eliminate foreign interference, particularly in matters which are considered to be within the exclusive competence of the Gulf States.\n166.\tThe membership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in OPEC, its useful work in international economic bodies and its effective role in international efforts are aimed at strengthening international economic cooperation and finding solutions for all the problems encountered. That has not only led to its adoption of responsible economic policies but also to the establishment of a pragmatic and realistic perspective with respect to the international economic situation, its problems, and the solutions proposed for overcoming those problems.\n167.\tA glance at that economic situation indicates that there is a reality which requires no discussion, namely, that the world is divided into developing countries with a declining standard of living, suffering from starvation, destitution and lack of resources, and industrialized countries with a high standard of living, enjoying extreme affluence and an abundance of resources. That situation constitutes a disequilibrium recognized by everyone. The. whole world, including the industrialized countries, acknowledges that disequilibrium in the international economic situation. Yet it continues to lack the political will to change that situation. The only solution for that disequilibrium is that real wealth not be limited to specific States. It should be transferred and directed from the industrialized to the developing countries. The transfer of that wealth does not imply or aim at a reduction in the standard of living of the industrialized countries, but the extension of the scope of the economic structure, horizontally or vertically, will increase the opportunity for the developed industrialized countries of maintaining their continued economic growth in the medium and long term. We are proceeding from the perspective that, like it or not, this is one interdependent world. Our objectives can not be aimed at targets that are not interdependent.\n168.\tThe discussion by the General Assembly of economic matters and of international economic cooperation for development is of great importance because those matters have a considerable impact on international peace and security and on the reduction of international tension. While economic stagnation continues at the international level, the cost of imports by the developing countries of food products and capital and consumer goods increases, with a concurrent reduction in the demand for their basic products. Protective trade measures in the markets of the industrialized countries have been increasing, thus diminishing the exports of the developing countries to those markets. That results in a deterioration of trade conditions and an increase in trade balance deficits. Those problems are compounded by the rise in the costs of loans and loan servicing, fluctuations in the rates of exchange and a substantial decline in the official development assistance offered by the industrialized countries.\n169.\tThat gloomy picture of the conditions of a large number of developing countries requires a new effort to launch global economic negotiations aimed at the coordination of international economic performance and increased efficiency in international cooperation for development. It is regrettable that the efforts of the General Assembly to launch the global economic negotiations should be impeded because of differences over certain procedural matters. The nature of the subjects submitted for discussion does not permit delay or postponement. They must be. given the priority and care which they deserve.\n170.\tIn this regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes to commend the initiative of Mr. Jose Lopez Portillo, the President of Mexico, and Mr. Bruno Kreisky, the Chancellor of Austria, in calling for a limited summit meeting at Cancun to discuss problems of international cooperation for development. We hope that that meeting will succeed in restoring mutual confidence and strengthening common understanding between the participating developing and developed States. We also hope that it will provide favorable conditions for launching a new round of global economic negotiations and assist in the success of such negotiations rather than serve as an alternative for it. The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through its participation in the meeting, will exert every possible effort to realize those hopes.\n171.\tThe policy of racial discrimination which South Africa continues to practice is racist, detestable and inhumane and based on contempt and the oppression of man by man. There is no longer a place for such a policy in our present age. The days of imperialism and enslavement are gone forever.\n172.\tThe continuation of the policy of apartheid by the present regime in South Africa is the reason for its refusal to withdraw from Namibia and to deny its people the right to self-determination and national independence, despite the repeated resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Those resolutions state clearly and unequivocally that the occupation of Namibia by South Africa is illegal and poses a threat to international peace and security. My Government condemns the obstacles impeding the complete liberation of Namibia and supports the resolutions of the General Assembly in this regard, culminating in its resolution adopted at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly [resolution ES8/2].\n173.\tThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is proud to be a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Islam is its religion; the Holy Koran is its constitution and guiding light. Islam is a religion that calls for freedom and stands against aggression, exploitation and oppression. It opposes all forms of backwardness and encourages freedom of thought. It is capable of adapting to the accomplishments of our age. The basic nature of the Organization of the Islamic Conference meets the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the world. For those reasons, and despite the fact that its membership is limited to Islamic countries, most of its activities and policies reflect the hopes and aspirations of all nations. That is why the Organization of the Islamic Conference occupies a distinguished place in the international community and has close relations with regional and international organizations with which we share common aims and aspirations. Those are the United Nations, the League of Arab States, the OAU, the nonaligned movement and so forth.\n174.\tIn January this year, the Third Islamic Summit Conference convened in the Holy City of Mecca. That great and historic gathering was a remarkable occasion at which leaders of Islamic countries adopted resolutions and recommendations of great importance and issued the historic Mecca Declaration. The upshot of all that is that the Islamic gathering is one for good and not for evil, for strength through law and not strength for oppression; a gathering that does not strive to create areas of influence at the expense of others but to achieve independence for all countries.\n175.\tThe Islamic States do not aspire to create a bloc opposed to existing military alliances. They strive to eliminate the foundation of alliances which bring death and destruction. The Islamic countries support disarmament and oppose the arms race. They oppose the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world and favor their reduction and elimination.\n176.\tThe initiatives of the Islamic Conference and the constructive role it plays are aimed at strengthening and developing cooperation among its members for their benefit and development, and ultimately for the benefit of humanity as a whole, thus responding to the objectives of the United Nations and upholding the principles of the Charter. The Organization of the Islamic Conference has exerted a considerable effort to maintain the Arab and Islamic character of Jerusalem, which is part of its heritage and civilization, particularly when the blind arrogance of Israel has led it to proclaim Jerusalem as the \\\"eternal capital\\\" of its racist entity, thereby challenging the world conscience, Islamic consensus and international law.\n177.\tThe Organization of the Islamic Conference was able to demonstrate to the whole world the dangerous dimensions of the flagrant Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. It condemned the Soviet Union and called for a complete, unconditional withdrawal of military forces from Afghanistan, and for nonrecognition of, or cooperation with, the present regime.\n178.\tWe therefore call upon all the other nations of the world to support that organization's position on this matter by condemning and denouncing the action of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Furthermore, the Organization of the Islamic Conference called on all nations to support the people of Afghanistan in the elimination of all forms of oppression, subjugation and occupation so that that people may regain its freedom and independence and be able to exercise its sovereign right over its territory. That will not be possible without the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet military forces from Afghanistan. The support that the Soviet Union continues to give to the rights of the Arabs in Palestine, for which we are thankful, does not justify its occupation of Afghanistan, nor does it justify the denial of the rights of the people of Afghanistan. We appeal to the Soviet Union to respond to the legitimate demands of the Afghan people and its right to self-determination. We hope that the Soviet Union will respond to this call so that its role is in keeping with what is right and just everywhere.\n179.\tThe continuation of the conflict between Iran and Iraq has created deep concern in our region and a strong desire for its termination. The Islamic countries have spared no effort in this regard through the Goodwill Committee, whose membership was enlarged during the Islamic Conference held in the Holy City of Mecca, and Which has among its members nine heads of State, members of the Islamic Conference [see A!36i 1381 annex 1V\\. We strongly support those efforts, and the supplementary endeavors of the nonaligned movement and the United Nations and hope that all these efforts will bear fruit. At the same time we very strongly deplore the recent aggression against the brotherly State of Kuwait, which was aimed at certain economic installations. It represents an aggression against the sanctity and sovereignty of Kuwaiti air space, undermines the security and stability of the region and violates international law and practice. The continuation of such aggression will lead the States of the Arab League to apply the Treaty on Joint defense and Economic Cooperation between the League of Arab States.\n180.\tThe membership of Saudi Arabia in the Arab League is not merely a political or casual relationship. It is the reality of a common destiny and civilization reflecting a common history and culture, and common hopes for a world enjoying stability, prosperity and progress. The League of Arab States, in conformity with the objectives of the United Nations and its Charter, has played an important and constructive role aimed at strengthening political, economic, social and cultural cooperation among its members. In its efforts to attain those ends it was faced with a formidable obstacle that continues to prevent the establishment of peace and stability not only in the Middle East region but throughout the whole world. By that I mean Israeli aggression and the hateful racist policy pursued by Israel. When we refer to the Israeli enemy, we have in mind not only its aggression against a peaceful people in their own homeland, and the unlawful acquisition of their lands' and property, or the fact that such aggression constitutes a violation of principles and supreme human values and amounts to a brazen defiance of the resolutions adopted by international bodies; we also perceive the aggression as being directed against high moral values and lofty human principles. Ever since the forces of East and West combined to partition Palestine and to establish Israel, that State has decided to adopt expansion as its principle and aggression as its way of life.\n181.\tThe Jews who emigrated to Palestine at the turn of the century and in 1947 acquired 57 per cent of the fertile lands of Palestine have, through theft or unlawful seizure, extended their domain to include the whole area of Palestine, in addition to other neighboring Arab territories. Since 1967, Israel has been creating settlements in the occupied Arab territories. In June 1981 they had reached a total of 32 settlements on the Syrian Golan Heights, 12 in the Gaza Strip, in Palestine, and 18 in northern Sinai, also in Palestine, and on the outskirts of Rafah. Thus the total number of Israeli settlements in that area at the end of June 1981 amounted to about 30 settlements in occupied Arab territories in addition to 111 on the West Bank and in Palestine. Israel has in fact usurped 34.4 per cent of the total area of the occupied West Bank, which had already been reduced to about 20 per cent of the total area of Palestine.\n182.\tIsrael was established on a basis of aggression and continues to thrive on it. Its history has been marked by policies of expansion, torture and occupation, which form the basis of its existence. In the course of just one month Israel has committed two criminal aggressions against two Arab capitals. The Security Council adopted a resolution condemning Israel for its aggression against the nuclear reactor in Iraq [resolution 487 (1981)]. No sooner had the ink on that resolution dried than Israel committed a savage crime against areas crowded with civilians in Beirut, killing and wounding hundreds of people, including women, old people and children.\n183.\tEach time the excuses have been the same. Israel allows itself to violate the air space of a sovereign State and a Member of the United Nations, to occupy parts of its land and kill its people, and to attack installations in another Arab capital all under the pretext that such actions are dictated by the necessity of defending its security.\n184.\tIn an effort to deceive and mislead public opinion, Israel claims that its security is threatened by the existence of the Iraqi nuclear reactor. It also claims that its aggression against Lebanon is designed to protect the Christians and sometimes to protect itself against Palestinians in southern Lebanon. All these claims involve complete distortions of fact. On what basis could Israel consider the nuclear reactor to be a threat to its security, when in fact Iraq had established the reactor for peaceful purposes, had signed the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and agreed to open its reactor to IAEA inspection. Since when has Israel been concerned about the wellbeing of the Christians in Lebanon? It has itself killed and displaced the Christians of Palestine. Furthermore, the existence of the Palestinians in southern Lebanon is a direct result of the Zionist aggression against the Palestinians and their displacement from their homes and country.\n185. If we examine the various resolutions adopted by the United Nations condemning the aggressive actions of Israel, and stressing the right of the Palestinian people to their homeland and the Arab character of Jerusalem, we find nothing in them to support the Israeli expansionist logic or its illogical claims. The resolutions of condemnation adopted by the international Organization against Israel have never deterred it from pursuing such policies.\n186.. A glance at those resolutions shows clearly that Israel is a heavy burden on the international community. Never before has any Member of the United Nations so grossly violated international norms or gone so far in opposing the will of the international community. Have not the resolutions adopted by the United Nations condemning Israel piled up to no avail? They have not even been able to prevent Israel from pursuing its policy of aggression and expansion. Has no leniency towards Israel encouraged South Africa to follow suit to the extent that both now share a common policy of racism and expansionism?\n187.\tI have no need to recite here the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council in\\\" this regard. Their number alone is sufficiently significant. The most disturbing factor in this respect, however, is the continued defiance by Israel of those resolutions, which obliges the United Nations to reiterate its previous resolutions every time the Palestinian question is considered.\n188.\tWe feel strongly that the need at present is not to adopt new resolutions, but rather to combine all those resolutions into a single resolution to be adopted by the Security Council and considered as a framework for a comprehensive and just solution to this problem.\n189.\tHis Royal Highness Prince Fahd ibn Abdul Aziz, Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister; put forward certain principles which can be used as guidelines in the formulation of such a resolution. Those principles, previously embodied in resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly, are as follows: first, the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, including Arab Jerusalem; two, the removal of settlements established by Israel in Arab lands after 1967; three, a guarantee of freedom of worship and religious rites for all religions in the Holy Places; four, confirmation of the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and compensation for those who do not opt to do so; five, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip should be placed under the supervision of the United Nations for a transitional period not exceeding a few months; six, the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital; seven, confirmation of the right of the countries of the region to live in peace; eight, the United Nations or some of its Members shall guarantee the implementation of these principles.\n190.\tHis Royal Highness has stressed that the implementation of these principles depends on three conditions which must be fulfilled. Those conditions are: first, cessation of the unlimited American support for Israel; secondly, an end to Israeli arrogance, a condition which would be automatically fulfilled if the first condition were guaranteed; and, thirdly, recognition that the Palestinian question is the main factor in the Middle East equation.\n191.\tThe United Nations has done enough urging and condemning, yet an equitable and just solution is nowhere in sight. We ask ourselves whether there is any way to reach such a settlement, other than to proceed from the consensus of condemnation to tangible implementation. This is the question that must now be answered by the General Assembly and the Security Council. The specific procedure is embodied in the resolution we have proposed, which should constitute the framework for a settlement.\n192.\tAll the Arab countries desire peace and strive for its attainment. While they may disagree on positions concerning international efforts and initiatives, they do not differ on the need for a just and comprehensive peace.\n193.\tOur faith in the principles and objectives of the United Nations, wherein all nations of the world meet, is solid and becomes even stronger with the passage of time, despite the problems and crises that face the world. Because of our faith in the Organization, we do not hesitate to come to it each year to discuss the various problems and crises in the world and to cooperate with others in seeking solutions for the establishment of a world community characterized by stability, progress, peace and security. May God guide us.\n"

        "file_text": "25.\tMr. President, on behalf of the Government of Finland, I wish to extend to you our congratulations on your election\nas President of this thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. You bring to your high office unique knowledge and experience based on service in various capacities spanning more than two decades. Those qualities will stand us, in good stead during a session which may have more than its normal share of difficulties.\n26.\tMay I also extend a warm welcome to Vanuatu, the one hundred and fifty-fifth Member of the United Nations. \\\"The accession of that country to sovereignty and membership of the United Nations is yet another proof of the success of the Organization in the peaceful dismantlement of erstwhile colonial empires.\n27.\tTwenty years have passed since the death of the second SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjold, and those who died with him. Both in life and in death, Hammarskjold was the incarnation of the immutable ideals of the United Nations. Today the memory of Dag Hammarskjold should stand as a constant reminder and an inspiration to us all in a quest for a more rational and peaceful world order as prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations.\n28.\tThe present world situation causes profound anxiety, which runs deeper than it has in years. Its cause is not a sudden change in the realm of realities. The threat of a major war has not become imminent. Regional conflicts, while acute, have remained regional. The sharp increase in tensions therefore has other causes less tangible, yet of equal impact. What I have in mind is a change in political perceptions and attitudes. The policies resulting from that change could bear the name of confrontation. As a consequence, the EastWest dialog and cc operation have reached their lowest level for well over a decade.\n29.\tConfrontation pits against each other two major Powers with a preponderance of military might. Less than 10 years ago, the same two Powers solemnly declared that in the nuclear age there was no alternative to peaceful coexistence. At the same time they committed themselves to refraining from seeking i\\\" 'lateral advantage at the expense of each other, to cooperation in preventing conflicts that could increase international tension and to limitation of armaments bilaterally and multilaterally. Today confrontation seems to have overtaken these pledges.\n30.\tBut confrontation does not exist in a void. It is a complex phenomenon, with elements of historical legacy, ideological convictions, political and economic interests. The consequences of confrontation are global. No one is totally immune from its impact. Confrontation fuels the arms race, while the arms race feeds on confrontation. The disarmament process has come to a halt and even retrogressed. Policies of confrontation aggravate regional conflicts and further complicate their peaceful resolution. Tensions become endemic. International economic exchanges suffer. Problems of the developing world are either ignored or seen in the distorting light of EastWest confrontation.\n31.\tPolicies of confrontation generate a sense of uncertainty and insecurity. The risks involved are compounded by unpredictability. Confrontation is thus inconsistent with the quest for a stable international order. The time has come for a reassessment in the search for a new international consensus. The basis for such a consensus exists. It is the Charter of the United Nations and a strict respect for its provisions by nations large and small, respect not only in word but in deed. The broad objectives of this action should remain detente, disarmament and development. The instruments for this purpose are readily available. They consist of dialog and negotiation. The very essence of an orderly conduct of international affairs is a continuous and unhindered communication between States. The responsibility lies, in the first instance, with those Governments that, because of their overpowering military might, hold the balance of peace in their hands.\n32.\tIn spite of these troubled times, Finland has managed to enjoy both external and internal stability. Pursuing a policy of neutrality, Finland continues to stay outside the conflicts of interest between the great Powers and maintains good relations with all countries. Finland has made use of its international position for the benefit of the entire international community in actively promoting international peace and cooperation, particularly in the United Nations and at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Finland will continue to pursue this policy.\n33.\tFinland is part of the Nordic region, which during the whole postwar era has remained largely untouched by international tensions. This has been the result of the endeavors of the Nordic Governments and the willingness of the great Powers to preserve the stability of the Nordic region. At their meeting at Copenhagen on 1 and 2 September this year, the Foreign Ministers of the Nordic countries confirmed again the importance of the stable and balanced security situation of the Nordic region. They underlined its contribution to the maintenance of peace and security also in a wider international context. The continued absence of nuclear weapons in these countries is a vital element in this regard. In order to strengthen further the existing security policy situation, the Nordic countries have also agreed to continue their contacts concerning the idea of a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Nordic area.\n34.\tPolicies of confrontation and lack of trust have brought disarmament negotiations to a virtual halt. Arms negotiations are fewer and results almost nonexistent. Conversely, military imbalance, real or perceived, leads to new rounds  of the arms race. Pursuit of military superiority, in whatever form or for whatever purpose, is as futile it is dangerous. Security is in disarmament, not in arms.\n35.\tThe gap between achievement and aspiration in disarmament is wider than ever. Weapons of increased sophistication are developed, produced, deployed. Military doctrines are adjusted in response to new technologies. Ultimately, advances in military technology may prove upsetting to global strategic stability, an outcome that would have incalculable consequences.\n36. Whatever the commitment to curbing the arms race, the perilously advancing military technology will make all efforts in future more complex than hitherto. It will be ever more difficult to agree what weapons should be limited, and how. Verification may prove increasingly complex. Entirely new mechanisms may be necessary.\n37. The continuing arms race threatens the security of Europe. Nuclear weapons in Europe have become a subject of acute controversy. Whatever the merits of the claims and counterclaims concerning military balance in this field, the end result is the same: less security for all. There is only one way out: negotiations in good faith, and the sooner, the better. As for the Finnish Government, we have consistently opposed the development and deployment of all new nuclear weapons, their spread to new owners and their deployment on new territories.\n38.\tDirect negotiations between the two major Powers on these questions are urgently called for. Every effort should be made to reach a decision on comprehensive talks on confidence and security-building measures and disarmament in Europe, as envisaged in the ongoing talks at the Madrid follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n39.\tA successful outcome of the Madrid follow-up meeting as a whole is of the utmost importance in the light of the present international situation. The persistent efforts of this meeting, which has already continued for over a year, and the results achieved so far reflect, in our opinion, a widely and seriously felt need to preserve the process itself in order to revive and enhance its contribution to detente in Europe. Positive results from Madrid would not merely have an effect on relations among European States but would make an impact on the international situation as a whole.\n40.\tIn a world of scarce human and natural resources, the arms race is a crippling economic strain, both globally and within national economies. The arms race is a choice against development and, ultimately, a choice against the needs of people everywhere, particularly in the developing world. We should also bear in mind that the production of arms is a senseless waste of resources and is destructive to the environment. In view of the vulnerability of the environment and the scarcity of resources, the potential for industrial growth should be used for the purposes of development.\n41.\tDespite the unpromising outlook, the search for security through disarmament must continue. Efforts to limit nuclear arms must be revitalized. Strengthening the nonproliferation regime is more imperative than ever. The United Nations disarmament machinery must proceed with its work. Its priority items should remain a comprehensive test-ban treaty, a chemical weapons treaty and security guarantees to nonnuclear-weapon States. Progress on these items is essential if next year's special session on disarmament is to provide a new momentum for international disarmament efforts.\n42.\tThe questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea remain on the agenda of the General Assembly. A peaceful settlement of those conflicts has not been reached. They therefore constitute a severe strain on relations between major Powers and thereby on the international situation as a whole. At the same time, some new elements have been injected into these questions in the form of proposals from various quarters. Efforts in the direction of a peaceful settlement should be pursued in the interest of strengthening international peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\n43.\tThe situation in the Middle East is increasingly critical. Many developments in the area have no direct link with the ArabIsraeli conflict. Yet this problem, as long as it remains unsolved, is the key to the situation and a constant threat to peace and security not only in the region, but in the world as a whole. Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and actions to change the status of Jerusalem are in conflict with the efforts to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The recent raids on Beirut and Baghdad have further aggravated the situation. The cycle of violence must be brought to a halt.\n44.\tThe Finnish Government continues to consider that a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel has to withdraw from Arab territories occupied since 1967. Acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible. The right of Israel and all other States in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries must be guaranteed. Furthermore, the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], as the most significant representative of the national aspirations of the Palestinians, has the right to participate in negotiations on a comprehensive settlement. The implementation of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including their right to national self-determination, is an essential part of the settlement.\n45.\tAs long as a comprehensive negotiated solution has not been reached in the Middle East, the United Nations must continue its vital task of peacekeeping in the region. The necessary conditions for this activity have to be secured, in particular in Lebanon, where they are in jeopardy. Finland, for its part, continues to contribute to\nthe peacekeeping operations in the Middle East.\n46.\tSouthern Africa is another region of protracted conflict. South Africa's policies of apartheid have created tensions in the region. Not only does South Africa continue its illegal occupation of Namibia; its attacks on Angola are a serious escalation of violence. Finland, together with the other Nordic countries, has strongly condemned the South African military attacks against Angola.\n47.\tSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the basis of a peaceful solution of the question of Namibia. South Africa has committed itself to the United Nations plan for Namibia, which the Council approved by this resolution. Yet, three years have gone by since the adoption of the plan without its implementation. It is understandable that the African nations begin to despair of the prospects for a negotiated settlement. South Africa must be made to realize that its attempts to prevent the independence of Namibia run against its own interests.\n48.\tHuman rights are closely related to peace, security and prosperity in the world. The record of the United Nations in creating a viable code of conduct for nations in the field of human rights is impressive. Genuine observance of human rights in most parts of the world falls well short, however, of the advanced norms to which the States Members of the United Nations subscribe. Human rights must be respected everywhere without any conditions or qualifications. Disregard of human rights is itself a cause of tension within and between countries.\n49.\tOne aspect of the general question of human rights concerns refugees. The international community has been able to alleviate to some extent the suffering of refugees and displaced persons. The International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa, held last April, was evidence of that. Unfortunately, most of the .great human tragedies of our time are deeply rooted in political and military developments. While humanitarian assistance to refugees must continue, the underlying causes must be removed.\n50.\tEastWest political confrontation, to which 1 referred at the beginning of my statement, has pushed the question of NorthSouth cooperation into the background. Yet if we do not urgently tackle the problems of development and poverty we shall be heading towards another confrontation, a confrontation between North and South. The danger of such a development for world peace and stability is manifest. Therefore urgent and determined action is now necessary. This is the responsibility of all Member States of the United Nations. In particular, all developed nations must assume their equitable share of that responsibility.\n51.\tThe dimensions of international economic problems are immense. Population pressures continue; abject poverty, hunger and malnutrition prevail; the human environment deteriorates; and the limits set by the scarcity of natural resources are evident. Radical change is imperative. Priority must be given to mobilizing all our resources for the fight against these problems. This requires structural change in the world economy and increased transfers of resources, as well as a profound change in attitudes and internal economic adjustments, particularly in the industrialized countries.\n52.\tNew efforts must be made to revitalize negotiations on international economic cooperation and development. In this respect, my Government shares the hopes which have been placed in the meeting of Heads of State in Cancun next month. We hope that that meeting will provide new impetus for the launching of the global negotiations by the General Assembly later this year.\n53.\tTwo major United Nations conferences on development have taken place this year. They have demonstrated that significant progress can be achieved through negotiations within the United Nations in areas which are central to international economic cooperation.\n54.\tSustained international economic development cannot be achieved without extensive global cooperation on energy. The United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy held at Nairobi was a first step on that road. Finland will, for its part, work actively for the implementation of the Program of Action adopted by the Conference.3 Increased Finnish development assistance will be allocated for the transfer of advanced technology in the field of energy. In this context, an international symposium organized by the Nordic countries and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] on the financing of new and renewable sources of energy in developing countries will be held in Helsinki in a few weeks' time.\n55.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held at Paris was a success. The Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted by the Conference is an important political recognition of the legitimate requirements of those countries. I pledge the full support of my Government to the New Program of Action. In addition, it is the firm intention of my Government to continue its policy of channeling at least 30 per cent of its bilateral development assistance to the bast developed countries.\n56.\tI should like to recall my statement at the thirty- second session of the General Assembly [10th meeting].\nAt that time, four years ago, I announced my Government's decision to double, over a period of five years, the share of its gross national product allocated to official development assistance. I am happy to state now that according to the budget bill which my Government has decided to submit to Parliament that target will be achieved in 198^. Thus we have practically reached the half way mark towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product, a target to which, my Government remains fully committed.\n57.\tFinally, I should like to draw attention to a specific issue which is both topical and important the problems of disabled persons. The proclamation of this year as the International Year of Disabled Persons reflects the resolve of the international community to work for their welfare as a measure of social justice. Disabled persons, as well as others, are Entitled to full respect for their rights as integrated and equal members of their community. Our main task now is to ensure that the momentum of action generated is sustained after the year 1981. The ongoing work towards a longterm solution of the problems of the prevention of disability and the rehabilitation of disabled persons must be pursued.\n"

        "file_text": "2.\t Mr. President, I should like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are familiar with your reputation as a skillful and experienced diplomat, and that will surely guarantee success in the conduct of these meetings.\n3.\tI am also pleased to congratulate your worthy predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, on the efficient manner in which he discharged his task during his presidency.\n4.\tIt is fitting and proper to pay a tribute to the SecretaryGeneral for his diplomatic tact and for the outstanding and balanced manner in which he has directed the sensitive tasks of the Secretariat.\n5.\tAmerica is in mourning. Romulo Betancourt has achieved immortality. This man, a champion of democracy in Venezuela, overcame party differences to rescue the democratic and social values of his country from the clutches of totalitarianism. Today in their hearts the Salvadorians feel they have lost a friend. The strengthening of democracy in America is a source of solace to us and inspires us to continue his fight. We ask our Venezuelan brothers to permit us to share their grief.\n6.\tWe wish to reaffirm from this rostrum the line that we have followed in fighting for our own national sovereignty and political independence. Consequently, we reject all attitudes of expansionism, hegemony and subjugation. Thus we take note of this twentieth anniversary of the founding of the doctrine and practice of nonalignment, with the authentic and genuine philosophy of which the Government of El Salvador agrees.\n7.\tIn taking stock of international events over the past few months, it is obvious that there is a deficit for world peace. Sources of international tension have multiplied. If we add to this that relations between the superPowers have worsened, we can conclude that the world is taking steps backwards. The struggle between the superPowers to win new areas of influence.and to win supporters of a given political plan in areas far from their countries with different cultural values is largely responsible for the deterioration of the international situation.\n8.\tOn the pretext of giving assistance to nationalist positions, there are attempts to inject ideas or to impose models, covertly at first and openly later, which are not in keeping with the special features of the peoples concerned, using propaganda and subversion, trying to divide society, fomenting class hatred and promoting existing disparities in order then to pose as redeemers of situations in which, as if by magic, underdevelopment disappears and peace arrives. We believe that genuine nationalism  which responds to the conditions of its own environment and therefore rejects any transplant of foreign models, as they are not the product of the needs and desires of a country's nationals must assert itself.\n9.\tConflicts in sensitive areas such as the Middle East seem not only to be becoming permanent but at times to threaten to spread dangerously close to a conflagration of major proportions. When speaking of the Middle East, the ArabIsraeli conflict comes to the foreground. New initiatives in the search for peace are welcome. In this context we support the efforts of Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia as set forth in his proposal of last August. We must not lose sight of the fact that the formula for understanding lies in adequate treatment between the solution of the Palestinian problem, which is the kernel of the matter, and recognition of the security and survival of the State of Israel. El Salvador cannot condone the acquisition of territory by the use of force, nor can it accept threats against the existence of a State.\n10.\tThe development of events in Lebanon, with the violations of territory and the bombings staged there, is one more ingredient in this explosive situation. We can only deplore these acts.\n11.\tIn the same context, we condemn the air attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor.\n12.\tThe Mediterranean area, with its long tradition of culture, is an area that has been a theater of conflicts. However, there is good reason to hope that, thanks to the diplomatic tact demonstrated throughout these many years\nby the United Nations Secretariat, a lasting settlement can be found through inter-communal talks, with the aim of preserving the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Cyprus, its desire to adhere to non alignment, and the harmonious life of its two communities.\n13.\tWhile many local conflicts are becoming more serious, the nuclear disarmament outlook is not promising. The possibility of an atomic world holocaust is present every day, while new arms of mass destruction are developed in a competition between the superPowers to achieve the most sophisticated techniques for annihilation. It has been repeated ad nauseam by many countries in this forum that if a small percentage of the amounts spent on the nuclear arms race were spent instead to finance development, the world would have higher living standards than it has now. If we cannot reverse the nuclear arms race, theft we can only hope that common sense will prevail for the benefit of mankind. The last quarter of a century could be characterized by the fostering of such international scourges as terrorism, but this folly cannot extend to the point at which civilization is destroyed by a world conflagration.\n14.\tOne of the fundamental principles of international law is the repudiation of invasion of national territory by foreign forces. This is a violation of the very essence of the concept of sovereignty. El Salvador could never tolerate the occupation of its territory, whatever the motive or supposed justification, and it is this principle on which it bases its attitude to events elsewhere. For this reason we view with sympathy all recommendations coming from the United Nations or from any other State, without any ideological distinctions, which are aimed at upholding this principle when it is violated. Moreover, it must be kept in mind that when this basic tenet of the Charter of the United Nations is violated, it unfortunately leads, to the human tragedy of refugees fleeing from armed invasions by foreign troops, which constitutes a major human disaster. In accordance with the foregoing observations, we shall support any draft resolution aimed at the cessation of foreign occupation, such as has occurred in Afghanistan and Kampuchea.\n15.\tThe recently held eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, devoted to the question of Namibia, demonstrated once more the dangerous situation for international peace and security created by the conduct of South Africa. Its refusal to comply with Security Council and General Assembly resolutions aimed at the independence of Namibia, together with recent events involving punitive expeditions into the territory of neighboring countries, are a check to the continuing hopes and efforts towards the proposed settlement. Indeed these acts mean an increase in armed conflict and an expansion of the conflict. El Salvador, for reasons of principle, vigorously condemns South Africa's armed incursions, and we urge acceptance of the concept of a demilitarized zone along all these borders.\n16.\tRegrettably, when speaking of South Africa, we must at the same time speak of apartheid, an odious system which persists to this day and is the cause of continuing violence. Consequently, until institutionalized discrimination is eliminated, as a cause of frustration and weakness, bloodshed will continue.\n17.\tPeace and development as abstractions are separate ideas, but in practice they become interdependent in that one cannot exist without the other. Our commitment then must be to make tireless efforts in both directions.\n18.\tAs regards the question of global negotiations, my Government views with sympathy the recent momentum that has been given to initiate the NorthSouth dialog, and we hope that the proposed meetings will yield promising results.\n19.\tOur country favors economic cooperation among developing countries. This is a valuable instrument in the SouthSouth dialog, and we are convinced it will lead to the economic development of our peoples. The agreements reached by the Group of 77 at the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held at Caracas in May this year, deserve our support.\n20.\tAfter arduous and delicate negotiations, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, having made praiseworthy progress in many areas, lost the momentum that it had gained. There is a threat to reconsider the philosophical concept of the common heritage of mankind as regards the seabed, with all the consequences that would ensue. El Salvador, which has made substantial contributions to the negotiations, is very concerned by the line which has been taken, but it is our hope that negotiations will conclude in 1982.\n21.\tThe United Nations, one of whose objectives is to create a system of international peace and security and vast economic, social, cultural and humanitarian programs, must not become a sounding board for propaganda about purely domestic conflicts. This would distort the purposes of the Organization and harm its reputation. Resolutions having no ethical basis, realism or good faith would be mere pieces of paper with no practical content. The road to the revitalization of the world Organization is not through intervention in the internal affairs of a State, or whatever pretext, because what is not permissible for any individual State is also prohibited for several or many States together, in accordance with the rule universally accepted in any code of international conduct that what concerns the institutional structure of a State or its future must be resolved exclusively by that State. The best service that can be rendered to the cause of peace is not to intervene in the internal affairs of another State. Here I would recall Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter, which says:\n\\\"Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter.\\\"\n22.\tIf we wish to strengthen the Organization, we must not yield to demagoguery or extremism. We must not select or exclude topics for ideological reasons. Finally, we must avoid the absurdity of irrational resolutions whose sole purpose is to encourage violent attitudes.\n23.\tThanks to the unremitting efforts and good will of the Government of Honduras and the present Government of El Salvador, on 30 October 1980 we signed a general peace treaty between the two countries. By virtue of this agreement, relations of friendship and mutual respect are at the highest possible level for the benefit of our peoples. El Salvador is at present involved in no dispute to use the term in the Charter with the countries with which we share territorial borders, much less with more distant countries. We have made reciprocal efforts with our Central American brothers to promote plans for cooperation in the isthmus. It must be recognized that in the signing of this international instrument the Organization of American States played an important role.\n24.\tThe regional organizations, which by their very nature, their proximity and the cultural roots of their members can understand more clearly the interpretation of what happens in their respective regions, are called to play a leading role in matters of international peace and security. Political logic requires that they play a primary part, as is recognized by the Charter of the United Nations. Only States with no faith in the moral and legal strength of their arguments will try to repudiate, because of the localization and, gravity of a conflict, an international system which is structured from the regional to the global scale. One result of such mad action could be to disrupt the harmony between regional organizations and the world Organization, with all the dangers that that would involve.\n25.\tTo strengthen international law in toto, we must not weaken the parts that make up the whole. Only in this way can an integrated system function. It has been the constant practice in this world Organization not to deal with situations which have been dealt with in regional organizations. The Organization of American States [Q4S] and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] have carried out exemplary and praiseworthy work in coordination between both spheres.\n26.\tIn the sociological dynamics of a political process, no State, no countries bound by ideological ties or for reasons of opportunism, no international political group has the capability to impose stubbornly its will on another country through control of events there, contrary to the wishes of the majority of its people.\n27.\tFurthermore, full support for the bask norms of international law including, of course, the principle of good faith is a sine qua non for any peace initiatives.\n28.\tIf, because of circumstances in any part of the world, there are events which have given the advantage to certain philosophical or political currents, this does not necessarily mean that neighboring countries must adopt the same course of action, because what might be right for one country might well be a disaster for others. To resist the apparent advantages of immediate political gains, which are merely illusory compared with the legitimate, stable, proper national interests, is a choice requiring a pragmatic, intelligent decision. The long term must be thought about, and not the emotional attitudes of the present. In this choice one must resist those who take advantage of juvenile passions and incite the social hatred of the dispossessed, pushing them towards irredentist violence, like those who wish to return at all costs, using violent means, to a status quo which is no longer relevant because it is unjust. Both forms of conduct are worthy of condemnation because they lead to the destruction of human lives in a fratricidal struggle.\n29.\tIt is never too late to learn the lessons of bitter experience, to turn one's back on irrationality and to move in the direction of concord.\n30.\tEl Salvador is ready to continue to cooperate in a resolute manner to promote an atmosphere of confidence among the brother States of the region, for our international conduct will always show our attachment to the principles of the Charter, principally those that promote mutual respect and respect for the sovereignty of other States and for the principle of nonintervention in internal affairs. No one can legitimately say that my country has violated those principles or provoked conflicts with other countries in the area. We have been tolerant about the attitudes of others when those attitudes were at variance with international law and with the requirements of harmony among sovereign nations, because it is our hope that such behavior will be corrected as a sign of political maturity and respect for international law. It cannot validly be claimed from the ethical, juridical or political point of view that so-called solidarity of organizations or movements which share an ideology is enough to discard the entire framework of fundamental principles of international law which were accepted and agreed to by all the States here when they signed the Charter of the Organization.\n31.\tEl Salvador has endeavored, and will continue to endeavor, to promote genuine cooperation for reciprocal benefits in Central America. My country is aware that in Central America certain political events have occurred which have created different models for economic and social development. In accordance with this philosophy, on 15 August this year, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of El Salvador and the countries of the Central American isthmus signed the Declaration of Tegucigalpa.11 wish to quote certain preambular and operative paragraphs from that Declaration, relating to international cooperation:\n\\\"Considering that those initiatives offer the countries of the Central American Isthmus opportunities that should be exploited, in the understanding that such cooperation is not to interfere with national objectives of any kind or with the manner in which each country proposes to achieve those objectives;\n\\\"1. Reaffirm the intention to work toward integral development of their countries so as to improve the spiritual and material wellbeing of all the inhabitants, within the framework of the development strategy that each of the countries sovereignly adopts;\n\\\"3. Call upon the international community to cooperate with the countries of the Central American Isthmus in internal and intraregional efforts they make to eliminate the obstacles to their development, through concerted and determined action which takes account of the priorities that each of those countries has established, independently of the manner elected to achieve them, and which reinforces the existing coordination and complementation of economic development among the countries in the region.\\\"\n32.\tOur philosophy of regional international relations is one of cooperation and mutual respect.\n33.\tCentral America is more than a region made up of countries; it is a symbol of historic brotherhood and unity.\n34.\tMay I here extend to Belize a warm welcome to the Organization. El Salvador has always believed that Belize because of its special position, the product of history and geography can be the integrating bridge between Central America and the Caribbean. It is our hope that the matters awaiting settlement with the sister and neighboring Republic of Guatemala will be resolved satisfactorily for both parties on the bases of understanding previously negotiated. We hope that they will renew their talks in the spirit of concord and understanding set out in that document.\nA\n35.\tWe wish also to welcome Vanuatu, the other independent State that has recently joined the international community.\n36.\tEl Salvador does not wish to be the subject of a dispute nor shall we allow that to happen. Neither do we wish to be prey to the hegemonistic ambitions of the great Powers, nor do we consider ourselves the natural zone of influence of any State. Our people, proud by heritage and vocation, the product of a miraculous melting pot of mixed races, insists upon being master of its own destiny. We are convinced of the sureness of our people's judgment, and we know that the path of hope lies before us, leading to a more just and more humanitarian society imbued with true social content.\n37.\tWe have emphasized time and again that El Salvador's problems must concern Salvadorians alone. Consequently, solutions must be sought on a national basis, taking into account the idiosyncrasies of the people, democracy as we know it in our country and our search for social justice, essential elements in the consolidation of peace and national harmony.\n38.\tNevertheless, we wish to explain from this rostrum certain aspects of these complicated problems, not to invite any country to meddle in our domestic affairs and thus violate the principle of nonintervention, but that there may be a proper appreciation of what is happening in El Salvador and the path to solution which we Salvadorians consider best.\n39.\tMy Government, in spite of the prevailing violence, has persisted in its determination to build a democratic, participatory and pluralistic society, where man can enjoy a more just and more humane and interdependent life in peace. We have not been deterred by the impetuous attacks of extremists, whose terrorist activities have increased because of the external support they receive from those who want El Salvador to have a totalitarian system.\n40.\tThus we have continued to strengthen the structural changes proven over time, basically consisting of nationalization of the banks and of foreign trade and the most thorough agrarian reform in Latin America, in the firm conviction that with their development and in a climate of peace, they will overcome poverty and the backwardness from which our country has suffered for so long.\n41.\tPolitically, we are already coming to the decisive stage of implementing the electoral process which our Foreign Minister announced barely a year ago in this forum as a means of allowing our people to determine their own destiny in a democratic way for the first time. Not only has the timetable been strictly adhered to, but measures for internal detente have been advanced, the most important being the political draft which, as President of the Revolutionary Junta of the Government, I announced on 15 September last, the date on which we commemorate our independence.\n42.\tThe Government of El Salvador considers that the solution of the present crisis in the country must essentially be political and democratic in nature. We feel that the electoral process, representing as it does a beginning, is the right way to bring about that democratic settlement, whose fundamental element is dialog. It must be an inter-party dialog open to every political party regardless of its ideology.\n43.\tFrom that inter-party dialog the necessary conditions and machinery will be created to ensure the smooth functioning of the democratic process and the proper results of elections. My Government has appealed to every political party and other political groups interested in participating to join in that electoral dialog. At the same time, an appeal has been made to the Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario and Union Democratica Nacionalista political parties which are recognized as such by the law and are part of the Frente Democratico Revolucionario to set aside their hostile attitudes and take part in the inter-party dialog, to debate, study and implement all aspects relating to the electoral process, as the sole democratic solution open to the Salvadorians.\n44.\tThe Frente Democratico Revolucionario has also been invited to cease its armed struggle, become a political party and take part in the electoral process, setting aside its attempt to sabotage, by continued recourse to violence, the results of elections which will be fair, free and legitimate. Consequently, it must choose between the road of peace and the tortuous path of terrorist violence.\n45.\tMy Government's expressed desire for peace and concord completely excludes any negotiations or dialog with organized armed sectors. Of course, any group of that kind which lays down its weapons could participate in the electoral process.\n46.\tIt is that proposal for peace, concord and national harmony that I am placing before all the peoples of the world represented here in this great forum. To all of you, representatives of all countries, I solemnly state that in this great democratic crusade to bring about peace and national unity, we are prepared to devote all our energy, all our goodwill and all our soul to establishing the best possible conditions under which the Salvadorians can determine freely, at the ballot box, the fundamental characteristics of our new homeland, elect a constituent assembly which will have to determine, in a new political constitution, the basic foundations of a democratic, egalitarian, interdependent and just society.\n47.\tThe internal economic, social, cultural and political causes of domestic violence and the present crisis are being, overcome by the necessary structural reforms. We now have a political timetable leading to free elections, which should allow a truly objective solution of the crisis.\n48.\tThese efforts being made by Salvadorians must be accompanied by efforts to eliminate external factors which serve to complicate the problem.\n49.\tMay I express a final thought. The conflicts and differences among the great do not help democracy, but the clamor of the small is necessary for the survival of the ideal of mankind, an ideal that has been muffled by the noises of a materialist civilization which has willfully deprived itself of its eyes and ears.\n50.\tIn this world any clamor may seem useless. I am saying this because I know about the hundreds of millions of men, women and children who gnaw at their despair and struggle in discouragement in so many parts of the world, because the sun never seems to set on the kingdom of injustice.\n51.\tIf God listens the the clamor of the small, why should not the leaders of the great nations, the powerful nations, the developed nations, do likewise? Let them not rely on the fear caused by their weapons and their actions because it is precisely that fear that they should fear.\n"

        "file_text": "Any court of law, any responsible forum, condemns murder. International law also condemns aggression. The killing of children is in particular even more revolting. Ninety-nine children have died in Cuba. They were victims of the hemorrhagic dengue epidemic that took a toll of 156 lives. This epidemic broke out simultaneously in various parts of the country when there had been no news of any cases in other States of the area.\n133.\tIn less than three years our country has suffered the scourge of five grave plagues and epidemics, which have hit our cattle, our plantations and now our people.\n134.\tSwine fever, blue mold in tobacco,, sugarcane rot, hemorrhagic dengue and, more recently, when we were still in the process of fighting off that last disease, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. We are convinced that the imperialists, the agencies of the United States Government, are using biological weapons against the people of Cuba. We all know and it has been published even in\n. United States official publications that the United States has for many years been developing a very wide and sophisticated arsenal of weapons of this type and carrying out many tests for their possible use.\n135.\tWe all know also that the United States, has used these weapons, particularly during its War against the people of Viet Nam, and many are the United State's\\\" veterans of that war who are still suffering in the United States from the effects of exposure in areas near places where such weapons were used.\n136.\tIn the case of the hemorrhagic dengue epidemic, this is a disease produced by the dengue virus No. 2. The' thorough, serious and detailed studies carried put by Cuba's technical and scientific personnel, who have also had the aid and cooperation of highly qualified experts from other countries, have led to the conclusion' that this virus was deliberately introduced into Cuba.\n137.\tAs a result of a systematic and exhaustive analysis of all the available information from health agencies; and institutions as well as from other sources, we have verified that when the hemorrhagic dengue epidemic appeared in Cuba no epidemic outbreaks of the dengue virus No. 2 had taken place in any of the African or SouthEast Asian countries with which we have relations. Our health authorities have determined that no Cuban or foreign citizen coming from those regions or from other areas had suffered from the disease produced by that virus.\n138.\tNor were there outbreaks of dengue virus No. 2 in Latin America or in the Caribbean basin. The last cases registered there date from 1978. On the other hand, we know that the research centers of the United States dedicated to the development of biological weapons have devoted special attention to dengue virus No. 2.\n139.\tWe are firmly convinced that, to the long list of aggressions of all sorts against our people military; economic and political aggressions committed by the Republican and Democratic Administrations that have succeeded one another during 22 years the United States has now added the use of biological weapons.\n140.\tThe President of the Council of State and of the Council of Ministers of Cuba, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, in speeches on 26 July and 15 September of this year, has denounced the perpetration of this unspeakable new aggression against our people by the United States Government. We have requested the distribution to all those here present of these speeches, which contain numerous references to and much evidence of the admission in official documents of the United States Senate and other bodies that, on various occasions, as part of the activities aimed at the overthrow of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba, the preparation of the use of biological weapons was mentioned.\n141.\tThese facts have not been denied by the responsible authorities of the United States Government, in spite  of the fact that President Fidel Castro has challenged them to state before world public opinion whether or not they have' authorized the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] to perpetuate such acts.\n142.\tFor more than 20 years we have suffered from all types of aggression from the United States imperialists, and we have accumulated a vast amount of painful experience. But, as President Fidel Castro has stated, \\\"we do not fear the imperialists' threats. They may perhaps know when to start a conflict against us, but what nobody knows is when and how it will end\\\".\n143.\tIt particularly pleases the delegation of Cuba to see you, Mr. Kittani, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Iraq, assume the presidency at this thirty-sixth session of the General. Assembly. Your recognized ability and experience will enable you to guide our work at this session, which we are sure will be no easy task, for the session is being held in an international climate of tension and turmoil in which the policy of blackmail and imperialist aggression threatens to put an end to the precarious and uncertain peace in which we live today. Fraternal bonds of friendship and cooperation link us with your country, and I can assure you that you will not lack the support of the Cuban delegation.\n144.\tWe extend our warm congratulations to the Republic of Vanuatu on its independence, to which we gave our support within the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and on its having become a full Member of the United Nations.\n145.\tOn 1 September of this year, the twentieth anniversary of the nonaligned movement was commemorated. Its vitality, continuity and fidelity to the cause of national liberation, peace, disarmament, anti-imperialism, anti colonialism, and anti-neocolonialism, its struggle against racism, Zionism and apartheid and its struggle for a just and equitable international economic order have provided the movement with a solid basis for unity and have enabled it to put its stamp of approval on the majority of the most important decisions taken by the Organization.\n146.\tWe reiterate our salute to the 20 years of existence of the movement. To those who would split or destroy it we say that they will fail, that they will find instead that the movement is a powerful instrument of solidarity for the countries of what is known as the third world.\n147.\tWe recall with sorrow that it has not been possible to put an end to the distressing conflict between Iraq and fern. Cuba and its President, Fidel Castro, have endeavored, since the first days of the war and even before its outbreak, to contribute to a peaceful, political, honorable and just solution, Recently, these efforts have been conducted jointly with other ministers of the nonaligned movement, and it is our firm determination to continue to persist in trying to bring about the desired solution to this conflict.\n148.\tAt this, the midpoint of the fourth decade in the life of the United Nations, when one might, think about the triumphs achieved in the implementation of the Charter, as shown especially by the increase in the number of Members of the Organization, that is, the number of countries that have gained their independence and sovereignty when one might think that an international order founded on the principles and purposes of the Charter would by now be given permanent shape, it must be pointed out that the United States Government has cast aside even minimal respect for the norms of peaceful coexistence and the desire for sovereignty of the majority of the States and has laid claim to unacceptable supremacy in all areas of international life, particularly military supremacy, which jeopardizes the carefully wrought structure of peace and international law created in the aftermath of the defeat of the Fascist and Nazi forces in the Second World War.\n149.\tMr. Reagan's Government is striving to impose its hegemony on the entire world and arrogantly claims a special place for the United States that would enable it to decide all questions posed in international relations in favor of United States imperialist interests and its transnational corporations. Not even Washington's closest allies escape ill treatment at the hands of the new United States administration, whose policies affect their economic situation and endanger their territories and peoples with no concern for the misgivings of the governments of those allies, nor for the protests or opinions of their populations.\n150.\tThe facts are irrefutable. The opinions of the majorities irritate the self-proclaimed champions of democracy. Those who arrogate for themselves the right to describe as terrorist the leaders of other countries and the prestigious national liberation movements apply terrorism with their military forces all over the world and place themselves beyond the pale of international legality.\n151.\tWith respect to the legal order to be established on the oceans and the importance of rapidly concluding an agreement as a step towards a new international economic order, after eight years of lengthy negotiations at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the international community has seen with bafflement and indignation how the new United States Administration has rejected the draft convention, ignoring the negotiations already concluded with the participation of the United States delegation and the commitments made, on the pretext of reviewing the text, thus unnecessarily prolonging the work of the Conference.\n152.\tThe participating States now recognize more clearly, in view of the arrogance and aggressiveness of the Government of the United States, as shown by the recent provocations against the sovereignty of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the immediate need for a convention on the sea whether the United States is a party to it or not and even if everyone's aspirations to universality are not achieved an agreement that would sanction internationally the rights proclaimed by many countries over their territorial waters and that would prevent incidents such as that of the Gulf of Sirte.\n153.\tRecently, at the opening of the InterParliamentary Conference in Havana, the President of the Council of State of Cuba, Fidel Castro, affirmed:\n\\\"The United States system is not Fascist, but I am firmly convinced that the group constituting the main core of the current United States Administration is Fascist; its thinking is fascist; its arrogant rejection of every human rights policy is fascist; its foreign policy is fascist; its contempt for world peace is Fascist; its intransigent refusal to seek formulas for honorable coexistence among States is Fascist; its arrogance, its conceit, its arms buildup, its pursuit of military superiority at all costs, its relish of violence and domination, its methods of blackmail and terror; its alliance with Pinochet and with the most brutal regimes of this hemisphere, whose methods of repression, terror, torture and disappearances have taken the lives of tens of thousands of people, often without their relatives even knowing where their bodies lie; and its shameless alliance with South Africa and apartheid are clearly Fascist; its threatening language and its lies are fascist. Never will I say that the people of the United States are fascist, nor their legislative institutions, nor their press, nor their many creative social organizations, nor their strongly enduring, noble democratic conditions and love of freedom.\n\\\"Our hopes are founded on the convention that fascism can succeed neither in the United States nor in the world, although it is true that at present a fascist leadership has established itself in the United States over the structure of an imperialist bourgeois democracy; and this is extremely dangerous.\\\"\n154.\tThe results of the actions of the current United States Administration have already been felt in all their severity in southern Africa, in the Middle East and in the Caribbean, among other regions. Who can deny that South Africa dared to attack Angola because it is certain of support from the United States?\n155.\tThe visit of UnderSecretary Crocker to South Africa and the meeting between Reagan and Botha, which received such widespread publicity in the United States, as well as the statements rejecting the defense of human rights and the marked interest in making the Pretoria racists fee! they are part of a strategic alliance with the United States, made it possible for them to step up their military and subversive actions against the front-line States and particularly against Angola and Mozambique.\n156.\tWho can deny that the United States veto of the condemnation of the aggressors against Angola and of sanctions against them constitutes proof of its encouragement and support of the illegal and hateful apartheid regime? The aggression against Angola seeks to extend apartheid's frontiers. It is an aggression not only against Angola but against the whole of black Africa and especially against the countries of southern Africa. The racists must withdraw from southern Angola and stop their acts of hostility against the rest of the front-line States.\n157.\tIsrael is another fundamental link in the strategic alliance advocated by Washington. As in' the case of Pretoria, the Zionist authorities felt that, with Reagan's accession to the White House, their finest hour had arrived and they decided to take advantage of it promptly. The Zionists' main objective is still the same; the genocide of the Palestinian people and its disappearance as a nation. The.. Nazi methods suffered yesterday by the Hebrew people are employed today by Begin against the heroic Palestinian people.\n158.\tWe are certain that the heroic struggle being waged by the Palestinian people, led by the PLC), its sole legitimate representative, will be victorious and that nothing can prevent that people from establishing its own independent State in accordance with its inalienable rights.\n159.\tThe bombings of Lebanon, the aggression against the peaceful nuclear research, center in Iraq, a deed unprecedented in peacetime, the threats against the Syrian Arab Republic and Jordan events which have all taken place in the few short months since the inauguration of the new Yankee Administration these are indications of the consequences of the strategic agreement recently concluded in Washington by Reagan and Begin, aimed at confirming the role of Israel as a pivot of Yankee world strategy.\n160.\tIn the Caribbean and Central America, the United States, in addition to using bacteriological methods against the population, the crops and the cattle in Cuba and giving the green light to the CIA to renew and step up its plots against the lives of the main leaders of the Cuban Revolution and its subversive and destabilizing actions, has intensified its interventionist and genocidal acts in El Salvador, arming and advising a terrorist Government that has murdered over 20,000 children of that noble and heroic people.\n161.\tThrough its vast propaganda machinery, Yankee imperialism, resorting systematically to the most brazen and shameless lies, accuses Cuba of being the cause of the instability in Central America. It is not Cuba but Yankee imperialism that has imposed and protected unpopular and obnoxious Governments whose only virtue has been to protect the system of economic exploitation of the peoples of the region. It is imperialism, with its direct or indirect military intervention through reactionary regimes, which must assume the responsibility for the absence of peace in Central America.\n162.\tThe Government of Cuba has publicly denied that some of the weapons delivered to it by the Soviet Union are being redistributed in Central America. It has affirmed that it is a lie to say that Cuba is supplying any other weapons or ammunition to the Salvadoran patriot and that there are or have been Cuban advisers in El Salvador. These are the facts and, as facts,' they are irrefutable, which does riot imply either a commitment or a moral judgment on the right to give military aid to the forces struggling in El Salvador against the junta, forces whose political representativeness has been recognized by France and Mexico and has just been proclaimed, by an overwhelming vote, by the countries participating in the 68th InterParliamentary Conference.\n163.\tWhat is not a lie and cannot be denied by the United States leaders is that military and police advisers from the Governments of the United States and Venezuela are training the genocidal forces of the Christian Democratic Junta of Et Salvador; that the Salvadoran military is being taught the techniques of repression by Pinochet's Fascists in Chile; and that it is with Yankee helicopters, Yankee aircraft, Yankee weapons and Yankee bullets that the Salvadoran people are being murdered.\n164.\tIn a cry for justice based on the principles of international law and the interests of the nations and peoples of the world in search of peaceful solutions to the hotbeds of tension that poison the international atmosphere, the Governments of Mexico and France agreed to recognize the representativeness of the patriots of the National Liberation Front and the Democratic Revolutionary Front, thus trying to reach a negotiated and political solution to this bloody drama. Showing its real interventionist intents and purposes, the United States reacted violently against the FrancoMexican initiative and, using its allies in the Government of Venezuela, compelled these pseudo-democrats to join the worst tyrannies of the continent in a condemnatory statement. Pinochet, Stroessner, Herrera Campms, all in the same bag, with Reagan leading them by the hand, are trying to obstruct the search for a negotiated and political settlement to the civil war in El Salvador.\n165.\tWe wholeheartedly hail Belize's accession to independence after a long struggle to thwart the annexationist intentions of the oppressors of the Guatemalan people and we are pleased to see that in a few hours, Belize will become a full Member of the United Nations.\n166.\tIn Puerto Rico the clamor for an end to that island's colonial status, is increasing. The vast ^majority of the Puerto Rican political organizations, not only those seeking independence, demand that the General Assembly consider Puerto Rico's case at its thirty seventh session, as was approved at the recently concluded session of the decolonization Committee. Cuba supports the right of this brother people to independence and is sure that, in the fulfillment of its obligations, the Assembly will not deny to the Puerto Rican people the right to have its tragic situation considered.\n167.\tCuba has always supported the legitimate aspiration of the Argentine people to see the Malvinas Islands come under their national sovereignty, as well as the just demand of the Bolivian people to have an outlet to the sea.\n168.\tWe also support the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination.\n169.\tIn Western Sahara, the Sahraoui people has through its heroism earned the respect and admiration of the whole world. We support its unshakable will to achieve self-determination and independence.\n170.\tAs a consequence of colonialism, Mayotte has been artificially withdrawn from Comorian sovereignty and Madagascar has not yet recovered its rights over the Malagasy islands of Glorieuses, Juan de Nova, Europa and Bassas da India. We trust that the speediest solution can be found for these anachronistic situations.\n171.\tJust as the self-determination of a people cannot be prevented, so a nation cannot be kept artificially divided. The presence in and virtual occupation of South Korea by the United States prevents peaceful reunification and the end of foreign interference in Korea. The Korean people has built a prosperous and happy country in the north under the leadership of its President, Kim II Sung, and is imbued with the noblest ideals of reunification of the divided homeland.\n172.\tCuba supports the Government and the people of Panama in its struggle for the implementation of the agreements on the Canal and supports the Guatemalan people, which has risen up in arms against the cruel tyranny imposed on it since the United States intervention of 1954.\n173.\tCuba likewise supports the efforts of the people of Cyprus to preserve its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity as a united and nonaligned republic.\n174.\tIn SouthEast Asia, we believe that only a negotiated solution can put an end to the existing tensions. Cuba has fully supported the proposals of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea to hold a regional conference for that purpose, with the participation of the other States of the region. At the same time, we emphasize our unswerving recognition of the sole legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people: the People's Government of Kampuchea.\n175.\tAs Chairman of the movement of nonaligned countries, Cuba has lent its good offices and today renews its willingness to continue to do so in the search for a negotiated political solution to the situation in SouthWest Asia. Such a solution should, in our opinion, entail the end of intervention and interference in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, together with the necessary international guarantees, and the creation of conditions permitting the normalization of relations among all States in the area on the basis of the principles and purposes of nonalignment.\n176.\tThe second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament will be held in 1982. We all remember that, at the time of the first special session, the heads of State of the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] met in Washington and, under pressure from the United States Government, proclaimed their readiness to increase their arsenals. This inauspicious sign allowed us to foresee that progress in the implementation of the decisions adopted by the tenth special session of the General Assembly would be meagre. Since then, the United States has continued to take steps to achieve military superiority, although it becomes clearer every day that its NATO partners are resisting this Yankee pressure for political and economic reasons.\n177.\tThe increase of war expenditures to unprecedented levels, the reduction of the budget for social expenses, applying the painful practice of less butter and more guns, the creation of rapid deployment forces, the decision to install 572 medium-range missiles in Europe, the production of the neutron bomb and of the MX missile system, the increase in the number of nuclear aircraft carriers and Trident submarines, the reactivation of large warships, all are actions which serve to unleash an arms race whose end is impossible to predict.\n178.\tWe are sure that the United States will try its utmost to prevent the convening of the forthcoming special session devoted to disarmament. Even if it is held, the prospects for United States cooperation and contribution to its success are dim.\n179.\tIn June of this year, the People's National Assembly of Cuba expressed its strong and resolute support for the appeal made by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet\nUnion to all parliaments and peoples of the world concerning the critical international situation, aggravated as it has been by the dangerous increase in the arms race It was reiterated in that decision that \\\"peace is essential in the struggle for development, since the struggle for peace is tantamount to the struggle for development and implies the uprooting of the deep inequalities still extant as a result of colonial and neo-colonial domination, racial discrimination, racism, Zionism and apartheid\n180.\tThe nonaligned countries, who took the initiative to convene the forthcoming special session, will strive for the success of this new session of the Assembly. Cuba promises to contribute to that cause and hopes that that session will become a battleground for universal peace and the renewal of detente.\n181.\tMy delegation also supports the important proposal submitted to the Assembly by the Soviet Union on the prevention of a nuclear catastrophe through a solemn commitment by all States possessing nuclear weapons, and their leaders, not to be the first to use them in case of conflict.\n182.\tI should like now to refer to one of the most transcendental problems confronting the world today, namely, the international economic situation.\n183.\tCuba has upheld and upholds the view that peace and development are indivisible elements of international relations. We can talk about peace, disarmament and international security; we can take action to limit arms or to ban certain weapons; but we will not really have attained an effective and lasting solution to the tensions, conflicts and contradictions that threaten the world until we find a way of guaranteeing the complete and permanent elimination of inequality among nations through the establishment of a new system of international relations, one that will allow the beginning of a just and equitable new international economic order.\n184.\tThe situation now facing the majority of the developing countries is not new; it has been progressively deteriorating for more than 20 years. However, now, in the middle of the greatest crisis that the capitalist system has suffered in the postwar period, that deterioration has become increasingly swift and far-reaching.\n185.\tThe international agencies, and in particular the ones belonging to the United Nations system, have outlined innumerable plans, adopted many resolutions and convened several conferences to deal with the problems of economic and social development. In all of them, the problems which afflict the countries of the so-called third world have been clearly identified, and in some of them measures have been suggested which, although they do not fully solve these problems, would certainly contribute to lessening their effects. However, in spite of the efforts made, these ideas and initiatives have not made it possible to advance towards a real restructuring of international relations.\n186.\tHas this perhaps been because of the incapacity of the international organizations involved or the negligence of the developing countries, for whom the effective implementation of a new international economic order is a matter of life and death, or because of the shortage of resources at a global level which prevents the developed countries from fulfilling their obligations to the developing countries? No, these have not been the causes of the failure of the international economic negotiations. This failure has stemmed and still stems from the narrow and intransigent policies and practices of a group of developed capitalist countries which, headed by' the United States, persist in maintaining the privileges and bonuses they have enjoyed for centuries in their relations with the developing countries at the expense of the exploitation and poverty of the latter.\n187.\tNever before in the history of mankind have the underdeveloped countries seen themselves submitted to such merciless exploitation and such a marked economic penetration as at the present time. The leaders of the developed capitalist countries have endeavored to transfer to the developing countries the effects of the crisis generated by their own structures. The dependency of the developing countries on the economies of the western metropolises has increased to an unprecedented level, through the spiral of external debt, through the continued generation and exacerbation of unfair trade flows, through limiting the access of the third-world countries to the markets of the world and to the technology and the resources available to the capitalist West, through the preservation of unfair and disorderly international monetary relations, and through promoting in the economies of the countries of the developing world an increasing penetration by transnational corporations, which add iniquitous financial profits to practices and policies harmful to the sovereignty, stability and integrity of the countries in which they operate.\n188.\tThe policy followed by the Government of the United States clearly exemplifies what I have just stated. The high interest rates decreed by the Reagan Administration, besides being ineffective in solving the structural crisis of the American economy and harming even the western allies of the United States, impose a new and heavy burden on the underdeveloped countries, raising to unsuspected heights the already unbearable cost of servicing their colossal debts. Furthermore, the United States advocates as a policy a considerable increase of foreign private investments in the developing countries as a sort of magic wand to solve their economic problems.\n189.\tNothing could be further from the truth, as the following figures show: between 1970 and 1978, United States investments in the third world reached a total of $8.7 billion, while in the same period the profits of that country from those investments were of the order of some $39.7 billion, representing a profit of $4.5 on each newly invested dollar.\n190.\tThese dollars, then, contribute nothing towards paying the debts of the countries of the developing world; they do nothing to help feed the hungry, cure the sick, educate the illiterate or give work to the unemployed. Their sole use is to fill the bottomless vaults of the transnational corporations and the Federal Government of the United States.\n191.\tIs that the way to fight underdevelopment and all its consequences? No. Actually, that is an inverse transfer of resources, from the developing countries to the developed market economy countries, the effect of which is the ever-increasing enrichment of opulent societies and the increasingly abject poverty of the underdeveloped countries!\n192.\tthus, there are today in the developing world 570 million undernourished people, 800 million illiterate adults, 1.5 billion people with no access to medical care, 1.3 billion people with a yearly income of less than $90, 1.7 billion with a life expectancy of less than 60 years, 1,030 million living in inadequate housing, 250 million children who do not attend any school and 1.1 billion unemployed. And this situation is not improving; it is deteriorating.\n193.\tAt the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly, in October 1979 [31st meeting], Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, President of the Council of State and the Council Ministers of Cuba and Chairman of the movement of nonaligned countries, presented formulas to provide a solution to the unfair situation of the underdeveloped countries. In addition to the cancellation of the external debt of the least developed countries, he proposed the establishment of an additional fund of not less than $300 billion, at 1977 real value, to be distributed from the first years in annual sums of not less than $25 billion. This aid should be in the form of donations and longterm, low-interest soft credits, and other forms of participation.\n194.\tThe real implementation of this proposal would indeed represent in spite of the self-seeking doubts of those who characterize it as unrealistic benefits for the underdeveloped countries and . a true contribution to the eradication of poverty, illiteracy, unsanitary conditions and other consequences of underdevelopment, which have been aggravated by the crises of the capitalist structures. However, in order to carry out a significant battle against underdevelopment, it is essential to have an international political climate governed by peace, detente and full respect for the security of all.\n195.\tFor these reasons we must oppose the arms race, the manufacture of neutron bombs, the deployment of the 572 medium-range missiles in Europe, the production of the MX missile systems at a cost of tens of billions of dollars, of new strategic bombers, of nuclear aircraft carriers, of Trident submarines, the reactivation of big warships from the Second World War, the investment of $1,500,000,000,000, in military expenditures in the next five years, and the greatest arms race in history, as engineered by the United States.\n196.\tThese enormous military expenditures, which can only serve to aggravate the world economic crisis, will have negative repercussions on the living and working conditions Of the working class and can only lead mankind to an unprecedented catastrophe.\n197.\tThe threat of war is real. It is no secret that the brazen, adventurous policy of the imperialist Government of the United States has pushed the world to the brink of the abyss.\n198.\tAs was stated by President Fidel Castro in his opening,, speech to the 68th InterParliamentary Conference:\n\\\"We must face these real dangers serenely and courageously. We cannot afford to be pessimistic, for then the battle for peace would be lost beforehand. We cannot be cowardly, for then dignity as well as peace would be lost beforehand. We can and should preserve peace without yielding an inch, backed by the mobilization of the peoples, including those of the United States, and by the immense power of world opinion and the universal conscience, as shown during Viet Nam's heroic struggle; by the current correlation of forces between socialism and imperialism, which the latter vainly seeks to tilt in its favor; by the people's capacity and determination to fight and resist any imperialist aggression; by international solidarity, which can and should be expressed in a thousand different new ways.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "150.\tAt the outset, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Vanuatu and Belize on their independence and welcome them on their admission to the United Nations. On behalf of the Government and the people of Israel, I wish them success and prosperity as independent and sovereign States.\n151.\tThe Government and the people of Israel have always upheld the ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It could not have been otherwise, for Israel's intellectual and moral traditions have given birth to some of the most important elements inherent in the shape and meaning of the Organization. The brotherhood of man, social justice, the rule of law both domestic and international the equality of nations, the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the outlawing of war those and other ideals had grown and taken root among the shepherds and peasants of Judea and Israel long before they came to be accepted as principles of current international life.\n152.\tUnfortunately, these ideals have been honored more in the breach than in the observance in the practice of the United Nations. In recent years the Organization has repeatedly permitted itself to be abused by Israel's adversaries who enjoy a built-in majority in the Assembly on any issue related to the ArabIsraeli conflict. In recent years Israel has more than once been the victim of discriminatory treatment in the United Nations.\n153.\tIt must be stressed that international organizations which allow their fundamental rules to be violated cause severe damage to themselves and thereby undermine their very raison d'etre. Decisions arrived at in disregard of the relevant provisions of constitutional instruments are illegal, however often repeated and however overwhelming the majority that supported them.\n154.\tThe distortions which pervade the United Nations system have also manifested themselves in the attitude of the Organization towards the Camp David accords and the treaty of peace between Egypt and Israel. By any yardstick, the conclusion of peace between two former enemies is surely not only a legitimate but also a desirable development which should have been welcomed by the United Nations, the primary purpose of which is the promotion and maintenance of international peace. No third party, including the Assembly, has the legal or moral authority to question, let alone to deny, the validity of the accords attained or of any treaties deriving from them,\n155.\tA major issue that has rightly engaged the attention and growing concern of all mankind is that of international cooperation for development and the widening gap between the standard of living of the poor nations and that of the wealthy nations. However, the NorthSouth dialog has remained largely a debate among nations and groups of nations, and, as might be expected, those suffering hunger and deprivation have not had their lot improved by this debate.\n156.\tFor the last 20 years Israel has been involved in the effort to develop ways and means of raising the standard of living in the less developed societies. It is our wish and we believe that it is within our capacity to make a further contribution of our own to joint efforts to tackle specific development problems and advance towards a solution.\n157.\tEver since its establishment Israel has had to cope simultaneously with a wide range of grave social, economic and security problems. We have absorbed and integrated hundreds of thousands of immigrants many of them victims of persecution in the Arab countries from which they had come and at the same time set about creating a progressive and rapidly developing society. With all the urgent problems that weighed upon us, we have spared no effort in cooperating with other young developing nations in such fields as agriculture, hydrology, rural development, health and youth leadership. This fruitful process of international cooperation with dozens of countries, regardless of political outlook, has been constantly moving forward.\n158.\tIn their continuous search for solutions to the evolving challenges of development, Israel's experts have recently formulated some new ideas on development, referred to by them as the Transitional Economy Plan. It is a model for empirical dynamic development, well within the means of the countries concerned. I wish to take this opportunity to invite the attention of the General Assembly to document A/36/497, circulated at the request of my delegation, which contains a report entitled \\\"An Outline of Development through Promotion of the Transitional Economy\\\". We do not claim that this plan is a panacea for all the world's economic ills. Rather, it aims at applying a gradual, step-by-step, relatively low-cost program of improvements to the rural sector of society, a sector that so far has not been given sufficient attention. We will be happy to cooperate with any national or international organization for the purpose of putting the concepts contained in this plan into practice.\n159.\tAt the thirty-fifth session [15th meeting], we appealed from this rostrum to the Soviet Government to remove all the limitations and obstacles hindering Jews in the Soviet Union from leaving for Israel. Already at that time there were grounds for fearing that the Soviet Union was going to close its gates to those Jews. Unfortunately, those fears have since been substantiated. Over the past year we have been watching with growing anxiety the steady decrease in the number of Jews leaving the Soviet Union to the lowest number for the last 10 years. The Soviet Union is thus forcibly preventing many thousands of them from living in their homeland.\n160.\tIn parallel, we have witnessed again a regrettable increase in the violation of fundamental human rights in the Soviet Union. Over the past six months the number of prisoners of Zion detained under false pretexts and sentenced by Soviet courts to long prison terms has doubled. The sole crime of these people is their desire to live as Jews in their own land. Ida Nudel, Victor Brailovski, Anatoly Shcharansky and others have been gaoled for that desire, while others who have been refused exit permits have been subjected to pressure to refrain from so-called antiSoviet activity. The Assembly should know that the antiSoviet activity in question consists of the study of the Hebrew language and of the reading of books on Jewish history and Judaism.\n161.\tFrom this rostrum I wish to appeal once again to the Soviet Union to reopen its gates for Jews who wish to return to their homeland and to cease the persecution of the Jews in the Soviet Union.\n162.. There are also other countries in which Jews have been subjected to discrimination and oppression. In particular, 1 must again express anxiety over the condition of the tortured Jewish community in Syria, whose human rights are severely curtailed and many of whom have been imprisoned and have had their property impounded. I would thus also appeal to the Government of Syria to respect the basic human rights of its Jewish community, which it holds hostage and which it prevents from leaving.\n163.\tPermit me to turn now to the subject of the nuclear menace posed by Iraq. The item on the agenda of the Assembly dealing with the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor has been formulated in a manner clearly intended to prejudge the outcome of the debate. As has been stated by Israel, the decision to destroy that reactor was taken only when it became absolutely certain that Iraq was on the verge of producing nuclear bombs, the principal target of which would have been Israel. People in all parts of the world, including the Middle East, are sleeping more soundly today, secure in the knowledge that that particular reactor has been removed. Iraq's nuclear reactor had to be destroyed before it became operational in the summer of 1981, for its destruction at a later date would have brought about radioactive fallout, endangering the civilian population of Baghdad.\n164.\tEver since the establishment of the State of Israel, Iraq has been conspiring against it, both politically and militarily. Iraq set out to acquire nuclear facilities and expertise and then proceeded to assemble all the ingredients required for the development of nuclear weapons. This indicated a calculated effort on the part of Iraq to embark on a nuclear weapons program, Our concern about the Iraqi nuclear program was shared also by authoritative foreign governmental and professional assessments. None the less, six years of diplomatic and public efforts to bring about the cessation of the Iraqi military nuclear program yielded little more than reference to IAEA inspections under the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Iraq is a signatory. Israel has had to conclude that a country which acquired a complete fuel cycle and is openly bent on the destruction of Israel will not balk at going ahead with its program, whether or not it is a party to the NonProliferation Treaty.\n165.\tLet me take this opportunity to reiterate Israel's policy that it will not be the first country in the Middle East to introduce nuclear weapons into the region. Faced as it is with the stark realities of the Middle East, Israel must insist on distinguishing between spurious and genuine safety. As the case of Iraq has clearly demonstrated, the NonProliferation Treaty cannot effectively prevent such a country from resorting to nuclear weapons so as to achieve what more conventional means have failed to do.\n166.\tThe only genuine way to remove the nuclear threat to the Middle East can be found in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, freely and directly negotiated among the countries of the region and based on mutual assurances, on the pattern of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. In the Assembly we shall continue to advocate and support constructive steps genuinely advancing the prospect of a Middle East free of nuclear weapons. At the same time, we shall warn against, and oppose, steps designed to exploit this subject as a tool of antiIsrael political warfare.\n167.\tThe situation in Lebanon has been a source of grave concern in our region for a number of years. That country has been subjected to strife and bloodshed from the mid-1970's onwards, due to the exploitation by Syria and by the PLO of domestic rivalries in Lebanon, followed by outright invasion of the country by the Syrian army. The situation has been worsened by the tightening of the PLO's grip on large parts of the country. Furthermore, in order to promote their regional strategic aims, the Syrians have subjected the Lebanese civilian population to brutal attacks which have brought about the destruction of a large portion of the country. Some 120,000 Lebanese civilians have been the victims of Syrian and PLO atrocities. It is characteristic of the double standard practiced in international relations that these atrocities have never been condemned by the international community, including the United Nations. Arab and Soviet bloc supporters of Syria and the PLO have made any such condemnation impossible.\n168.\tIt is our hope that an independent and free Lebanon will soon reemerge and maintain good relations with all its neighbors, including Israel. But this will be very difficult to achieve as long as the PLO is allowed to nest in Lebanon and to hatch schemes aimed at promoting international terrorism and the mounting of brutal and cowardly attacks against the civilian population of Israel, especially in the northern part of our country. There will be no end to the tragedy of Lebanon as long as the Syrian occupation continues and as long as the PLO maintains its terrorist bases in Lebanon, supported by armaments from foreign Powers, mainly the Soviet Union and Libya. The Government of Israel will at all times support the reestablishment of a truly independent Lebanon, within its internationally recognized boundaries, free of Syrian occupation and PLO terror.\n169.\tThe main cause of the ArabIsrael conflict has always been the refusal of Arab States to accept the existence of an independent and secure State of Israel and their avowed commitment to its destruction. The events of the last four years have brought about a major breakthrough in that respect: after Egypt abandoned the path of war and announced its readiness to negotiate peace, peace inevitably followed. Furthermore, while the winds of war have been constantly blowing in other parts of the region, Egypt and Israel, which not long ago were faced with the imminent danger of war, are now learning to coexist in peace and represent an island of stability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, this is not yet the case with regard to the other Arab neighbors of Israel. These Arab States, which have been invited by the signatories of the Camp David framework for peace to join the peace process, have so far refused to do so.\n170.\tOne of the clearest manifestations of their categorical opposition to the peace process is their continuing and unprecedented military buildup through arms purchases from the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc nations, as well as from the United States and Western Europe. Since 1978 the major Arab countries, excluding Egypt, have concluded arms deals valued at $27.8 billion, of which $11.6 billion worth has already been delivered.\n171.\tThese acquisitions of arms reflect a formidable quantitative and qualitative military buildup in those countries. These arms are unfortunately intended primarily for use against Israel. Needless to say, the stepped-up arming of the Arab States serves to strengthen their conviction that the ArabIsrael conflict can still be solved by military means. Moreover, it jeopardizes the internal stability of several of the Arab regimes, as well as of the region as a whole.\n172.\tThe Camp David accords have been and remain the only feasible path to peace; no other viable solution appears on the horizon. Just last week we resumed the negotiations with Egypt, with the participation of the\nUnited States, on the establishment of full autonomy for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district. We hope to bring these negotiations before long to a successful conclusion.\n173.\tOur people were not handed their State on a silver platter. We fought for liberation against a colonial Power. We then had to fight against a host of Arab armies that sought to prevent the establishment of our State. Subsequently, we have fought four more wars to defend it. We know very well the meaning and the price of combating colonialism, of a struggle for liberation and of fighting for self-determination.\n174.\tThese concepts are now being abused and exploited by a number of Arab Governments in the name of the Palestinian Arabs. The Palestinian Arabs do have a State on a major part of the territory of Palestine. In Jordan, there exists a Palestinian Arab State in everything but name. It is a Palestinian Arab State by virtue of its geography, demography, history, culture, religion and language. It has even been declared as such by an impressive number of Palestinian Arab and Jordanian leaders, There is thus no need to speak further of Palestinian self-determination; their homeland is already in existence. Moreover, in 1964, when the PLO approved the so-called Palestinian National Covenant with a view to \\\"liberating\\\" Palestine, at a time when Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district were still under Jordanian and Egyptian occupation, the real goal of the Arab States was to \\\"liberate\\\" Israel from Israelis, to deprive Israel of its existence. That aim is still fervently pursued today under the cover of the slogan of a \\\"homeland for the homeless Palestinians\\\", which is given immense publicity by Arab propagandists and their supporters.\n175.\tIsrael firmly believes in a vision of peace for our region and will strive towards its realization. The Middle East is rich, not only in history and in spiritual and cultural assets, but also in immense natural resources and manpower. The people of Israel has as much to offer for the development and progress of our region as have the other neighboring peoples, each in its own way.\n176.\tThe Jewish people has reestablished its home in the land of its forefathers, where the Kingdoms of Judea and Israel flourished for centuries. We have now restored our sovereignty over this area after 19 centuries of homelessness, with Jerusalem, which has always been the center and sole focus of the national and spiritual life of the Jewish people, as the undivided and indivisible capital of Israel\n177.\tWe have returned to the land of Israel and have come there to stay. Together all the nations of the Middle East can usher in an era of real peace and cooperation in the region. The opportunity is there. Let us not miss it.\n"

        "file_text": "199.\t Sir, I should like first of all to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. You have spent almost a quarter of a century in this Organization, as a representative of your Government and as an official of the United Nations Secretariat. You have an enviable reputation among your col leagues. They regard you as a person of high intelligence, of great ability and of unquestionable integrity, and there is no doubt that you will lead this session with fairness and efficiency.\n200.\tI should also like to pay a brief tribute to your immediate predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany. He presided over the thirty- fifth session of the General Assembly with efficiency, fairness and punctuality.\n201.\tIt also gives me great pleasure to welcome a fellow-member of the Commonwealth-, Vanuatu, as the 155th Member of this Organization. /\n202.\tToday, another country, Belize, gains independence, and I look forward to welcoming it also to this Organization.\n203.\tThis session of the General Assembly is the thirty- sixth since the United Nations was founded. This Organization was born out of revulsion against the horrors of the Second World War. It was with high hopes that the first 51 Members met in San Francisco to inaugurate this body. Since then we have been able for 36 years to avoid a world war, but world peace has evaded us. The cost of resort to force against each other and the fear of a nuclear holocaust have kept the super-Powers from being locked in a direct war. The recourse to war by them seems less likely. Among the industrialized countries, the perceived margin of safety seems to have increased as their fears of attack by one another have receded. Yet the fact remains that local wars and proxy wars have been raging every where since the end of the Second* World War. What we are really going through are times of troubled peace.\n204.\tStudents of the subject tell us that since the end of the Second World War there have been more than 100 wars and military actions between nations. Millions have died in these conflicts and, in fact, more have died in conflicts since 1945 than in the Second World War. Many more have been maimed and made homeless. Millions have been dispossessed and have been living as refugees, becoming endemic problems to host countries. Those who are victims of these conflicts and others who are cynics may well ask whether the United Nations has been of any use at all. To those of us who think that it has, the more pertinent question is, perhaps, what would have been the experience of the world without the United Nations?\n205.\tThere are many of us who feel that the United Nations, in order to be an effective security organization, must be able to intervene in conflicts on the side of the victim against the aggressor. We wish that the United Nations could be a supranational body with the capacity to impose peace. This assumes that the great Powers that are Members of this Organization will act in unity and out of a common perception when faced with matters of war and peace. This, in fact, was the underlying assumption be hind the founding of this Organization that the cooperation of the great Powers would make collective action possible. Our experience, sadly, is that this has not materialized. Collective action has not been possible except in a few and rare instances.\n206.\tFrom a number of great Powers at the founding of the United Nations, we have today two super-Powers. Every conflict involving any two or more nations is seen either as an opportunity to advance the interest of one super-Power or as a danger to the interest of the other super-Power. The United Nations, where the super-Powers are supposed to co-operate in collective action to ensure peace, has instead become a cockpit of rivalry between them. They use the United Nations to further their interest in whatever way possible.\n207.\tThus the United Nations has not been able to act directly to bring about peace in armed conflicts except, as I said, in rare instances. Are we therefore wasting our time here? Is this just a charade on stage with no bearing on real events? I do not believe so, because if we did so believe, most of us would not be here.\n208.\tMost of us here are small nations. Ninety-seven of us have a population of less than 10 million, and 90 of us have a gross national product of less than $US 10 billion. Unfortunately, many of the conflicts in the world involve us, the small nations.\n209.\tFor us, the United Nations offers the most effective forum in which to highlight our problems of peace, to bring pressure to bear on militant nations and to work towards a solution in a conflict. It is in the United Nations and through its numerous organs that our diplomats and officials deal directly with one another. Through this process we have become more sensitive to each other's concerns. As others have said, our agenda now goes beyond mere questions of security and territory. We are concerned with problems of energy, environment, population, resources and even our seas. We the small nations need the United Nations all the more to protect our interests, and it is to our advantage to use and develop the United Nations machinery. We have to search for new and more effective ways to mobilize and express the view of those who are exercised by a problem.\n210.\tIt is for that reason that small nations have, from time to time, resorted to this Organization to solve their problems, be it the Middle East problem or problems in Africa, Afghanistan or Cambodia. For instance, on the Kampuchean problem, the overwhelming majority of United Nations Members have felt sufficiently strongly about it to call for an International Conference on Kampuchea. The attendance at that Conference confirmed the continuing concern of the international community with this problem. The Conference's Declaration and resolution provide a reasonable framework for a solution to the problem.\n211.\tI believe that the United Nations has played and can play a role in matters of war and peace. The decisions in the United Nations and the moral pressure of the collective stand of the majority of the Members here can help ensure not only that an aggressor nation pays a high price, but that it is denied the fruits of its conquest. When the protagonists in a conflict and the super-Powers or other outside Powers indirectly involved in the conflict find that the price of their action is high, they can be led to see that it is in their interest to bring the conflict to an end. Through the United Nations, a face-saving way out of the problem can be provided. These are vital roles that the United Nations can play.\n212.\tWith the \\\"one State, one vote\\\" norm, the United Nations has made it easier for us, the small countries, to link our strength and to exert the moral pressure that United Nations Members can collectively bring to bear upon a recalcitrant Member that pursues an expansionist policy.\n213.\tNations, like men, are interdependent. They are members of a community. They desire a place in the community of nations which will bring co-operation, re-spect and even approbation. Through the United Nations, we can deny a nation a place if it transgresses the principles of the Charter of the United Nations to which it sub-scribes. The United Nations may be unable to stake armed action collectively, but by the decisions and principled positions that we take here we can impress on potential aggressors that the use of military force in resolving dis agreements or expressing disapproval is unacceptable.\n214.\tThe resolutions that we pass here with regard, to such matters may at first glance appear to be mere words. But they can influence real events. Apart from denying a recalcitrant Member an honorable place among nations, the opinion of the United Nations, embodied in its resolutions, creates the moral ambiance for others to resist the actions of the aggressor nation. In such cases, it gives those who take up arms against a violators the right to do so. It also provides justification for others among the world community to help the victims resist the aggressor with aid of one kind or another. The opinion of the United Nations fortifies and encourages both those who directly resist and those who help in the resistance.\n215.\tMoral support and assistance to those who sustain the resistance against an aggressor does help, for it not only gives strength to the victim but also provides sustained international pressure on the aggressor. Over time, the aggressor will have to find a face-saving way out of the situation.\n216.\tWe who gather here annually, therefore, can play an important role in the peace process by our pronouncements on issues, provided those pronouncements are credible and based on fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. If we trade support for issues with out regard for principles or allow the interests of big Powers to determine our position, we will lose all credibility.\n217.\tOn two of the questions which have engaged the General Assembly for the last two years\u2014Cambodia and Afghanistan nearly two thirds of the Members have been unequivocal in their stand. In both cases, the majority of United Nations Members have taken the position they have because they have been able to see clearly that there has been armed invasion and occupation of small nations by other, larger, nations, with either direct or indirect participation of a permanent member of the Security Council of this Organization. It is a delusion to think that two thirds of the Members here are acting at the behest of other Powers. The justification has been offered that foreign forces were invited by the victims, but these have been shown to be spurious.\n218.\tIt is not surprising, therefore, that those who find themselves in the dock in the United Nations today on these two issues dismiss the resolutions of the United Nations against them as irrelevant and of no consequence. Yet, the records will show that those who dismiss the resolutions tried to win the approval of this Assembly for their actions in Cambodia and Afghanistan. Having failed to win the support of this Assembly, they now dismiss the resolutions as of no consequence. It is perhaps forgivable when a new member of this Organization expresses his belief that United Nations resolutions can be ignored. But it gives reason for concern when a permanent member of the Security Council urges Members of this body to ignore its pronouncements and recommendations as en-shrined in various resolutions. It becomes a matter of even greater concern when a large country and leader of the non-aligned movement is publicly on record as saying that: \\\"These overwhelming majorities mean nothing. We have had so many overwhelming majorities. . . . These votes do not mean anything.\\\"\n219.\tFor the past two years, the majority of us have not been taken in by such gratuitous advice. On the other hand, we have adopted resolutions which have in fact condemned Viet Nam for actions which are in breach of United Nations principles. Similarly, in Afghanistan, the invasion and occupation of a small non-aligned nation by a super-Power stands condemned in this Assembly.\n220.\tThe debate and resolutions in the Assembly have over the past two years demonstrated to patriotic Cambodians and Afghans that they arc not alone and that they have not been forgotten by the world community. The United Nations has by its pronouncements given the moral basis and encouragement for others to help these patriots.\n221.\tWe, therefore, in this Assembly must continue to focus attention op these and similar problems, such as the South African occupation of Namibia and the South African incursion into Angola. And we have to focus attention not only in the General Assembly, but also through special conferences, like the International Conference on Kampuchea.\n222.\tWe the Member States should not, therefore, hesitate to mobilize ourselves to condemn any violation of principles of the Charter of the United, Nations. At the same time, a way out of the problem must be offered. It is the least we as a body can do to encourage those who courageously resist aggression and strive to preserve their national independence and uphold the principles of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "44.\t Speaking as I am after the passing of the Egyptian head of State, allow me first to associate myself with the homage that has been paid to his memory. The tragic death of President Anwar El Sadat is a cruel loss, not only for his country, but for the United Nations and for all who are working to achieve peace and love between peoples, to which aim he dedicated himself with unshakeable faith and exceptional courage. To the sorely bereaved delegation of Egypt and, through it, to the fraternal people of Egypt, I address our heartfelt condolences and sincere compassion.\n45.\tSir, in electing you to the presidency of its thirty- sixth session, the General Assembly has acquired the experience, competence and effectiveness of a seasoned diplomat that you have always shown, both in the service of your country and in the United Nations. I am happy to extend to you, on behalf of my delegation and in a personal capacity, our heartfelt congratulations, assuring you again of my high and very friendly esteem.\n46.\tAs you begin your important task, I should like to express to your predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, our high appreciation for the brilliant manner in which he dis-charged his duties.\n47.\tI should also like to express once again to the Secretary-General our deep gratitude for the exemplary devotion with which he carries out his important responsibilities.\n48.\tOver the years, the United Nations has ceaselessly reaffirmed its universality. Since it is the framework par excellence for co-operation and reconciliation between human communities, we are highly appreciative of that fact. We therefore welcome the entry of Vanuatu and Belize to the United Nations. We regret that some States are not yet members, although they have become members of the specialized agencies, and we invite them to join us.\n49.\tThe Ivory Coast hopes that in the near future the United Nations will be welcoming a member, the independent State of Namibia. We reaffirm our support for Security Council resolution 415 (1978), which provides for Namibia's accession to independence and self-determination through the organization of free elections undo: United Nations supervision.\n50.\tThe implementation of that resolution has been too long in coming. Any further delay would be intolerable and would have heavy consequences for peace and security in that region. It is time for the killings and tortures in Namibia to stop, as well as the massacres of innocent populations in the States that are neighbors of South Africa, particularly in Angola, by the South African Government and the bombings which it carries out, sowing death and desolation in peaceful villages, as well as that country's repeated violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of those States contrary to the dearly held principles of the United Nations and condemned by the international community.\n51.\tTo avoid the risk of being accused of attempting to sanction South Africa's delaying tactics, of laxity and, consequently, of complicity, the five members of the contact group must unequivocally reaffirm their determination to do everything in their power to implement resolution 435 (1978), which does no more than reproduce the plan they themselves worked out in answer to the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people to freedom and human dignity. In drawing up that plan, they assumed a commitment to the international community to ensure that Namibia accede to independence in a peaceful manner. They have the means to achieve this. They are in duty bound to succeed, for if that plan is not implemented, the ensuing disappointment will be commensurate with the immense hope that they have aroused throughout the world, and particularly in Africa.\n52.\tIt is with satisfaction, therefore, that we who have trusted in them from the outset and have supported their plan, note that following their meeting in New York on 24 September, they reaffirmed \\\"their determination to pursue their efforts\\\" to \\\"assure without further delay a peaceful solution to the problem of Namibia\\\".\n53.\tUnfortunately, there is another problem that constitutes a treat to peace and security in southern Africa: apartheid, that odious system based on the segregation of human beings according to race, that ensures the reign of the minority over the majority and that deprives that majority of human rights and fundamental freedoms, debasing them solely because they are not white.\n54.\tThe strikes that have been called in South Africa and the acts of violence that have taken place in that country in recent years are ample proof that the majority is awakening and rejecting its present status.\n55.\tLike clouds preceding a storm, rancors, hatreds, feelings of frustration and revolt, are piling up. The longer the scourge of apartheid goes on, the greater the danger of confrontation between the white minority and the majority of the South African community. Each day that goes by brings us closer to war and its consequences destruction of human lives and property, foreign interventions and the risks of the conflict's being extended.\n56.\tIt is clear that the so-called \\\"homelands\\\" or bantustanization policy of the Government of South Africa is not capable of preventing such gloomy prospects, lacking as it does popular support and disapproved of as it is by the international community. This could not be otherwise with regard to a policy that allows the minority to enjoy exclusive control of the country's principal resources and confines the majority of the population in one seventh of its territory on less productive land. It is obvious that the solution to the problem is to be found only in the participation, on an equal footing, of all the inhabitants of South Africa in determining their future.\n57.\tSome, considering the measures adopted thus far as insufficient to eliminate apartheid, and becoming impatient, advocate a recourse to war to achieve this; an understandable attitude, but one which should not exclude the use of other means.\n58.\tWe think? indeed, that it is possible to prevail upon the Government of South Africa peacefully to bring about the changes that are desirable in that country. We can never over-emphasize the special responsibility incumbent upon the Powers which have economic relations with that country. We appeal to them resolutely to embark in this direction, because their long-term interests are at stake, and so as to avoid the problem of apartheid degenerating into armed conflict and opening up the way to foreign interference in Africa.\n59.\tWe want Africa to be really neutral, to be free from foreign interference in its affairs. We are convinced that, left to themselves, Africans can resolve their differences. The Ivory Coast therefore welcomed the progress achieved by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in the quest for a peaceful solution to the problem of Western Sahara.\n60.\tTo our mind, what we should do, now that the principle of self-determination of the people of Western Sahara has been acknowledged by all parties concerned, now that the organization of a referendum has been agreed upon during which the United Nations is required to give its assistance, now that practical ways to implement this have been defined, and a progressive relaxing of tension in the region is taking place, is to avoid debates and decision which would revive passions, provoke an escalation of fighting and frustrate the efforts of the OAU to bring about a peaceful solution to the problem.\n61.\tIt seems to us that the United Nations should confine itself to taking note of the agreement which was reached this year in the OAU at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government and in the Implementation Committee on Western Sahara, and to invite the pan-African organization to pursue its efforts. The parties concerned should co-operate honestly in implementing the self-determination process. We urge the African countries in particular to facilitate, as is their duty, the very delicate and complicated task of the Implementation Committee.\n62.\tRespect for the right of peoples to self-determination should be admitted in other situations of conflict as well. The United Nations in 1947 recognized that the Palestinians had that right, and since 1947 the Palestinians have been deprived of it. The Palestinian problem is at the core of the Middle East conflict. As long as the Palestinians do not exercise their right to self-determination and the consequent creation of their own State, this region will continue to be the theater of ever-renewed crises, sporadic fighting, repeated attacks, assassinations and violence, to which Ms distressing tragedy has Accustomed us. We have grown used to this almost permanent state of war. We have grown used to a sword of Damocles hanging over international peace and security.\n63.\tThe major obstacle to the exercise of the Palestinians of the right of peoples to self-determination seems to be the absence of mutual and simultaneous recognition of their existence and that of the State of Israel. We Welcome the approach made in that direction by Saudi Arabia. We venture to hope that this initiative will be welcomed by all parties concerned and by the Powers involved, and that it will give new impetus to efforts already undertaken to bring about a comprehensive peaceful solution to the conflict.\n64.\tAlmost two years ago the United Nations proclaimed its indignation and condemned the invasion of Afghanistan by foreign forces which, as in similar situations, reminded us sadly of coups de force in the past and re-established the climate of the cold war which, we believed, had gone for ever. Recalling the principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and the right of peoples to self-determination and, in particular, to decide their own form of government and to choose their own economic, political and social system without intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint from outside in whatever form, the General Assembly requested the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan [resolution ES-6/2 ]. It renewed this request last year at the thirty-fifth session [resolution 35-37], but for almost two years now Afghanistan has been occupied by foreign troops, obviously against the will of the Afghan people.\n65.\tThe situation prevailing in that country is disturbing for more than one reason. It has caused the displacement of people who look for shelter in other countries, in particular in neighboring States. Whatever action is undertaken, bilaterally or multilaterally, to assist them, will be only a partial solution to a phenomenon which has political, social and economic consequences. The situation creates a danger of confrontation between the great Powers. It also hampers the development Of that third world country. It constitutes an extremely dangerous precedent for the progress and security of a large number of developing countries.\n66.\tTo prevent such situations, there is only one reliable method: the neutrality of the developing countries towards the two blocs. That means that peace must reign between these countries and within each country, and in order to do this they should resort to permanent dialog to settle their disputes, whether internal or against one another. This means the practice of a true policy of non-alignment towards the great Powers.\n67.\tWhat the developing countries need are not imported ideologies but technology and resources for their economic, social and cultural development. What they .want is not to be the pawns in this political rivalry between the great Powers, but to see that rivalry become strictly financial, economic and technical. What they would like is the establishment, for their benefit as well as that of the developed countries, of international cooperation to resolve a fundamental problem of today, namely development.\n68.\tToday in the developing countries 1.8 billion people live in poverty, and it appears that 800 million will find themselves in a state of absolute poverty in 1990 unless we are careful. Now in these countries two out of three people die of hunger Seventy per cent of the children suffer from malnutrition, a billion people are condemned to illiteracy, three quarters of the population of the earth have only one fifth of the word's income. In the developed countries, on the other hand, one quarter of the people possess four fifths of that income; a human being will rarely suffer from hunger and will receive an education to a level at least equal to that of secondary education, and the majority have a life expectancy of SO years at least.\n69.\tHie efforts to bridge this gap are frustrated by the short-term instability of commodities markets which manifests itself in severe annual price fluctuations. The trend is usually downward and therefore export earnings drop. This has had an adverse long-term effect on markets. Between 1950 and 1970, the price ratio for primary products sold by the developing countries and manufactured products sold by the developing countries went down by 35 per cent. In 1981 a ton of cocoa, coffee or cotton to take only these examples in the best possible circumstances only buys half of the capital goods, particularly agricultural capital goods, that could be bought 20 years ago.\n70.\tCommodity price fluctuations and deterioration of the terms of trade have, for the developing countries, severe financial consequences which jeopardize their ability to save, invest and therefore to develop, but the two phenomena also have consequences for the developed countries.\n71.\tIndeed commodities from developing countries as a general rule are processed in the developed countries before being consumed. A drop in commodity prices discourages producers, makes them reduce their output and finally creates supply difficulties at the industrial level in the processing countries, not to mention the unemployment which might result.\n72.\tSome developed countries producing raw materials or synthetic goods also suffer from the deterioration of the terms of trade. Differences in cost structures often bring activity to a partial or total halt. Some coal basins in Europe, following the continued fall in oil prices from 1960 to 1972, are a case in point.\n73.\tAs we see, excessive price fluctuations and the deterioration of the terms of trade are the cause of economic waste for all countries, whether developed or developing, and this demonstrates a major fact of our times, the growing interdependence between national economies.\n74.\tThe solutions which haw so far been put forward to solve these two problems have not been entirely satisfactory. The compensatory financing machinery\u2014STABEX, a tool of IMF\u2014is aimed, as its name suggests, at compensating for the nominal losses in export earnings from commodities, but unfortunately, it does not compensate fully. Furthermore, it does not cover the loss in the purchasing power of export earnings due to inflation.\n75.\tThe so-called price stabilization agreements seek to avoid excessive price fluctuations that would jeopardize the long-term interests of producers and consumers, and to stabilize and increase export earnings for the producer countries. However, where they exist, these agreements promote the first aim better than the second. Furthermore, difficulties arise when it comes to determining the minimum and maximum prices to be fixed, which provide the benchmark for the application of the stabilizing action, as can be seen in the International Cocoa Agreement.\n76.\tThese difficulties are due to the way the stabilization agreements are conceived. Generally, from the consumer's point of view, they are conceived not as a means of ensuring effective price stabilization but as an instrument to maintain free market conditions, in accordance with the wishes of those who think that commodity prices should result from market forces. To be sure, this market is effectively free of any State intervention. But can one say that it is a free market when the means to market these products are more or less out of the hands of the developing countries, when, at the pre-marketing stage the economic decisions are not taken by those countries; in brief, when the market is dominated by the importers, distributors, processors and a whole gamut of middlemen from the developed countries whose activity is often exclusively financial, and only very distantly connected with the product concerned..\n77.\tIn addition, how can one offer the developing countries the argument that the market forces must be given free play, when those who put forward that argument refuse to apply it whenever their products are threatened by competition from products originating in other developed countries? Is that not a tacit admission that a free market is one in which right is right? That amounts to recognizing both the need to correct the short-comings of the market and the legitimacy of the desire of developing countries for a policy ensuring remunerative prices for their commodities.\n78.\tFurthermore, attainment of the objectives of the stabilization agreements is hampered by the lack of adequate funds for the operation of the machinery provided for that purpose: buffer stocks and stocks established by producer countries to ensure fulfillment of their export quotes. The Common Hind for Commodities will make it possible to remedy this situation, if its reliability is guaranteed.\n79.\tThe idea of setting up this kind of machinery bears witness to the need for more co-operation among all countries in order to solve the problems inherent in the imbalance of trade in general, and in the commodity trade, in particular.\n80.\tApart from trade, the development of the poor countries is meeting with obstacles in the industrialization sphere. If those' countries are to develop some of their industries, they must find markets for their products. But access of those products to the markets of the developed countries is hampered by a protectionism running counter to the laws of free trade and by the unilateral setting of exorbitant freight rates. In 1978 the industrialized countries imported from developing countries manufactured and semi-manufactured products to the value of only $32 billion, as against $125 billion in the opposite direction, that is, a cover rate of 390 per cent. This is a regrettable situation, since, industrialization in the form of processing before export of some of their raw materials would provide the developing countries with relatively stable export earnings.\n81.\tThose countries are also having difficulty in acquiring, adapting and disseminating industrial techniques, and when transfers of technology take place, they often have onerous conditions attached, are badly adapted, or provide elementary or obsolete technology. International negotiations aimed at organizing relationships between developed and developing countries in a just and equitable manner, in particular through the preparation of a code of conduct on transfer of technology and revision of legislation on patents, have made scarcely any progress.\n82.\tThe financial resources required for the industrialization of developing countries greatly exceeds their internal savings capacity. Official aid is well below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product recommended by the United Nations. From 0.35 per cent in 1975, it has fallen to a level of 0.31 per cent in 1978. furthermore, the high level of indebtedness of the developing countries, the continuing rise in energy costs and the declining trend in export earnings means that much of the aid they receive and the loans they contract go to reducing their debt burden and paying for their oil bills, instead of to new projects.\n83.\tBecause of such obstacles, the industrialization of the developing countries is making slow progress. The share of those countries in world industrial production was only 7 per cent in the 1960s; it has risen since then, but was only 9 per cent in 1977. Taking the broad view, those obstacles also have consequences for the developed countries.\n84.\tBy providing considerable subsidies and buying up part of their output, Governments prolong the existence of firms which cannot compete with similar products from developing countries. Thus protectionism leads to higher prices, which are a burden to the consumer, and in the long run, to inflation and losses for the economies of developed countries as a whole. Furthermore, to block exports from developing countries means reducing their capacity to import and in the final analysis to preventing the creation of more productive employment in developed countries.\n85.\tStudies have shown that although initially increasing imports of finished and semi-finished goods from developing countries can cause employment problems in some sectors of the economy of developed countries, at a later stage it should enable them to increase their exports in other sectors, a process leading to an upsurge in the world economy. It is therefore in the mutual interests of developed and developing countries for obstacles to the industrialization of the latter to be removed and for world industry to be restructured with a view to an equitable division of labor. That aim can be attained only through international co-operation.\n86.\tThe disorder in the monetary system since the general floating of major reserve currencies authorized by IMF in 1976, which has resulted in wide fluctuations in exchange rates, is also hampering the developing of the poor countries. Bearing in mind the instability of the currency market and the prevailing uncertainty there, transfers from multilateral financial institutions and private sources are too burdensome and ill-suited to the specific needs of those countries, and are subject to the harmful effects of the floating of reserve currencies, like their export earnings, quite apart from the fluctuations in commodity prices.\n87.\tThe developed countries responsible for this monetary disorder have not been spared. The increase in interest rates is leading to a slowing down of investments and growth and, finally, to unemployment in those countries.\n88.\tAny new monetary order aimed at more stable international currencies will make sense only if it takes into account all economic interests, and if all States participate in its management. Thus, wherever one turns, it seems that the developed countries cannot obtain prosperity by themselves; that they must, by way of efficient international co-operation, help the poor countries towards development and that, in so doing, they are both helping themselves and working for peace, for the poverty of the developing countries gives rise to disturbances, political instability, foreign interference and international tension.\n89.\tWhat framework could be better than the United Nations for such co-operation? This sentiment reflects the hope which we place in the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development, which will take place at Cancun, for launching global negotiations. We also hope that the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, to be held next year, will be the start of a new awareness of the obstacle represented by the arms race, that will make it possible to mobilize additional resources for development.\n90.\tIt is inconceivable that military expenditures should have grown year after year to reach in 1981 the astronomical figure of $500 billion, whereas development aid is falling, and is only $20 billion. It is repugnant to see that the resources devoted to works of death are 25 times as great as those devoted to works of life, and that the program of WHO for the eradication of malaria, which represents only one thousandth of military expenditures, should lack funds and the cost of the 10-year program to cover the essential needs of food and medical care should be less than 50 per cent of these expenditures.\n91.\tMay the Cancun Meeting and the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament pave the way to international co-operation within the framework of the United Nations, bringing peace and happiness to all, thus justifying the very reason for the existence of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I wish to extend the most sincere congratulations to you on your fitting choice to preside over the present session of the General Assembly. Your lengthy career in the field of international relations, as SecretaryGeneral of the Ministry of External Affairs of your country, as representative of Iraq at many sessions of the General Assembly, as representative of your country and as a senior official of the Organization, provides ample assurance that your skill and experience, acquired over many years of praiseworthy service, will enable you to obtain successful results in the exercise of your important function.\n155.\tI likewise wish to express our appreciation to the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Riidiger von Weehmar, a most worthy representative of the Federal Republic of Germany^ who carried out his important functions with forthrightness and tact and with the spirit and devotion of one who is imbued with the ideals of the United Nations.\n156.\tI also wish to express my appreciation to the SecretaryGeneral, who has unceasingly pursued the path of peace and whose report to the General Assembly at this session is a document which illustrates very well not only the grave problems which the international community faces, but also possible alternative solutions. Above all, it is an urgent and clear appeal for negotiation and understanding to preserve peace and promote development.\n157.\tWe cordially welcome the new Member State of Vanuatu, which wUl undoubtedly make an excellent contribution to our endeavors.\n158.\tThe situation in 1981 has been characterized by the persistence of tensions between the great Powers, the renewal of armed hostilities in several regions and a highly discouraging stagnation in the global economic negotiations which are necessary to restructure the world economy and thereby promote a universal solidarity which will ensure international peace and security.\n159.\tTensions are basically due to distrust, attempts at hegemony and the persistence of unjust situations which are contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and make it difficult to apply the mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes, to which all Member States are bound and to which Honduras has always adhered.\n160.\tThe arms race makes the world we live in increasingly dangerous. A tendency daily to improve on or invent new weapons of destruction does nothing but heighten insecurity to the same degree, and thereby distrust, thus giving permanence to the spiral of terror. On the other hand, it is only fair to say that every ^nation has a legitimate right to provide itself with appropriate means of defense. From that standpoint, it should be to the search for regional balances and effective negotiation of multilateral disarmament measures that we should direct the efforts of the United Nations.\n161.\tAccordingly, Honduras supports a careful and appropriate preparation for the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, scheduled for 1982, and we welcome the submission of new proposals at the session of the Preparatory Committee which has recently concluded.\n162.\tNevertheless, one cannot expect progress in the various disarmament areas, nor will guarantees of fulfillment of the program for disarmament be achieved unless at the same time the safeguard mechanisms for the peaceful uses of atomic energy are improved.\n163.\tHonduras, which has at all times supported the peace scheme for the Middle East, laid down by the Camp David accords, once again reiterates its conviction that all efforts fully to carry out those accords with due thoroughness and promptness should be supported.\n164.\tWe believe that since the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai is about to be carried out, we should proceed to the next stages of withdrawal by Israel from the occupied Arab territories and a start on the process of Palestinian autonomy on the West Bank of the Jordan and in the Gaza Strip.\n165.\tWe must be aware that the treaties between Israel and Egypt are in jeopardy, not only because of the delay in their implementation, but also because of the dangerous climate of open hostility which has prevailed in Lebanon for several years.\n166.\tIn this very forum Honduras has on several occasions reiterated its solidarity with the Lebanese people and the urgent need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon. We therefore sincerely believe that all the parties directly involved should meet together as soon as possible to arrive at a broad understanding which will consolidate the precarious ceasefire negotiated last July.\n167.\tHonduras has viewed with concern the continuing conflict between Iraq and Iran and sincerely deplores the fact that this conflict is causing untold human and material losses. We therefore hope that, in accordance with the premises of international law and the principles which govern peaceful coexistence among States, the parties to the conflict will promptly find a solution so that normality will once again prevail in that part of the world.\n168.\tAs regards Afghanistan, Honduras, in conformity with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, wishes to support the initiatives which the SecretaryGeneral may take in seeking a negotiating context for the Afghan question which will in the first place eliminate the causes of insecurity for the neighboring countries and subsequently assure Afghanistan's genuine independence.\n169.\tAs regards Kampuchea, our country actively participated in the International Conference convened by the SecretaryGeneral in compliance with General Assembly resolution 35/6. Although we regretted the absence of Viet Nam and of the socialist countries, attendance by more than 90 countries and the attention given to the Conference by the international community confirm its importance as an adequate instrument through which to find a just solution to the delicate situation created in the IndoChinese peninsula.\n170.\tThe Conference remains open; its first stage was concluded by the setting up of the necessary machinery to bring positions closer together, on which reports will be submitted to the Conference, and by the adoption of an important Declaration of which we emphasize the following: first, Kampuchea has the right to be independent and sovereign, free from any external threat or aimed aggression, free to pursue its own development and a better life for its people in an environment of peace, stability and full respect for human rights; secondly, with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement, negotiations between the parties must include a ceasefire and withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea under the supervision of the United Nations, appropriate arrangements to ensure that armed Kampuchean factions will not be able to disrupt law and order, and the holding of free elections which, also under the supervision of the United Nations, will ensure the establishment of a new government.\n171.\tIn Latin America we suffered in 1981 the painful loss of the head of State of Panama, General Omar Torrijos, a statesman of outstanding personality, who led his country in crucial moments of its history. He was the driving force in the struggle by the Panamanian people for full recognition of its sovereignty over the Panama Canal, which he admirably achieved, after an intelligent and patient effort, through the 1977 Treaty and the Protocol thereto, signed with the United States of America and entered into force in 1979,8 which, as is known, constitute one of the cornerstones of the renewed and growing relations of friendship and cooperation between the United States of America and the countries of Latin America.\n172.\tAs is well known, there is at present in Central America a serious situation of political, economic and social crisis which in recent years has erupted into armed explosions which have caused and are causing the loss of countless human lives and property in brother countries. This grave crisis situation, with its origins in the present order, requires determination to find solutions to bring about the transformation of the present societies into dynamic economic communities in the full exercise of a living and effective social justice.\n173.\tThe Government of Honduras, in the midst of these internal convulsions in brother countries with their possible repercussions for the international order, urges a return to peace and harmony among the parties to the conflicts, who should strive to find solutions to their problems as soon as possible.\n174.\tAt present, our country enjoys internal stability, not as a result of repressive attitudes but because of the Honduran people's appreciation of its Government's measures with their emphasis on social welfare, such as advanced labor legislation and at: agrarian reform law, the diligent and effective application of which has already benefited and will continue to benefit in the future a high percentage of our rural population. furthermore, the people of Honduras enjoy unrestricted freedom of the press, which has been internationally recognized and praised. All the inhabitants of our nation enjoy the right publicly to express, through the mass media, their ideas, thoughts and criticisms, without any censorship or fear whatever.\n175.\tFor more than a year efforts were made with a view to convening a meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Governments of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama and Honduras aimed at reactivating regional dialog and establishing the basis for the setting forth of common Central American positions in the face of international economic problems, thus promoting not only the development of each country but also effective cooperation among them. Those efforts were crowned by the holding of the meeting of the ministers of Central American countries at Tegucigalpa on 15 and 16 August 1981. The results of that meeting are recorded in an important document known as the \\\"Declaration of Tegucigalpa\\\", in which, inter alia, the ministers:\n\\\"(1) Reaffirm the intention to work toward integral development of their countries so as to improve the spiritual and material wellbeing of all the inhabitants, within the framework of the development strategy that each of the countries sovereignly adopts;\n\\\"(2) Decide to take maximum advantage of intra regional cooperation to benefit the various internal development efforts, to facilitate and encourage equitable trade, to undertake new development projects whose execution can be facilitated by dealing with them collectively, and to re-adapt the formal instruments of Central American integration to current needs;\n\\\"(3) Call upon the international community to cooperate with the countries of the Central American isthmus in the internal and intraregional efforts they make to eliminate the obstacles to their development, through concerted and determined action which takes into account the priorities that each of those countries has established, independently of the manner elected to achieve them, and which reinforces the existing coordination and complementarity of economic development among the countries of the region;\n\\\"(4) Agree, so that the aforementioned external cooperation can be implemented as soon as possible, to establish a forum where the countries of the Central American isthmus, either individually or collectively, may explain their international cooperation needs to the sources that might provide them that cooperation, without prejudice to the arrangements that each country initiates, maintains or continues to maintain with those sources.\\\"\n176.\tIn accordance with what was established by the Declaration of Tegucigalpa, a working group met in the Honduran capital on 24 and 25 August this year. It included representatives of Central American Governments and the Government of Panama and prepared a proposal for the establishment of a group on cooperation for the economic and social development of the Central American isthmus.\n177.\tFollowing the course agreed upon at the meeting of the ministers of the Central American countries and of Panama, the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica informed the States participating in the meeting held at Nassau on 11 and 12 July 1981 of the contents of the Declaration of Tegucigalpa and invited them to participate in a preparatory technical meeting with the Central American countries. That meeting took place on 7 and 8 September at San Jose, with the objective of requesting the countries that signed the Nassau Declaration to join the countries of the Central American isthmus in their joint proposal to increase the volume of international technical and financial cooperation sufficiently to enable the Governments of the isthmus to face the adverse economic situation in which, for various reasons, they find themselves, to obtain resources granted on concessionary terms so as to be consistent with the debt capacity of the recipient countries, to adjust the acquisition of technology to be used as a result of the financing obtained, and to see to it that all this forms part of a plan for external cooperation directed to the countries of the Central American isthmus which would contribute to reactivating the process of economic and social development in all those countries.\n178.\tThe representatives of the countries of the isthmus welcomed the participation in the meeting of representatives of the Governments of Canada, the United States, Mexico and Venezuela, who expressed their firm and determined support for what they described as the praiseworthy initiatives adopted by the States of the region for the development cf greater cooperation and economic integration with a view to the establishment of the appropriate institutional machinery and the mobilization of resources from outside the region in order to achieve faster and more effective economic and social development in Central America.\n179.\tThe people of Honduras are at present engaged in a democratic electoral process. The freely elected Constituent National Assembly is drafting a new constitution for the Republic and has already handed down the legal instrument creating the electoral organization and the rules governing the civic campaign which will result in the election of members of the municipal corporations of the Republic, deputies to the National Congress, the President of the Republic and officials attached to the office of the President.\n180.\tFour political parties are participating in the present electoral campaign, together with independent candidates. This gives our citizens the greatest possible freedom to select those who in their view would best serve the interests of the country as members of the Government. The Government and people of Honduras are thus showing their faith in democratic institutional solutions and their conviction that the power of the vote is greater and better than violence for the transformation of societies. The armed forces are fully discharging their constitutional duty to guarantee the citizens their right to express their will by voting.\n181.\tI am pleased to inform the General Assembly that on 30 October 1980 Honduras and El Salvador, in the city of Lima, signed a general peace treaty which put an end to the conflict which for more than 11 years had kept the two brother peoples apart, and that on 10 December of the same year, in Tegucigalpa, there was an exchange of the instruments of ratification of that legal document at a solemn ceremony which was honored by the* presence of the Presidents and heads of State of Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela, who, with delegations from other countries of the continent and of Spain, accompanied the President of Honduras, General Policarpo Paz Garcia, and two members \\\"Of the civilian military junta of El Salvador, Mr. Napoleon Duarte and Colonel Abdul Gutierrez, in that historic event that demonstrated to the world that a frank and sincere dialog and the rules and principles of international law are the best means of settling disputes among States.\n182.\tWith other countries of the isthmus, Honduras maintains cordial relations of cooperation and coexistence within the legal framework which has always governed its international life. The meetings of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of representatives of the Central American Governments, to which I referred earlier, bear witness to the fact that understanding and the desire for unity are the bases of the course chosen by the Central American States.\n183.\tAs a consequence of various resolutions adopted by the United Nations and by the Organization of American States a few days ago Belize emerged into independent life. Honduras hopes that the new Central American entity will base its actions on the patterns of democracy and extends its best wishes to that people.\n184.\tDuring one of the various stages of the search for a solution to the dispute between the United Kingdom and Guatemala over the territory of Belize, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of those two countries and the Prime Minister of Belize signed a document entitled \\\"Heads of Agreement\\\". In one of those Heads, Guatemala is granted the use and enjoyment of the Cayos Zapotillos. The Cayos Zapotillos historically, geographically and legally belong to Honduras.\n185.\tFor this reason, Honduras submitted to the Government of the United Kingdom, with which we Maintain very cordial and friendly relations, a note of protest at the alleged cession of a sovereignty which belongs to Honduras. Honduras hopes and trusts that by means of direct negotiations, or by any other means open to us under international law and international institutions, a just solution to that problem will be found.\n186.\tOur country continues to give humanitarian assistance to close to 35,000 refugees who have arrived from neighboring countries because of the situations prevailing in those countries.\n187.\tHonduras will continue its humanitarian policy as far as that is possible and wishes to express its sincere gratitude for the cooperation it has received from the UNHCR, the World Food program, UNICEF, the Evangelical Committee, World Relief, OAS and some friendly Governments, both on the American continent and on other continents, which have made generous contributions.\n188.\tHonduras strives to overcome the economic and social problems which afflict our country, but our efforts need to be complemented internationally. Accordingly, Honduras, represented by a delegation which I had the honor of presiding over, participated in the HighLevel Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held in Caracas from 13 to 19 May under the auspices of the Group of 77. Horizontal cooperation among the nations of the developing world opens new and broader perspectives for the adoption of coordinated regional and international economic policies and facilitates the introduction and implementation of specific cooperation projects in areas of priority importance for the developing countries. In this respect, Honduras continues to benefit from the agreement on energy cooperation for Central America and the Caribbean established by Mexico and Venezuela.\n189.\tThe forthcoming International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held next October at Cancun, is of great importance and we hope that the dialog of the heads of State and Government who will be attending will take further indispensable decisions to carry out vigorous cooperative action for development. We believe that in the global discussions the united voice of the countries of the Central American isthmus should be heard, as a reflection of both the spirit that prompts them and their needs and objectives.\n190.\tWe are concerned about a possible reduction or freeze in the forthcoming years in the supply of funds for multilateral financing institutions, because that would immediately affect the viability of the many projects scheduled for the next five-year period at a historic time when tension and insecurity might lead developing countries to greater levels of poverty, unemployment and disorder.\n191.\tAs regards the law of the sea, regrettably, despite the advances achieved after protracted negotiations, in which Honduras participated wholeheartedly, on the signing of a universal treaty On the law of the sea, when we were already very close to concluding that process and were about to sign the draft convention, there emerged difficulties and positions so far removed from the very premises of the negotiations that today we must contemplate the possibility of having to conclude a convention in 1982 without some of the most important maritime Powers being party to it.\n192.\tThe Government of Honduras a few days ago associated itself with the decisions taken at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, which dealt with the question of Namibia. We are following with grave concern the setback in the negotiations between the five Western Powers and the Pretoria regime to implement the plan for free elections and the accession of Namibia to independence recommended by the United Nations, in particular in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\n193.\tAs we see it, the question of the deployment of forces within the Territory and the question of security for Namibia's neighbors continue to be of singular importance if a peaceful and complete solution to this problem is to be found. At this stage Honduras believes it is indispensable to renew the political will so as not to prolong further the paralysis of the independence plan. On the contrary, and with the full support of the international community, there should be prompt negotiation of practical arrangements that will facilitate the holding of truly free elections in the Territory in 1982.\n194.\tThe foreign policy of Honduras continues to conform to the basic principles which confer fundamental value on respect for human beings, the practice of democracy and the quest for the economic and spiritual progress of the population of the country. On this special occasion I wish to place on record our consistent adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and again appeal for the strengthening of the peaceful means.for the settlement of international disputes as the most appropriate way to achieve the purposes of the Organization, in particular the maintenance of peace.\n"

        "file_text": "At the eighteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, which was held at Nairobi in June, my colleagues bestowed upon me the great honor and high responsibility of the chairmanship of the Assembly, of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] for the next 12 months. In that capacity, it became my privilege to address in Paris the recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. Just before that Conference, I also had the privilege of formally inaugurating the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, which was held at Nairobi in August. Today, on the heels of such important commitments and endeavors, I have the truly great honor of submitting, on behalf of Africa, a statement to the General Assembly the highest representative body responsible for the management of all matters affecting the international community.\n3.\tMr. President, on behalf of the independent nations of Africa, which comprise one third of the whole membership of the United Nations, I bring, and convey to you, to the representatives attending this session of the Assembly and to the SecretaryGeneral warm greetings and good wishes for your deliberations.\n4.\tAllow me, while doing so, to observe as well that the OAU has been unwavering in its support for and loyal adherence to the ideals of the United Nations and its practical efforts to progress towards them. Our continental institution is inspired by the same high principles in the conduct of human affairs and shares with the United Nations the conviction that the noblest causes, of development and human destiny must be founded upon the bastion of peace.\n5.\tMr. President, before I proceed any further I would like to congratulate you on behalf of Africa and on behalf of my country, Kenya, on your election to the high position of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The work of the current session of the Assembly covers matters of great importance. In addition, many of those matters are of extreme urgency. The international community is therefore most fortunate in having a man of such experience, talent and commitment to the promotion of truly international solutions to global matters presiding over the current session of the Assembly. I assure you, Sir, of the fullest support of the African nations. May I also add that I look forward to working with you as 1 carry out my responsibilities as Chairman of the OAU Assembly this year.\n6.\tOn this occasion I should like to pay a tribute to the work of the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar. Mr. von Wechmar carried out his responsibilities with great skill, competence and understanding. I know I am speaking for all nations when I thank Mr. von Wechmar for having worked so hard and conscientiously to promote international cooperation and understanding.\n7.\tI should like on this occasion to pay a tribute to the tremendous commitment to the general welfare and future of mankind of the Secretary-General. Mr. Waldheim continues to display an amazing amount of energy and dedication in his job. I know that we in Africa have always found him sympathetic, knowledgeable and quick to listen and take action. We also appreciate the fact that he frequently visits various parts of the world to see at first hand the problems and opportunities facing the regions individually and the international community in general. Mr. Waldheim is now one man who knows all the leaders in all parts of the world, and he has used that knowledge and his well-known diplomatic skills to great advantage in his service to the international community.\n8.\tTUrning now to this session of the General Assembly, let me observe that these annual gatherings should never be regarded as routine features or performances of global administration. There must always be fresh vigor on such a great occasion to introduce new ideas, to enhance the effectiveness of programs earlier established and to bring within reach some potential which hitherto had proved elusive. At this particular session the Assembly will discuss many matters of great importance, some of which I shall refer to later in my speech. I know that under your guidance, Mr. President, concrete progress on many of those matters will be made.\n9.\tX\tI shall begin the main portion of my statement with a review of the tense situation and the circumstances now prevailing in southern Africa. The situation in that unhappy part of the world constitutes a critical test for the whole conception of an organized and stable international\nA/36/PV. \ncommunity operating on the basis of democratic principles. It is a critical test because achievement of that objective, which must forever remain the overall objective, is jeopardized whenever democracy and human rights are threatened, ignored or deliberately undermined in any part\nof the world.\n10.\tWe are not dealing, in this context, with a vexatious administrative detail, but with principles which bear vitally upon human prospects on this overcrowded planet. To shape the evolving destiny of mankind demands as one of the fundamentals the removal of any constraints whether physical, social or psychological placed upon the free association and contribution of all members of the human race. There is a corresponding need for the enlightened exercise by all Governments of their responsibility to interpret rather than to distort the feelings of and potential for affinity which are latent throughout human populations.\n11.\tSince the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, in its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, a tremendous contribution has been recorded by the United Nations in work designed to secure the political independence of territories once held in colonial or racist bondage. This global Organization, unique in its nature and experience, has grown to maturity upon the rock of human dignity in freedom. It is recognized as well, reaching back to the first essential purpose of the United Nations, that global peace must be imperiled by any forfeiture of human rights.\n12.\tIn dealing with a succession of problems in this whole regard, Africa has been relying to a certain extent on the tangible and worldwide support of the United. Nations. It is, of course, perfectly rational that such confidence should be placed in the United Nations, if only because the Organization was designed to represent, to assist and to inspire the concerted striving of mankind for freedom and wellbeing. We are all glad that in the majority of cases the United Nations, operating within its own Charter, has effectively discharged its responsibilities.\n13.\tUnfortunately, in a few cases the objectives and the efforts of this international body have been frustrated by some nations. One of these cases is Namibia. I am sure that in respect to Namibia representatives will not need the prompting of any catalog of historical facts. It will be readily recalled that over a period of years many resolutions have been adopted, conferences \\\"have been convened, structures have been created, all in the cause of pursuing the mandated task of ushering that Territory by peaceful means towards the elementary right to self-determination.\n14.\tYet today, despite all the decisions and the patient efforts, Namibia is still not independent. It is not hard to discern within the historical records basic reasons for this failure, but analysis of the past seems to me of far less importance than reappraisal of the future. In my submission the General Assembly must consider most earnestly and urgently whether this is a circumstance requiring the enforcement, at whatever cost, of international law and paramount principles, or whether the United Nations can safely continue to accommodate the burden of weakness and the stigma of futility. This is of course a rhetorical question. The General Assembly has no alternative but to undertake whatever steps are necessary to bring independence to Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\n15.\tIn the broadest context of the tense situation how prevailing in southern Africa,, the main obstacle to progress has been the militancy encouraged and nurtured from outside the Republic of South Africa itself. In confronting all these threats and outrages that have so far been manifested, the sincerity of the United Nations has never been brought into question, but its efforts and objectives have constantly been undermined by hypocrisy and subterfuge which continue to prevent any tangible progress in the establishment of human rights for all in that part of the world. And so, during this session of the General Assembly, we must all clarify our minds with regard to our purpose and the hindrances before us as far as the situation in southern Africa is concerned.\n16.\tThe system of apartheid has been rightly condemned by all those, including the vast majority in South Africa, who want peace for themselves and others and who recognize that human rights for all and in every part of the globe are an essential element in securing that peace. However, after decades of condemnation and protest, we are still faced in South Africa by the evil and inhuman system of apartheid, which embraces the total denial of political rights and of human outlet of expression. At times, on occasions of this nature, dictionaries have been consulted to find words which might convey something stronger than mere abhorrence. But the Assembly is not a theater, and so, rather than elaborate, I prefer to reduce this issue to its basic simplicities.\n17.\tAcross the whole spectrum of impact and meaning, apartheid torments the conscience of all civilized men. It violates those universal principles of human dignity and conduct which the United Nations has been authorized to codify and to harness. And there is no doubt that it affronts the very foundation of international law. On these three grounds alone, and there are many more, the only conclusion to be reached is that apartheid must be destroyed. In any case, there should never be any compromise with evil and apartheid is, in every aspect, evil.\n18.\tThe word \\\"destroyed\\\" can often seem to have some particular implication. Permit me, therefore, to make it clear at this point that nobody is anxious for Africa's clear duty in this matter, or, indeed, for global obligations in this matter, to be approached and discharged by violent means. We do not advocate violence. Our quarrel is with the system of apartheid, not with the people who live in South Africa. Further, we are of the view that the system should be changed peacefully. But when all such methods have failed, and logic has failed, what alternative is left? The significance of that question is that in some cases, as history shows, violence may have to be undertaken as a last resort.\n19.\tI should like to assure you that in this whole context, the OAU has examined all possible alternatives. In fact, resolutions passed during the thirty-seventh ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held at Nairobi in June 1981, have been circulated to all States Members of the United Nations [see A/36/534, annex I] for endorsement or adoption if deemed appropriate by the General Assembly. These cover a diversity of tactics and topics. For example, there was condemnation by the OAU of acts of blatant aggression by South Africa against the neighboring African States. Apart from representing an outrage in terms of the Charter of the United Nations, the consequences of such acts have ranged widely into fields of economic and social disruption. It is my own view that all members of the United Nations family should now regard and declare themselves as \\\"front-line States\\\" in confrontation with South Africa, making it known that aggression against one will henceforth be resisted by all.\n20.\tAlready, some of the countries around South Africa have reported to the General Assembly and the Security Council acts of aggression against them by South African forces. To give a recent example, there has been an invasion and occupation of Angola by South African military forces. This clearly constitutes a most dangerous threat to international peace and security. The OAU demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African forces from Angola. We are confident that the Assembly has no alternative but to support that demand, for not to do so would betray the very principles for which the United Nations stands.\n21.\tThen, as another instance, we have reaffirmed what the OAU previously had insisted that one of the effective weapons for dealing with the situation in South Africa is the complete isolation of that country. The effectiveness of that weapon is blunted every time commercial ties and sporting links with that country are established, maintained or strengthened. And this is why we regret so deeply the concessions recently made by certain States which have accepted the continuation of sporting links with South Africa. We in Africa have an increasingly impressive record of contribution and achievement under many headings of sport and athletics. Indeed, we find no enjoyment or relish whatsoever if sport anywhere in .the world is disrupted. But we cannot stand idly by without protest or countermeasures while some countries encourage South Africa through sporting links to continue with its defiance of world opinion and accepted standards of human behavior.\n22.\tEven more damaging, albeit less widely publicized, is the economic support by some nations of the South African regime. In this regard, I must call attention to the resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers of the OAU [ibid., resolution CM/Res. 865 (XXXVII)] on sanctions against South Africa, including a global ban on the supply of oil to that country.\n23.\tWe are all well aware that in the past a majority resolve indeed, an overwhelming resolve to take such punitive economic action against South Africa was blocked, finally and technically, by veto in the Security Council. Here again I would submit that the General Assembly must urgently concern itself with those procedures and motivations which permit the system of veto to continue to be deployed as a protective shield around any State which poses a threat to world peace. Let there be no doubt that the South Africa situation constitutes, directly and indirectly, a serious threat to world peace and stability.\n24.\tMuch of this whole question of South Africa concerns the exercise of responsibility to the paramount interests of mankind by those Member States Commonly referred to as the big Powers, and here I refer to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. Africa will forever be grateful if they leave us to develop and help us economically, rather than take us simply because we are weak and unable to defend ourselves in terms of weaponry.\n25.\tAll of us in this Assembly Hall are members of the human race, whether we be white, black or what have you. God created us all. And those whom we represent would like to have peace, and only peace can enable them to prosper. We understand the language. For me, should anyone act to undermine human dignity, even if he be a friend, I shall tell him straight: you have made a mistake. This planet is too small for us to quarrel. We should work for the common good. Those who have had the advantage of advancing in their technology should help those of us who have not. One day we may be able to advance. We may offer our own contribution in the humblest way, but not in terms of what the superPowers can offer.\n26.\tWhile the United States and the Soviet Union meet peacefully in a room to discuss global matters, people outside, especially in Africa, quarrel, fight and shoot each other, while others flee as refugees in their own countries instead of enjoying stability. I hope that people will see reason and be able to discuss human problems as they are, and I appeal to the two superPowers to help the world maintain peace. We may not have powerful weapons, but at least as far as God is concerned we are all equal. All of us here, and those to come, will have to depart, but we should leave the world better than we found it. All the superPowers have solemnly affirmed their loyal adherence to the principles and obligations of the Charter. One would then expect that the demands of integrity would cause them to subordinate narrow self-interest so that the objectives set for ail humanity could be achieved.\n27.\tI frequently find it impossible to comprehend where the big Powers stand on this matter of South Africa. There have been promises to \\\"exert pressure\\\" as a means of securing some solution, but all such assurances have proved to be empty of meaning. The big Powers have in fact positively declined to exert, or even to support, the kind of influence which, emanating from such sources, could not fail to have an instant impact. They have said to us that we should never think or plan in terms of military force or in terms of economic sanctions or even in terms of psychological pressure. Instead, they still exhort us after all this time to fall back upon the comfortable and unproductive cushions which suit them so well of moderation, tolerance and patience. I can only urge, with due respect for sensitivities within this body, that this hypocritical approach be brought to an immediate end. Further, it is abundantly clear that unless that is done relations between nations will rapidly grow sour, with immense dangers to all, at a time when all those who want peace and stability should be working even more closely together.\n28.\tI repeat that Africa believes that there is a moral duty devolving upon all peoples and all nations to defend and sustain above all else the fundamentals of human dignity and human rights, for these are the prerequisites for any worthwhile evolution and destiny of mankind. Those who deny that such a duty exists should at least have the courage to make their viewpoint plain, so that we would know where sanity is enshrined and where evil is befriended. We in Africa are determined to destroy by whatever means the last vestiges of segregation and discrimination within our continent. This is the basic aim of the United Nations, and unless it is upheld steadfastly and without modification the United Nations will become a mockery of the faith, hope and treasure invested in it by\nmankind. \n29.\tI should now like to refer briefly to a few other issues which reflect upon political events in Africa. In some of these instances there is a welcome glimpse of progress and promise. Then in respect of all of them, I would make the point that negotiations and ultimate settlement should be left to the leaders and people of Africa. I say this because in the past many problems have been made more complex or more intractable by external intervention. This has often been part of the ideological power game, but even well-meaning interference has often proved clumsy in its impact.\n30.\tTo begin with, I would mention a recent disagreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the United Republic of Cameroon which might very possibly have escalated into a serious collision between these two neighboring States of Africa. Today, happily, the danger has passed, and I am left only with the pleasant duty of commending the two Presidents concerned for their adroit handling of the situation and for agreeing that the border dispute between their two countries should be solved in a brotherly atmosphere.\n31.\tThe second issue concerns the difficulties in West em Sahara, which have been persisting for some time, but I am glad now to inform the General Assembly that during the most recent session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU the way was finally cleared for the holding of a referendum by means of which the people of that Territory will determine their own future. An Implementation Committee was established by the OAU for the task [ibid., annex II, resolution AHG/ Res. 103 (XVIII)], and I am again glad to report that it held a very successful meeting at Nairobi towards the end of August. This Committee will work alongside the United Nations in ensuring that referendum procedures are so designed and supervised as to encompass, without challenge, the popular will.\n32.\tThen there is the case of Chad. Here also a number of concrete steps have .been taken to reestablish peace and good order [ibid., resolution AHG/Res.102 (XVIII)/ Rev.l]. Within this framework, the OAU has declared its support for the Transitional National Union Government while at the same time reaffirming unqualified opposition to any aggressive intrigue from outside. It also recognized the urgent need to assist the Government and people of Chad in their programs of economic reconstruction.\n33.\tThe Horn of Africa is a region in which genuine economic cooperation could hold out immense promise for human development. It is most regrettable therefore that, over some period of time now, this potential has been frustrated by the unceasing encroachment of cold war politics and ideological divisions. More recently, however, there have been some heartening signs of new awareness about the common interests and opportunities which should constructively link the various nations and people in the Horn of Africa,\n34.\tAgainst that background, I am saddened that dispute and conflict still persist between Ethiopia and Somalia. The report of the Good Offices Committee which had been established by the OAU1 was received and endorsed at the Nairobi summit meeting [ibid., annex II, decision], and all of us are now fervently hoping for an era of peace. This would not be hard to introduce and to sustain if both sides would formally recognize and apply the fundamental OAU principle in regard to the sovereignty of independent States, respect for boundaries as existing at the time of independence and noninterference in the internal affairs of other States.\n35.\tFinally, regarding specific issues relating to Africa, I should include mention of the refugee problem in the continent. This problem was examined sympathetically during the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa held at Geneva last April. There are now about 5 million refugees in Africa, driven away from their homelands by fear which has its roots in turmoil or oppression. But mere figures cannot adequately portray all the misery for innocent families and the colossal squandering of human resources.\n36.\tThis whole crisis it can hardly be described as anything less is the primary responsibility of African Governments and peoples themselves. Thus, working in conjunction with United Nations agencies and with nongovernmental organizations, including the African churches, we have embarked upon many programs for immediate aid and relief in the fields of food, clothing, shelter and medical care, while beginning as well to introduce education and training projects.\n37.\tIn all this compassionate work, we require and would appreciate additional assistance from the international community. In giving such support, the international community and individual donors should be assured that the OAU and its member countries recognize the urgent need to deal decisively and comprehensively with the ultimate challenge that of eradicating from the continent the diverse causes of the refugee problem.\n38.\tI should also like to record some disappointment, which must be shared by all representatives, in respect of issues which have for too long remained unresolved despite all the anxious efforts and dispassionate recommendations of this global body. I would submit yet again that the General Assembly might usefully examine the reasons, in certain particular cases, for the ineffectiveness of decisions taken and resolutions passed. It must be regarded as disturbing and a most serious matter whenever Member States fail to honor their obligations under the Charter. Difficulties are then compounded whenever Member States ignore or contravene provisions and principles of international law. Such considerations, however, are merely two components of the total dilemma which remains that of how to introduce and implement consensus in a more positive way while somehow keeping intact the vital concept of the sovereignty of nations.\n39.\tIn the Middle East, for example, it is clear that all States, including Israel, have the right to enjoy recognized and secure boundaries, within which they are entitled to defend and sustain their lawful interests and freely to conduct their internal affairs. But equally, the Palestinian people are entitled to speak for themselves and to pursue their just aspirations within a recognized national homeland. There can never be peace and stability in that area without a national homeland for Palestinian people. If there could only be mutual respect for the basic simplicity of these ideas, then, surely, it would not be beyond the reach of human genius to find some rapid accommodation, under which years of physical attrition and galvanic emotion could give way to a whole new era of creative human enterprise.\n40.\tAs I mentioned before, we all belong to the human race. We in Kenya stand on three principles: peace, love and unity. There can never be peace if people have no love for the human race. There can never be unity unless there is love for the human race. There can never be understanding and confidence created unless people have love for one another. We may pass 101 resolutions in the Assembly and not achieve anything if there is no love for one another. I hope that all of us will have respect for humanity if we are truly members of the human race.\n41.\tAnother example, also of primary concern to Africa, is the question of preserving the entire Indian Ocean area as a zone of peace. This has in fact been stipulated by the General Assembly [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] for the noble purpose of strengthening the foundations of human development over a large and productive segment of the third world. But it seems, in the event, that a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean is already, or potentially, being eroded by military adventuring and ideological rivalry among the big Powers. And I wonder, we in the OAU wonder, just what attitudes or measures might be formulated within the General Assembly in response to challenges of this kind wherein a yearning for peace as the fulcrum of progress by so many nations and peoples is threatened by a few nations.\n42.\tI wish now to turn to some matters bearing upon economic and social development within Africa, and at the outset I should thank most genuinely those nations which have lent support to development projects in Africa for motives which have added a whole new dimension to the concepts and the potentials of a growing global human fraternity. In other instances, of course, seemingly attractive aid programs have been dangled before Africa, but with a great deal of small print in all the qualifying clauses. There should really be widespread recognition nowadays that the hapless and vulnerable period when colonialism could be practiced has passed into history. Yet still there have been some persistent attempts to chain Africa as the periphery of the so-called donors and benefactors.\n43.\tThe African nations are aware of this danger of neocolonialism, and as a form of reaction to that wearisome impulse the OAU, as it acquires more sophisticated executive machinery and economic infrastructures, is now determined that Africa itself must play a new and principal part in the planning of development on a continental scale. Tn this connection, and following studies and negotiations throughout the 1970s, at an extraordinary session held at Lagos in April 1980, the Assembly, of Heads of State and Government adopted the Lagos Plan of Action,  which in turn was incorporated by the General Assembly into the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [resolution 35/56, annex].\n44.\t1 should like to say a little more about our fundamental thinking in regard to the economic evolution of Africa. Years ago, when many of the OAU member States were struggling to assert themselves and to establish themselves after the triumph of political independence, there was an assumption in many economic circles that in Africa underdevelopment was inevitable and could be overcome only through stronger bilateral economic links with the former metropolitan Powers, primarily through financial aid, technical assistance and foreign investment. We do not believe that underdevelopment is inevitable. Moreover, we know that new strategies of development, based upon collective self-reliance and the immense overall resources of Africa, are needed. This means, among other things, that many of the old systems and patterns will have to be changed. For example, as we move further into this newly dawning era there can no longer be an almost total reliance by Africa upon the export of raw materials, coupled with an almost total dependence on external sources for capital goods and manufactured products.\n45.\tTo bring about a number of such fundamental changes, we are rapidly engineering far-reaching measures of economic and technical cooperation among ourselves. This strategy of collective self-reliance will result in more effective deployment of resources, the expansion of existing enterprises, the better use of managerial skills and the full harnessing of human and material ingredients for rapid and diversified development in general.\n46.\tI am not suggesting that Africa does not need financial and technical support from outside or that Africa is going to isolate itself from the rest of the world. But it is clear that past strategies, with their great dependence on foreign aid and export of primary commodities, have failed to produce real development in Africa. For example, the aid given is often more than offset by lower export prices and higher prices for Africa's imports.\n47.\tIn addition, the dangers of neocolonialism are visible. It is basically for these reasons that the most effective way in which the international community could help Africa in its development of collective self-reliance would be to agree on the early establishment of a more favorable and just international environment in terms of peace and stability and in terms of economic justice. This is essentially what the new international economic order is all about. And that new order would be in the best interests of all, the developed and the developing, the rich and the poor, the small and the big.\n48.\tIt is within that kind of international environment that efforts in such things as financial aid and technical assistance take on real meaning, lit is also within that kind of framework that they will be what aid efforts should be, namely, international programs for international development for all. I am sometimes asked to identify a few of the priority areas within which such international programs for genuine cooperative development might make the most profound impact. In response to this, especially in the short term, there is no difficulty in singling out the precarious food situation.\n49.\tThe African States recognize the food crisis facing them and the fact that their own survival and political independence are at stake. They also recognize the need for comprehensive solutions to the problems and the vital requirement of collective self-reliance as the foundation of such solutions. The international community can help Africa to overcome this serious crisis by supporting the measures and policies designed by Africa itself. Indeed, considering the huge and untapped natural resources of Africa, including climate, for diversified agricultural development, the aim should be to assist Africa to become a substantial exporter of food to the rest of the world. Africa now exports coffee, tea, cocoa and a range of horticultural items. There is no reason why the continent should not also become a vast source of meat and grain for the rest of the world. programs designed to promote this objective would clearly benefit both industrial and developing countries. They would truly be international programs for international development.\n50.\tThe other area is manufacturing. In terms of industrialization, Africa is the least developed of all regions. Although some of the OAU member States have an industrial sector that is far from negligible in size and diversity, over the African scene as a whole there is boundless scope and need for expansion. Here again, therefore, is an important and worthwhile field of human effort within which there could be rapid and effective response to international investment. I should like to be able to discern, in practice, firm global support for an industrial development decade throughout Africa, with its provisions and locations and end products all sensibly mapped out. The OAU would be greatly heartened if real progress along such lines could be made prior to the Fourth General Conference of UNIDO, to be held at Nairobi in 1983. Here again, such a program would have clear international benefits.\n51.\tAs a third and final answer to the question posed, I would identify as another urgent necessity the development of transport services and facilities and the improvement of all kinds of communications throughout Africa. This is yet another field in which global and bilateral initiatives would be most welcome. It is easy enough to head towards Africa or consign goods to Africa from anywhere in the world, but within the large continent of Africa the lack of well-maintained internal routes and modern communications has served as a constant frustration. This situation must be swept aside so that trade within Africa can be made to flourish, so that areas which are at present untapped may be developed and so that what I have described as collective self-reliance can have at its command the nuts and bolts, the working parts, that will enable it to function. I therefore take this opportunity to call upon the international community to support the programs already designed within the strategy of the transport and communications decade in Africa.\n52.\tWhat may loosely be termed the global or international economy is really structured upon a series of longstanding assumptions and arrangements, which so frequently serve either to overlook or to distort the facts of life. 1 should now like to discuss this situation briefly.\n53.\tThinking back 20 years or more, all of us can remember the so-called wind of change which, within a concentrated period of history, made a tremendous impact upon the political shape of human values and relationships. Wrapped up in so much transformation, we find the origin of expressions like \\\"developing countries\\\" and \\\"third world\\\", which today have become part of our commonplace vocabulary. During the 1950s and 1960s the revolution in political approaches and ideas was in some cases freely manifested and in other cases hastened or enforced by struggle. But, one way or another, everything occurred and then fairly rapidly moved into a phase of easy acceptance or even welcome. Despite many obvious frailties and uncertainties, the global prospect then appeared encouraging and hopeful. The world was moving forward, with new teams \\\"of players and what appeared to be the promise of a new set of rules. The only thing lacking tragically lacking was the vision to appreciate that without an equally dramatic change in economic relationships the new game must become chaotic because the field of play itself would be progressively destroyed.\n54.\tThere has been no sharing, no spread, no move towards regional balance. As the economic system has evolved since 1960, the majority of developing countries has continued to be regarded as sources of cheap raw materials and as markets for manufactured products. That has not only perpetuated indeed, worsened problems that were clearly inherent at the time of independence, but has also made the developing countries increasingly vulnerable to the economic trends and pressures which have come to have serious effects upon advanced and industrialized nations.\n55.\tAs years went by, the analysis of global realities became more accurate, more sophisticated and always more ominous. On the strength of such analysis efforts to secure redress became more urgent and persistent. There was much basic wisdom in the designs underlying the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade, which was launched by the General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. It was hoped that under that broad heading world economic relations could be sensibly restructured, but the outcome, in practice, was negligible. Then came debates and negotiations for a new international economic order, to which 1 referred earlier. But endeavors to reach and to activate that hardheaded and practical ideal, efforts made by the entire international community and by many specialized assemblies, have resulted so far in failure. Consequently every bright human prospect continues to be thwarted, at this very hour, by disorder and disparity.\n56.\tThere is sometimes said to be a lack of political will among the advanced and industrial nations to support the development of the poor countries. What seems to me even more extraordinary is an evident lack of perception: the blinkers that are worn against the gleam of simple common sense. No one can really believe that the systems, attitudes and provisions combined in some new international economic order could represent some plot hatched by the weak to undermine the strong. A new order would so obviously be for the benefit of all.\n57.\tWe occupy a planet on which all nations and human communities are now completely interdependent. And the whole existing system, apart from being clearly inequitable, is also extremely inefficient in practical terms. How can there be benefit, either for the advanced or for the developing countries, when there is such a high rate of inflation and such vast idle capacity of plants and manpower in the North? How can there be benefit for the advanced and developed countries when there are such huge untapped and idle natural and human resources in the South? How can benefit be drawn from wasteful use of resources? How can there be benefit when the industrial nations lean towards greater protectionism for themselves while at the same time insisting, often through multilateral organizations like IMF, on greater liberalization of trade on the part of the disadvantaged? How can there be benefit when, through the lack of global economic sense and through the lack of any purposeful coordination, major human problems are never realistically observed? How can any country or community benefit when the consequences of existing economic patterns make a mockery of all our hopes and prayers for peace?\n58.\tThe meeting last month in Mexico of the foreign ministers of 22 States will be followed by a summit meeting next month at Cancun, which is projected as a dialog between the advanced and the less developed countries. The task of that meeting, as it has been described, will be to reach some understanding on key negotiating issues, which may then be debated and translated into effective processes by the General Assembly. Never will the work of this world forum have enshrined a more critical responsibility.\n59.\tI should like to conclude this part of my statement on a rather whimsical note relating to the coming dialog. For decades there has been constant affirmation of the fact which is perfectly true that the South could never: advance and prosper, as we would all like it to do, without the North. But when all considerations and criteria are taken into account, there is another side to this coin as well: the North could not even survive without the South.\n60.\tI am told that there are animals called lemmings, which periodically gather in some great concourse and hurtle towards mass destruction by casting themselves from cliffs into the sea. There are moments when I wonder whether the human* race is any more intelligent or can hope for any more exalted outcome. As I have said, we occupy a small and, in many ways, fragile planet, with a narrow biosphere made functional by rather delicate balances and cycles which alone can support human life. And on this planet we proceed to behave, metaphorically speaking, just like the lemmings. Oxygen is vital to us, yet we constantly deplete the phenomena and systems which govern water-flow, while silting or polluting lakes and rivers. Soil is vital to us, yet each year huge quantities of topsoil, which cannot be replaced in the foreseeable future, are lost through practices giving rise to its erosion. Plant cover is vital to us, yet we destroy it and create spreading deserts. All the processes of natural growth and decay are vital to us, yet we inhibit them through the liberal use of toxic chemicals. Wildlife is essential to us, inasmuch as without ecological diversity there can be no full enjoyment of life, yet we set out to destroy or thrust aside all other living creatures.\n61.\tMankind has gone on blindly decimating and disrupting the natural environment, thereby compounding an overriding human peril which is often obscured beneath the more popular obsession with economic failures and shortcomings. If we are not to be like lemmings, there will have to be a further revolution in the scope of human intellect and in the sense of values commanded and exerted by the human mind.\n62.\tLeadership today must not be narrow-minded. Domestic success or contentment must henceforth be meaningless unless they lie within the matrix of universal advancement and contentment. The absolute interdependence of all human communities, once deemed to be impractical or even undesirable, is now a reality which can never be set aside. And so perspective is transformed, and the world as a whole, through its local leadership in power and through investing the United Nations with more authority and vitality, must move away from little squares and corners onto the sweep of the whole vast human canvas.\n63.\tThere have been some signs heartening signs that leaders of the international community have recognized sporadic warning lights of crisis, of such a nature and scale as to demand countermeasures having the effective impetus of world administration. This fact broadly underlies the recent examination, organized by the United. Nations, of environmental questions, food prospects, employment, water resources, the problem of desertification, human settlements and renewable sources of energy. But these approaches have been cautious. Judgments have not been unanimous. Co ordination has been lacking. Implementation has been most disappointing. And we are running out of time.\n64.\tAll world spokesmen henceforth must be molded in common awareness that leadership is not only an immense responsibility, but also a new kind of responsibility not to an electorate or a party machine or an ideological purpose, but to the service of mankind. For on this planet, already brought close to catastrophe by the undisciplined pillage of resources and the futilities of economic injustice, only from this concept of dedication to mankind might there be snatched, before it is too late, some luster with which human destiny could finally become adorned.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should first like to extend to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the important office of President of the General Assembly. Your long experience in the United Nations and your wisdom guarantee the success of your high mission. My delegation wants to assure you of its full cooperation in achieving that objective.\n121.\tI also want to offer my thanks and congratulations to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, the outgoing President, who, during the year that has just elapsed, so admirably guided both a regular and a special session with very heavy agendas.\n122.\tMy delegation also wants to address its thanks to the Secretary General for his persevering efforts aimed at reaffirming the noble principles of our Charter. His eminent contribution made it possible to convene the International Conference on Kampuchea last July.\n123.\tIt is with great satisfaction that my delegation cordially welcomes Vanuatu and Belize, which have just joined the United Nations. We are convinced that those two new Member States will make an active contribution to the realization of the ideals and objectives of the Charter.\n124.\tThe international situation continues to be marked by accrued tensions. The older hotbeds of tension such as\nNamibia and the Middle East have been aggravated, and others have appeared in the meantime.\n125.\tIn Kampuchea, my own country, and in Afghanistan the struggle against invasion and foreign occupation is gaining in intensity. In Asia, in Africa, in Europe and in Latin America, the peoples are continuing their just struggle to acquire and preserve their independence and their freedom to live in honor and national dignity.\n126.\tEven though we must face an aggression of a most barbaric kind, the people and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea are paying continuous attention to the great problems of the world, and we wish to reiterate our support for the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. Its 10 point program for reunification, presented by its President, Kim II Sung, at the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, is in keeping not only with the deep aspirations of the Korean people but also with the interests of peace. We support the heroic struggle of the Afghan people against the Soviet invasion to regain its independence and the right to choose its Government and its political, economic and social regime and to restore the Islamic and nonaligned character of Afghanistan. We continue to give our support to the struggle of the Arab and Palestinian peoples to recover the territories that have been occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem. We maintain that the Palestinian people must be able freely to exercise its fundamental national rights, including its right to return to its homeland, its right to self-determination and its right to establish a Palestinian State. All the countries of the Middle East must have the right to existence and independence. Concerning southern Africa, we would renew our support for the rapid achievement of independence by Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978), and we wish to reiterate our support for the struggle of the Azanian people against the colonialist and racist apartheid regime of South Africa.\n127.\tThe causes of the increasing deterioration of the international situation are many and complex, but the dominating cause continues to be the aggressive actions of global and regional expansionists in every part of the world.\n128.\tSince the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan, one year apart, in similar conditions and under identical pretexts, an undeniable fact has become evident to the international community in all its acuteness, cruelty and scope: the emergence of a new kind of imperialism, an international expansionism of a global and regional character, which now constitutes the greatest danger to the independence of peoples and the peace and security of the world.\n129.\tThis new force of domination and enslavement speaks of anti-imperialist struggle but acts as an expansionist and hegemonist. It speaks of support for the national liberation struggle and proclaims that nothing is more important than independence, but in fact is cynically destroying the independence that has recently and heroically been acquired by peoples and nations. That force constantly speaks of respect for national' sovereignty and of the territorial integrity of countries but at the same time cruelly invades neighboring countries, using as a pretext \\\"internationalist solidarity\\\", \\\"special friendship\\\" or \\\"fraternal aid\\\". Rarely in the history of the world has the gap separating words and deeds and proclaimed ideals and macabre realities been so great. Never in the annals of international crime against independence and the freedom of peoples has demagogy been used in such a cynical fashion to serve a strategy of regional and world domination.\n130.\tThis awareness of the international community has been expressed in a firm and coordinated will to oppose the increasing danger of expansionism. International pressure on the invaders has increased to make them withdraw their forces from Kampuchea and Afghanistan and allow the peoples of those countries freely to exercise their inalienable right to decide upon their future destinies themselves.\n131.\tThis increased awareness on the part of the international community of the growing danger of expansionism and the support that results from that awareness constitutes valuable encouragement for the people and Government of Democratic Kampuchea in their struggle for the survival of the Kampuchean nation. In the field, the struggle is continuing and increasing. The Vietnamese enemy, despite its numerical and material superiority, has suffered considerable losses. The so-called \\\"Khmeriza tion\\\" of the war undertaken by the enemy has failed. The troops in the field are only Vietnamese troops, and the result is that the Vietnamese enemy has now lost the initiative on all fronts. It has been reduced to being increasingly on the defensive. It is no longer in a position to eliminate Democratic Kampuchea through the force of arms.\n132.\tThose successes of Democratic Kampuchea in the military sphere could not have been achieved without the active participation of the population in \u2022 the war for national survival. Without the effective contribution of all the people, who nourish, guide, cover, inform, and help the struggle logistically and otherwise, and send to it their sons and daughters, it would be inconceivable for the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, which is numerically inferior and poorly equipped, to bring to a complete halt an invading army of 250,000 men well equipped and experienced in warfare.\n133.\tThat active participation of the population in the resistance side by side with the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea is a clear denial of the lies and allegations of the Vietnamese according to which the Government of Democratic Kampuchea receives no support from the population. It also snows the correctness of the new strategic political line laid down by the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and of the political program of the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea, line and program that all the cadres of the Government, the Front and the army are now committed to apply with the assistance and full support of the population, so that they will become a living reality for all.\n134.\tThanks to the continuous enlargement of the zones under the control of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the resultant reinforcement of security, as they have been liberated the villages have been organized administratively and politically on the basis of the fundamental democratic freedoms outlined in the political program of the Front. The road oT full recovery from the ashes of the war of racial extermination being relentlessly waged by the enemy on Kampuchean soil stretches far ahead but, in the villages that have already been liberated, everyday activities have resumed. Education, culture and handicrafts have come to life again.\n135.\tSince they cannot impose their law on Kampuchea, the Vietnamese invaders have stepped up their cruelty, and they are intensifying the war of extermination against the people of Kampuchea. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of our fellow countrymen have perished, victims of conventional and chemical armaments and the systematic use of the weapon of starvation by the invaders.\n136.\tIn their raids, the Vietnamese aggressors continue to use the tactics of the \\\"scorche dearth\\\" policy, killing, destroying everything in their path. In the zones under their temporary control, the population has been placed in \\\"strategic hamlets\\\", making it impossible for them even to go to look for some wild fruit or wild plants with which to fill their empty stomachs. They steal the harvests from the peasants and continue to divert the international assistance to feed their own forces. They systematically create starvation and they use it as a genocidal weapon to eliminate all who oppose their law. Thus they hope to put an end to any national resistance at its very source.\n137.\tThe expansionists of Hanoi have also intensified the use of chemical weapons. They have even the impudence to use them now in localities which are situated very close to the towns and to the borders of Thailand. Two weeks ago, on 14 September, the Vietnamese troops fired toxic gas shells at the village of Takong, which is about 10 kilometers from Sisophon in the province of Battambang. They killed or seriously poisoned 55 persons. All of those odious crimes are now known to the international community and they have aroused the indignation and condemnation of all. The symptoms of toxicity described in the note verbal dated 14 September 19S1 from the Permanent Representative of the United States [A/36/509] are entirely in keeping with the description which was given by the Ministry of Public Health of Democratic Kampuchea on 10 April 1981 [AI36/254].\n138.\tThe suffering of our people is beyond description, for it is boundless. It is as great as the unholy determination of the Hanoi expansionists to integrate Kampuchea at all costs, even without the population, within the Vietnamese empire, which would be called the \\\"Indochina Federation\\\" and would also include Laos.\n139.\tSince there was no victory and no blitzkrieg which could produce the rapid and total destruction of the leadership of Democratic Kampuchea, the expansionists of Hanoi are now confronted with a situation in which they can no longer win a military victory. In pursuing their fundamental objective, which is the liquidation of Democratic Kampuchea, the Hanoi expansionists are now actively attacking the legal, status of the State of Democratic Kampuchea and trying to eliminate its leadership from the international scene, hoping that its military liquidation will follow. Even before their invasion of 25 December 1978, they unsuccessfully made a number of attempts at assassination, coup d'etat and destabilization in order to eliminate that leadership, because they know that it is profoundly patriotic and is determined at all costs to preserve the existence of Kampuchea as an independent nation, and for this reason it is firmly opposed to all maneuvers designed to absorb Democratic Kampuchea into the so called \\\"Indochina Federation\\\". Today, faced with the stalemate in their invasion, they resort to various stagings and maneuvers in the hope of achieving by diplomatic means the objective they have pursued for so long. They believe that if they can achieve this, bargaining will follow and allow them in one way or another to preserve the fruits of their invasion of Kampuchea and the pursuit of their strategy of expansion in SouthEast Asia.\n140.\tIn order to achieve this they multiply their campaigns of slander against Democratic Kampuchea and try to impose on the international community the Vietnamese administration in Phnom Penh, which is the result of their invasion, invoking the travesty of \\\"elections\\\" and a \\\"constitution\\\" which have not deceived anyone but themselves. In this connection, the International Conference on Kampuchea has clearly shown that as long as foreign forces have not been withdrawn from Kampuchea it is impossible for the Kampuchean people to express their will in free elections.\n141.\tThus, no matter how the Hanoi expansionists try, they will never be able to change the nature of the administration they have installed in Phnom Penh, and which is in fact only a shadow of the occupation forces, and as such will disappear the moment all those forces are withdrawn from Kampuchea. The people of Kampuchea know only too well the puppets that Hanoi has installed in Phnom Penh with the aid of Vietnamese bayonets, after they had been fed and educated since 1954 within the overall framework of the implementation of the strategy of the \\\"Indochina Federation\\\".\n142.\tAs a corollary to these vain attempts to legitimatize the invasion of Kampuchea, the leaders of Hanoi are actively endeavouring to sow dissension within the ranks of the ASEAN countries and other countries which cherish peace and justice and which support the just struggle of the people of Kampuchea and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea. On the other hand, those leaders continue their worn-out maneuvers aimed at burying the problem of Kampuchea by means of a so-called regional conference, while at the same time they continue to brandish the so-called Chinese threat. They persist in this game of the thief calling \\\"stop thief' with a cynicism which is particularly odious because the game is designed to cover up the genocide which threatens the very existence of a nation and a people.\n143.\tIn conformity with their usual tactics, the Hanoi expansionists believe that they can this time also exhaust the patience of the Governments that cherish peace and justice which are not intimidated by their threats or deceived by their false allegations and promises. They believe that perhaps the international community will simply grow tired and finally accept their occupation of Kampuchea as a fait accompli and thus release them from the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea, which were intended to lead to a solution of the Kampuchean problem, based on the complete withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea and the restoration to the people of Kampuchea of its inalienable right to decide its own future.\n144.\tThe leaders of Hanoi pretend to hold a dialog and no# declare that they support the Kuala Lumpur Declaration,  published on 27 November 1971 at the conclusion of a meeting of ministers for foreign affairs of ASEAN nations, on the creation of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in SouthEast Asia, which they have always opposed energetically, especially at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held at Colombo in 1976. Who can still believe these very people who only yesterday felt that they were the advanced bastion of socialism in SouthEast Asia and who referred to the ASEAN countries as the \\\"lackeys of American imperialists\\\"? Who can believe these very people who impudently violated the 1954 Geneva agreements, the 1962 agreements on Laos, the solemn commitment made in 1967 to respect the frontiers and the territorial integrity of Kampuchea and the 1973 Paris agreements?\n145.\tThe slanders, deceits and maneuvers of the Hanoi expansionists certainly will not be able to divert the attention of the international community from the danger and the threat which they represent for the region and for the whole world because of the close concordance of their regional expansionist strategy to the global Soviet strategy of expansion.\n146.\tIf at present this danger and this threat have not yet been able to develop fully, it is because the struggle of the Kampuchean people under the leadership of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea is being continued resolutely and has driven the Vietnamese enemy into inextricable difficulties in Kampuchea, in its own country and at the international level. Thus, the struggle of the Kampuchean people is indeed a struggle for survival, but at the same time it is also a contribution to the preservation of peace, stability and security in that region and in the world. If this struggle should one day cease, there can be no doubt that the Vietnamese empire will be consolidated. It will be able to draw new breath and, its strength restored, it will again affirm its will to dominate and to expand, a policy it is trying to conceal today for circumstantial reasons. The balance of forces in the region and in the world will thus be altered in such a way that it will no longer be possible to prevent this empire, supported by the expansionist great Power, to extend its tentacles into other areas of SouthEast Asia which it covets.\n147.\tHowever, by intoning the same old chant in the vain hope of achieving by diplomatic means what they cannot achieve on the battlefield, the expansionists of Hanoi reveal their own weakness. They show that their field of maneuver has grown smaller. The truth they can no longer conceal is that their military adventure in Kampuchea is daily causing their human, financial and economic resources to be swallowed up in a bottomless pit. Viet Nam's problems on both the political and economic levels are well known throughout the world. Nothing can remedy them, not even massive Soviet aid, and this will continue so long as Hanoi persists in its expansionist and annexationist ambition in Kampuchea and SouthEast Asia.\n148.\tOur struggle is not at all a struggle for the victory of an ideology. It is a struggle for the very survival of our nation and our people. The historical task we are facing is an onerous one.\n149.\tIn order to wage such a difficult struggle, full of sacrifices against an enemy bent on exterminating us, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea have clearly stated their sincere wish that all national forces participate in the struggle and share the responsibility for it. Since the beginning of 1979, they have endeavored in every way to unify all these national forces, regardless of their past or their political affiliations or tendencies, so as to carry on the struggle in all forms against the common enemy.\n150.\tAnimated by a high sense of patriotism and by their sincere desire to achieve national union, and placing the interests of the survival of the Kampuchean nation above all else, they remain prepared to associate all national forces in the direction of the affairs of the State of Democratic Kampuchea, and they do so even though they represent the legal and legitimate Government of Kampuchea and constitute the only force which for three years has been leading effectively and with success the struggle of the Kampuchean people and its National Army in such a way that the Vietnamese invading forces are now hopelessly bagged down on the battlefield.\n151.\tIt is in this spirit that the Government of Democratic Kampuchea signed the Joint Statement published in Singapore on 4 September 1981, at the end of a tripartite meeting, which affirms the desire of the national parties signatories to the Statement \\\"to form a coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea with a view to continuing the struggle in all forms for the liberation of Cambodia from the Vietnamese aggressors\\\".. [A/36/498, annex.]\n152.\tThat future tripartite coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea will be the continuation of the present Government of Democratic Kampuchea and set up within the framework of the State of Democratic Kampuchea. It must have as its objective the increase of the forces combating the Vietnamese invaders, the strengthening in all forms of the close coordination of the military, political and diplomatic struggle, that has enabled us to achieve such success so far in every field, and, lastly, the mobilization to an even greater extent of international support and assistance for our just struggle.\n153.\tIt is evident that the Vietnamese enemy will continue to do all it can to frustrate this national union and that even after its establishment it will do all it can to destroy it. This is why the Government of Democratic Kampuchea neither accepts nor does anything that might weaken the present struggle or impede its development, or in any way open any kind of breach that might be advantageous to the Vietnamese maneuvers.\n154.\tWe call with all our hearts for the speedy establishment of a coalition government. The delegation of Democratic Kampuchea in the tripartite Ad Hoc Committee to study the principles and forms that will make the establishment of such a coalition government possible received appropriate instructions to exert every effort towards that end.\n155.\tThe task of the tripartite Ad Hoc Committee is a difficult one. It is indispensable that the Ad Hoc Committee be able to work in a serene atmosphere that will engender mutual understanding and lead to a rapid conclusion of its work.\n156.\tThe solid and lasting union of all national forces that we are continually pursuing is not only based on imperatives of the movement. It is the best guarantee for the survival and the very durability of Kampuchea as an independent and sovereign nation, preserving its age old culture and civilization.\n157.\tPlaced as they are by geography and history directly adjacent to such an ambitious, arrogant and aggressive neighbor as the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which has become the pawn of global expansionism in SouthEast Asia, the people of Kampuchea have no other path than that of sincere and loyal union among all the country's social strata, whatever their political loyalties or tendencies. Only such a union will make it possible, following the liberation of the national territory, to rebuild and defend the country and to prevent Kampuchea from experiencing in its turn the tragic fate of the 65,000 square kilometers of its territory situated in the fertile plain of the Mekong Delta and which was once the Kampuchean Krom, today absorbed by Viet Nam.\n158.\tIn pursuing this goal, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea will continue to adhere firmly and loyally to their present political programF5 and to their proposal of 30 June 1981 for a five point program, which states, inter alia, that:\n\\\"After the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea, a general and free election with direct and secret ballot will be held, without any coercion from any armed forces or other forces, and this, under the strict and full supervision of the United Nations.\n\\\"This election aims at choosing a National Assembly.\n\\\"This National Assembly will establish a Constitution which will define the political regime of Kampuchea, a parliamentary regime which will not construct socialism or communism.\n\\\"Kampuchea will remain independent, peaceful, neutral and nonaligned, and will not allow any foreign military base on its territory.\n\\\"This National Assembly will choose a national government.\n\\\"This government will set up a national army to defend the country.\\\" [See A/36/367, annex.]\n159.\tKampuchea will then have a liberal parliamentary regime respectful of the International Covenants on Human Rights, to which Democratic Kampuchea has adhered since 17 October 1980.\n160.\tMore than any other people, the people of Kampuchea desires nothing more than the immediate cessation of its sufferings, which were caused by a war of aggression and which have been endured for too long a time. If it must overcome still more difficulties, consent to additional sacrifices and persevere in the present struggle in the field, this is because those burdens have been imposed upon it. The use of brutal armed force has always been the constant and main recourse of Hanoi. Negotiations are for Hanoi nothing more than deceitful delaying tactics. Experience and the lessons of the past have shown that concessions to Hanoi's demands have never led to a change in its strategic objectives. On the contrary, they have only encouraged Hanoi in the pursuit of its expansionist designs. Only coordinated pressures.in the military, political, economic and diplomatic fields will bring Hanoi to reason.\n161.\tAs a corollary to the struggle on the battlefield, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea is actively seeking on the international level ways and means of ending as soon as possible the suffering of the Kampuchean people and satisfying its deep felt aspiration to live in peace, independence, honor and national dignity.\n162.\tThe sine qua non condition of any just and lasting settlement of the Kampuchean problem is the total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea, which will make it possible for the people of Kampuchea to exercise its inalienable right to choose its own destiny without any foreign interference, to reestablish the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea and thus to bring peace, security and stability to SouthEast Asia. These requirements are entirely in conformity with the provisions of General Assembly resolutions 34/22 and 35/6 and the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea.3\n163.\tTo attempt, as do the Hanoi expansionists and their supporters, to turn the problem of Kampuchea into a \\\"regional problem\\\" is a conjuring trick which deceives no one anymore. Nothing can conceal the fact that the problem of Kampuchea is a problem neither of decolonization nor of a territory under United Nations trusteeship, but rather a problem of Vietnamese aggression against a sovereign nonaligned State which is a Member of the United Nations, and that that aggression, as in the case of the aggression against Afghanistan, is an integral part of the expansionist, global strategy to achieve world domination. The International Conference on Kampuchea properly stressed the aggressive nature of the Hanoi expansionists as well as the international nature of the Kampuchean problem.\n164.\tWithin the context in which the global and regional expansionists continue to advance their pawns on the global chessboard and to give a one sided interpretation to \\\"detente\\\", a just solution of the problem of Kampuchea based on respect for its sovereignty and for the Charter of the United Nations would help to pave the way towards the solution of other outstanding international problems, such as the problem of Afghanistan. It would show at the same time that in the current contest between the aggressive forces of expansionism and the peace-loving forces nothing can triumph over the will of the peace loving forces when that will is clearly asserted. It would also help to avert the danger of a third world conflagration.\n165.\tMy delegation wishes to reiterate the deep gratitude of the people of Kampuchea and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea to the ASEAN countries for the\nhistoric part which they played in defending not only the independence and the survival of the people of Kampuchea but also the cause of peace and security in SouthEast Asia and in the world. In keeping with the framework of the Charter of the United Nations and responding to the deep and legitimate aspirations of our peoples, who wish to see SouthEast Asia become a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, this noble action on the part of the ASEAN countries thus acquires a high moral and political significance. Our people and our Government will show themselves worthy of their trust and their solidarity with us.\n166.\tMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to express once again our gratitude to the other countries which cherish peace and justice and which have not only given active support to the just national cause of Kampuchea but have also made intense efforts to bring about a just and lasting solution of the Kampuchean problem. Their warm solidarity will never be forgotten by our people.\n167.\tBefore concluding, may I reaffirm this year, the twentieth anniversary of the birth of the nonaligned movement, the fact that Democratic Kampuchea and its people remain faithful to the principles of nonalignment as well as to those of the Charter of the United Nations. Despite the vicissitudes which it has been forced to undergo .by the expansionists, who have sought to destroy its identity and hitch it to their wagon of world domination, especially since the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held at Havana in September 1979, the nonaligned movement has shown through the determined struggle of the vast majority of its members that it will survive its illustrious founding fathers and that the principles of nonalignment will continue to light the way for peoples that cherish independence, peace and progress. The solidarity reaffirmed recently by the nonaligned movement at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non Aligned Countries, held at New Delhi in February 1981, with the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan, the victims of wars of aggression and occupation, in their just struggle, reflect much credit on the participants and augur well for the future, despite the obstacles to be overcome.\n168.\tBy its present struggle against the Vietnamese expansionists, my country is making a contribution not only to the defense of the principles of the Charter but also to the cause of the nonaligned movement, of which it is one of the founding members.\n"

        "file_text": "225.\tI should like first of all to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Kittani, on behalf of the Government of Maldives and my delegation, on his election to the high office of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n226.\tWe see in him a man of distinction and remarkable experience attained through long association with and involvement in the work of the United Nations, and we see in him the representative of one of the leading and prominent members of the nonaligned movement and of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, with which the Maldives has fraternal and close relations.\n227.\tI should like to express at the same time my country's heartfelt gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar, who discharged the duties of his office in an outstanding manner.\n228.\tI also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his continued dedication to the cause of the United Nations and his commitment to international peace and stability.\nMy delegation wishes him well in carrying out his important task.\n229.\tIt gives me great pleasure to welcome, on behalf of my delegation, Vanuatu and Belize to membership in the Organization, thus marking a further step towards complete decolonization and the attainment of universality by the United Nations.\n230.\tThe world is again passing through a disturbing stage in which tension prevails and is deepening and attaining everywhere alarming proportions. At this time one could simply say that the daring trend of interference in the internal affairs of sovereign and independent countries and the irresponsible return to the arms race are the major causes of the deterioration in the international climate, while the world community is suffering from the longstanding ailments of mistrust, fear and deliberate injustice. A few years ago we were heartened by the spirit of, detente, by the development of a positive dialog between the superPowers, and by the trend of a general consensus that the disaster of another world war must be avoided. But now we see that, instead of consideration for mutual interest and respect for shared opinion, naked aggression has become fearfully frequent. The right of people to self-determination and freedom is being denied by those who continue to defy the cause of justice and human dignity.\n231.\tThe recent acts by South Africa against the people of Namibia and the neighboring independent African States, and the escalation of military action by Israel against the Palestinian people and the neighboring Arab countries, could be seen as symptoms of an added malignancy in the international atmosphere. The aggressors appear to be protected in the interests of the mighty and powerful. Similarly, we see foreign troops which intervened to change the course of events in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, and in many other places in Africa and Asia, stubbornly remaining in those countries despite repeated calls for the world community for them to withdraw and let the peoples of those countries determine their destinies.\n232.\tThen comes a round of the arms race in which the superPowers are engaged not only in developing new types of destructive weapons, but also in a dangerous effort to use outer space for their military advantages. For the world community, even the thought of a nuclear war, however limited it may sound, is a nightmare. We feel that serious and immediate efforts must be made to decrease the continually rising international tension, which is driving the promoters of the arms race to a devastating frenzy. There is no justification at all for the technologically developed Powers to enter into an arms production process in which enormous financial resources are deployed while the world economy and even the domestic economies of individual countries are suffering from the difficulties of the current economic crisis. Unless all these developments are presumed to be a game where the only players are the superPowers and the spectators are the rest of the human race, there is no meaning to this irrational and inhuman trend.\t! .\n233.\tThe international community has had enough bitter experiences in the past when the logic of supremacy, domination and colonization prevailed. We should like to believe that the world community, which includes the big and the small, the rich and the poor; is now mature enough to appreciate the dangers of war and the virtues of peace and peaceful coexistence. It is the responsibility of all nations to contribute to world peace and stability. The principles of peace, justice and equality are clearly prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations. It is our solemn duty to uphold those principles and to fulfil our commitments to the human race.\n234.\tMaldives continues to be guided by the policy of nonalignment and has always endeavored humbly to contribute its modest share in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations, which remains the most prominent forum for solving international issues and consolidating the efforts of the world community towards justice and equality. It is our firm belief that the capabilities of the United Nations to move effectively into the areas of its sacred mandate should be increased. That will be possible only when the Member States fully recognize the efforts and appreciate the role of the United Nations in global issues and accept the virtues of common interest and the facts of universal partnership.\n235.\tThe question of Namibia has reached a stage where vigorous efforts have to be made and effective measures taken to compel South Africa to accept world opinion and yield to the legitimate will of the Namibian people. We should by no means remain mere spectators while the Pretoria regime escalates its oppression of the Namibian people and even crosses international borders at will. Maldives remains committed to support the Namibian people in whatever way it can in their struggle for self-determination and freedom under the leadership of their national liberation movement, SWAPO, and will support any measure taken by the world community, collectively or individually, towards the achievement of the independence of Namibia. It is our hope that soon we shall be celebrating the end of this complex episode, as we did not so long age in the case of Rhodesia, and other colonial territories in Africa.\n236.\tThe situation in the Middle East has deteriorated during the last one and a half years with the continuation of the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories and its persistent aggressive policies against the Palestinian people, who are fighting for their legitimate right to a fully sovereign and independent nation of their own, which cannot be denied under any decent human consideration. The recent indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon by Israel and the newly organized terrorist activities aimed at the liquidation of the Palestinian struggle are further evidence of a policy of callous disregard for the norms of international behavior. The events which continue to occur in the area make us believe that unless firm measures are taken towards bringing an end to the Israeli occupation and towards the solution of the Palestinian issue, the Middle East will remain a dangerous hotbed of tension, affecting not only that region but also the whole world.\n237.\tI should like to make special reference to the totally unprovoked attack by the Israeli forces on the Iraqi nuclear plant, which clearly demonstrated the dangerous strategic policies adopted by Israel with absolute disregard for the principles accepted by the world community, including the closest friends of Israel.\n238.\tDuring this session we are coming back to discuss the outstanding issue of Palestine, and I presume that we are going to reiterate again our firm belief in the legitimate right of the Palestinians to self-determination, without thereby making any further progress in solving the real issue of the Palestinian people.\n239.\tMy delegation shares the view with many other delegations that the Middle East is the most potentially dangerous region in the world. And if we arc concerned about the preservation and maintenance of world peace, it is imperative that we make still greater efforts to solve the question of Palestine without any further delay. A solution to the issue cannot be reached unless Palestinians arc given the full right to express their free will through their legitimate representatives, the PLO, in all deliberations concerning this serious and complex issue. We will not believe that there is a partial solution to the problem that can be worked out unilaterally or bilaterally without their participation. Maldives remains fully committed to supporting the Palestinians in their struggle to return to their homeland and establish their own nation.\n240.\tI referred at the beginning of my statement to the new trend of. intervention in internal affairs of independent nations. We can count many incidents of this unacceptable behavior during the past few years, which range from covert plotting to overthrow Governments to blatant military interventions to change the political status and history of countries. As far as my Government is concerned, we perceive these acts of intervention with very grave concern, whether they are committed by a country in the West or in the East, and under any pretext. We feel that while the idea itself is bad enough, the prevailing international atmosphere demonstrates a lack of confidence among the countries, in each other, thus confusing an already difficult situation where no steps could be taken to determine if such an intervention took place for the purpose of helping the Government of a country or for the purpose of domination.\n241.\tI do not want to repeat the views of my country concerning the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea, views which have been made clear on previous occasions and are reflected in our stand in the Assembly, within the nonaligned movement and in the Organization of the Islamic Conference. I shall only stress again our firm belief in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations which deplore interference or intervention in the internal! affairs of sovereign States and guide us to solve conflicts and issues through peaceful means.\n242.\tWhile talking about the solution of conflicts by peaceful means, I wish to refer to the yet unresolved question of Korea. My Government feels that all efforts must be made, collectively and individually, to facilitate the continuation of the dialog between North Korea and South Korea for the purpose of achieving a peaceful reunification as envisaged by the Korean people themselves without arty foreign interference.\n243.\tSimilarly, I wish to. reiterate our support for the people of Cyprus in their efforts to consolidate their independence within the framework of national unity with equal rights for all citizens.\n244.\tMy delegation believes that the creation of nuclear weapon-free zones is a rational and effective measure towards world peace. In this context, we supported the proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in South Asia, which we hope will eventually cover a wider region, or at least will pave the way to creating more subregional nuclear-free zones in Asia and the Pacific.\n245.\tAs far as the Indian Ocean is concerned, Maldives is committed to continuing its policies of nonalignment, as it is determined to keep its territories free from nucleai weapons and not to permit any foreign military bases within its territories. Furthermore, Maldives will continue to work with the littoral States and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean towards the achievement of the objective of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. It is our earnest hope that, through cooperation between the countries of the Indian Ocean and the other concerned Powers, we will be able to find practical ways of fulfilling the aspiration of our peoples regarding this important issue.\n246.\tTurning to the international economic situation, we feel that the commencement of the NorthSouth dialog is essential and that we should not spare any efforts within the framework of the United Nations and with the regional organizations to overcome the disparities of the present economic situation. Reason clearly shows that no single nation, whatever its economic capacity or technological advancement, can build its economy in isolation from the rest of the world. The United Nations is now fully aware of all the dimensions of the problem of the gap between the rich and the poor nations. It would be quite wrong to believe that it is the responsibility of the developing countries to rectify the faults in the current economic situation. The painstaking efforts of the developing countries in the South and the very survival of the least developed countries depend heavily on the establishment of a new international economic order based on equality and justice. Hence it is only fair to expect an early resolution of the remaining difficulties that impede the launching of the global negotiations under the auspices and within the framework of the United Nations.\n247.\tDespite the adverse attitudes shown by a few developed countries, the deliberations which have taken place under the auspices of the United Nations since the inception of the idea of a new international economic order have led to positive results, and we look forward to greater progress. We hope that the forthcoming International Meeting on Cooperation and Development at Cancun will be a further step towards the realization of a new international economic order, based on mutual benefit and cooperation.\n248.\tWe are also pleased to note that at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which was recently held in Paris, it was possible to project the magnitude of the problems faced by the least developed among the developing countries. The least developed countries are resolute in their efforts to improve the social and economic conditions of their peoples, and have already embarked upon ambitious development projects in their countries. However, as we all agree, their efforts and resources alone will not be sufficient for the implementation of those projects. To meet the immediate requirements for assistance to the least developed countries for the first half of the decade and greater requirements later in the decade, the international community, and particularly the developed countries, should increase their concessional assistance at least fourfold by 1990 as compared to the level reached in the late 1970s. At the same time, we feel that there is a need to look back at the criteria on which aid flow is decided. Maldives, being one of the smallest and poorest among the least developed countries, faces difficulties arising from the existing criteria, which are sometimes ineffective and often do not look after the needs of the smaller countries. Donors, including the international agencies, may decide on the quantity of aid on a purely per capita basis, with the result that countries that cannot count their population in millions are left out in the cold. Maldives does not want to remain for ever a least developed country. However, because of our limited resources, on the one hand, and the difficult geographic and demographic conditions of the country, on the other, we face a dilemma in our efforts to come out of the present situation without depending considerably on external assistance. We are indeed grateful to all the countries and international agencies which are assisting us in the development process and we hope their support will continue.\n249.\tBefore the conclusion cf my remarks, I wish to reiterate my country's commitment to upholding the principles and the objectives of the United Nations, with their inherent implications of responsibility towards peace and justice and international cooperation. The Maldivian people will continue to work with the United Nations and the world community as a whole for the fulfillment of these lofty objectives.\n250.\tI hope this session will be a successful one.\n"

        "file_text": " Lebanon is particularly pleased whenever another small State is admitted to the United Nations. I should like to welcome Vanuatu and Belize, whose citizens include communities of Lebanese origin of whom we \\\" are very proud.\n136.\tI should like also at the beginning of this statement to pay tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, who imparted a new spirit of discipline to the\nGeneral Assembly during his eventful term of office. Lebanon had known him as President of the Security Council in difficult days and experienced his friendship as well as his fairness and dedication to justice and peace.\n137.\tRarely has the election to the office of the President of the General Assembly had such significance as that of the President of the present session. I should therefore like to go beyond the customary personal congratulations that he merits and to speak about his country, Iraq, a country which is close to the heart of every Arab.\n138.\tWe are particularly happy to see an Arab elected President of the General Assembly. We take pride and find comfort in his election, despite the most unusual circumstances. Indeed, it indicates a tacit support for Iraq and a condemnation of Israeli aggression against his country's capital city, Baghdad.\n139.\tBaghdad, however, would not have been attacked had the international community taken prior action and deterred Israel when it usurped Lebanese territory and violated Lebanese airspace and territorial waters. Similarly, the failure of the international Organization to preserve Arab Palestine led to the occupation of Sinai and the Golan Heights. This failure led in turn to the violation of Lebanese borders and transported the war into Lebanese territory itself. Should the situation remain unchanged, our speeches about international security and peace in the Middle East will remain purely rhetorical. Aggression will lead to further aggression and the scope of war will expand in every-varying forms and shapes.\n140.\tHence, would we be overly ambitious if we were to expect, in this President's term of office, at least an attempt to move the General Assembly from a pattern of resolutions which merely embody principles towards a more practical and pragmatic approach? Meanwhile, we should continue to seek the restitution of our rights and work towards the achievement of a just and comprehensive solution.\n141.\tI say this because between the United Nations and my country there is a covenant of trust and alliance which enables us to speak so freely and confidently. For we have obtained from the international Organization something which other countries have not. Perhaps we stand as the only State that has recovered occupied territory by a resolution of the Security Council. We therefore know the capabilities of the Organization and if we expect more of it, it is because we strongly believe that there is no road to international security except through and within the United Nations framework.\n142.\tIt is in the name of this faith that the United Nations, whose Members come to this rostrum to offer support for Lebanon or to cry over its ruins, are responsible, morally as much as legally, for the preservation of Lebanon. The United Nations is duty bound to help Lebanon to recover its sovereignty, to restore its authority over its entire territory, and to preserve its territorial integrity, the unity of its people and of the State. Similarly, the United Nations is morally and legally committed to save Jerusalem from Judaization and to enable the Palestinian people to recover its legitimate rights. The General Assembly has voted year after year for those rights; yet they remain usurped and violated.\n143.\tWe say this with agony in our hearts. Lebanon would have wanted to be in a position to discuss world issues, rather than see the world preoccupied with its own problem. Lebanon, for instance, would have wanted to contribute more effectively to the NorthSouth dialog, given our geographical position and our traditional role as a forum for dialog and a point of encounter in the history of civilization.\n144.\tYet how can we, when our land has been torn asunder and our people are uprooted and dispersed because the North and South, as well as the East and West, have chosen to draw their borderlines across our bodies? Our cities, which were once houses of peace, are now in ruins and our people speak one language- the the language of reason, but that of madness and despair.\n145.\tIn his annual report to the General Assembly, the Secretary-General stated that since 1975 \\\"The situation in Lebanon has remained a major preoccupation of the Organization up to the present time\\\" and that it has been \\\"a major and tragic feature of the international scene\\\" [see A136/1, sect. //].\n146.\tNo one ignores or can pretend to ignore the infinite wisdom of the Secretary-General in his assessment of events and the caution with which he calls on the United Nations to assume its responsibilities under the Charter. From this perspective, his discussion of the situation in Lebanon acquires particular importance when he states:\n\\\"The ongoing tragedy of Lebanon is a telling reminder of the absolute necessity of embarking on the path of negotiations, however steep and difficult it may prove. The recently arranged ceasefire provides an opportunity that must not be missed, for it will not easily recur. No ceasefire, peacekeeping operation or other expedient for containing the conflict can, in the end, prevent new outbursts of violence as long as the basic elements of the problem are not tackled in negotiations involving all the parties concerned.\\\" [Ibid., sect. IV.]\n147.\tThe words of the Secretary-General, though calm and measured, are none the less a warning. Ever since the war started on our soil, the Government of Lebanon has been sounding the same alarm in the Assembly, year after year, as well as in the Security Council and before the appropriate regional organizations. Mr. Waldheim's words are a definition of the framework of the Lebanese question. They compel us, first and foremost, to declare in utter frankness that the ceasefire called for by the Security Council in resolution 490 (1981) of July 1981 is not an end in itself. Indeed, we cannot allow it to be considered an end o. to become a goal. We cannot confine ourselves, as more than one speaker has called for in the Assembly, to consolidating it, to expanding it, or to be satisfied simply with maintaining it.\n148.\tOf course, our concern that hostilities not be resumed is no less intense than the concern of others. For, although we have not been a party to the hostilities, our own house has been destroyed and the majority of those killed and wounded have been innocent Lebanese civilians. Our attitude is dictated by our belief that a ceasefire is only a temporary measure. If a ceasefire is allowed to become permanent, or semipermanent, it can only serve to exacerbate the plight of the victims of aggression.\n149.\tWhat we demand, therefore, is that Lebanon, the victim, should not remain at the mercy of that fragile and uncertain ceasefire, lest the world forget that the enemy is indeed inside our borders. Our case against Israel in the Security Council should remain whole. What we are seeking is the total withdrawal of Israel, an end to its current attacks against us and the full and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)) and subsequent resolutions. Thus UNIFIL must be deployed fully and effectively and .our internationally recognized borders should become secure and respected again, as stipulated in the provisions of the General Armistice Agreement between Israel and Lebanon signed on 23 March 1949.5\n150.\tMay I now express Lebanon's gratitude and appreciation to those Governments, friends and brothers, from near and far, who have proclaimed before the Assembly and elsewhere Israel's guilt and have defended the cause of Lebanon. May I mention in particular the nonaligned countries and the European group. At this juncture I would merely suggest that we take note of the many constructive ideas proposed in the Assembly and outside it to enable the United Nations to assume its responsibilities in Lebanon fully.\n151.\tThe international responsibilities assumed by the United Nations in Lebanon are varied and they are increasing every day, especially in the fields of development and reconstruction. International agencies and organizations perform in certain areas tasks which the Lebanese authorities are sometimes unable to assume, for well known security reasons. Our deep gratitude is extended to those international agencies and organizations particularly UNICEF for their act of faith in Lebanon.\n152.\tWe also wish to pay a particular tribute to the peacekeeping forces for the heroic task they are accomplishing. They have come from faraway lands, from east and west, and they have shed their blood for peace. We pray that Lebanon be worthy of those martyrs and deserve the faith of those who believe in its cause.\n153.\tBefore the most recent Israeli aggression, Lebanon addressed a memorandum to the Secretary-General stating that in response to the Security Council and in compliance with Security Council resolution 488 (1981) of June 1981, it was determined to send contingents of the Lebanese Army to the\\\" barracks at Maijayoun, Tyre, Nabatiyah and Hasbaya, where they would assume their security tasks. Such contingents would supplement the Lebanese Army detachments now performing in areas of UNIFIL operation under UNIFIL command.\n154.\tIn calling for a summit meeting to discuss the problem of south Lebanon, Lebanon informed the League of Arab States that the Lebanese Army was determined to assume its full duties in defending Lebanese territory in the face of any new Israeli aggression, and that Lebanon was also requesting assistance from the Arab States within the framework of the Joint defense and Economic Cooperation Treaty Between the States of the Arab League, to bear along with it the responsibility for what would happen in the south, where our territory had become the sole battlefield in the ArabIsraeli confrontation and where a war of attrition was being waged, a war which was consuming Lebanon alongside the Palestinians and the entire Arab world.\n155.\tAs we have referred to the Joint defense Treaty, we should like to affirm solemnly before the Assembly that article 11 thereof expressly provides for non-encroachment on the rights and obligations emanating from the Charter of the United Nations and the responsibilities assumed by the Security Council. Lebanon has clearly stated to the parties concerned and wishes to reiterate here that whatever it may request in accordance with the Joint defense Treaty is not and will not be contrary to its obligations under the General Armistice Agreement of 1949, Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and subsequent resolutions. Indeed, it is Israel which persistently violates the General Armistice Agreement and defies international resolutions, while Lebanon abides by those resolutions and constantly calls for the reactivation of the Agreement.\n156.\tWe fear that in the south we may be facing a new \\\"West Bank\\\". The international community must not permit that to happen. Ours, too, is a sacred land and it is neither for sale nor for hire. We are confident that the world community will reject, as we do, Israel's determination to profit from south Lebanon as just another commodity in its bazaar of ambitions. Neither Lebanon nor the United Nations can remain forever hostage to a state of \\\"no war, no peace\\\", maintained by Israel. For such a situation would perpetuate the Israeli occupation and pave the way for the conspiracies of displacement, resettlement and partition rejected by all and recognized by none.\n157.\tIn the past, it may have appeared convenient for friends and foes alike that the south, and perhaps the whole of Lebanon, should remain in a state of flux, at the mercy of a ceasefire here and a resumption of hostilities there. Let us remind this Assembly that the pertinent Security Council resolutions do not merely affirm Lebanon's independence and territorial integrity, but also commit the Organization to assist Lebanon in reestablishing its sovereignty and authority over all of its territory, so that the south may be transformed into a zone of peace. For, just as war came to Lebanon from the south, so must peace originate there if it is ever to return to the entire country.\n158.\tThe tragic situation in Lebanon, the sometimes blazing and oftentimes half-blazing war, whether in the south, at Beirut, or at Zahle, is sufficient to prove that we cannot forever solve crises by a ceasefire and a return to the status quo ante and present that as a victory for peace. Hence, the necessity for us all to allow international as well, as regional decisions to assume their full and undiminished political dimensions. Let those who are committed to those decisions declare that their commitment is not in words but in deeds, that it can be implemented and that they will cooperate unequivocally and without reservations in establishing peace in the south and throughout Lebanon.\n159.\tIf the war in Lebanon, as frequently stated here, is connected organically and historically with the Middle East question, peace in Lebanon cannot wait for regional peace to be established and for a just and comprehensive solution to be found. In so far as peace in Lebanon was destroyed by the Palestinian wars, we fear today that peace in the Middle East may in turn become and casualty of the war, or indeed wars, now being waged in Lebanon. Furthermore, if peace in the Middle East doe^ not emanate from Lebanon, we fear that it will falter and its course will be hindered forever.\n160.\tLet us present the following facts as proof of our argument. First, by allowing international and regional conflicts to continue in Lebanon, the country has been increasingly transformed into a series of time-bombs that will explode and destroy both State and society in the region through despair, revolution and civil wars. By attempting to destroy Lebanon, by nurturing ambitions to devour its dismembered body and by usurping its role, the region not only has divided the Lebanese people but has lost its own balance as well. Has not one Government after another been proclaiming its fear that it would become another Lebanon? In reality it is Lebanon that must ask itself and others: can the Arabs still save themselves if they lose Lebanon?\n161.\tSecondly, Israel's war against Lebanon, waged on the pretext of striking at the Palestine resistance movement, is only a more brutal aspect of its regional strategy. When the enemy carves away at the South and contributes to the creation of objective conditions for blowing up Lebanese society and government, and instigates fratricidal wars within Lebanon between Lebanese and their brethren, it does so to divert the Arabs away from the Holy Land, to distract the Palestinians with an alternative revolution, to lure them with an alternative homeland and to dangle before them the illusion of an alternative State as well. That deception has already erected walls of hatred and fear, both inside and outside Lebanon, and has given the impression that even Lebanon's international borders are in question. If this situation is allowed to continue, what will be in question is not only the integrity of Lebanon, but also the boundaries, the frontiers and the very independence of each and every country in the area. Hie States of the region and their borders constitute in reality an integrated whole. If they are tampered with, the independence of all countries will be at stake and the way will be opened for a redrawing of the entire map of the Middle East.\n162.\tThirdly, the displacement of the regional center of gravity towards the Gulf for economic and geopolitical reasons has not reduced Lebanon's importance. On the contrary, while oil is produced and exported from the Gulf, the lifeline of the Middle East continues to take its course through Mediterranean shores. Everything is imported through our routes; civilization and the revolt against it; prosperity and terror; liberation and colonialism; the forces for stability as well as the forces which make for destruction when released by hatred and anger.\n163.\tThese are not fantasies and mirages we are unleashing in this Hall and in the corridors of Arab and international politics to torture ourselves and others. They are realities. They are the tragic and bitter truth as it reveals itself to the scrutinizing eye.\n164.\tNevertheless, *we come here to affirm that Lebanon can still be saved despite the dangers that continue to besiege it and that threaten it with a fate similar to that which has befallen other peoples and States. What, then, is Lebanon gambling on? What is it that inspires Lebanon with such confidence?\n165.\tIn his speech of 23 September 1981, made on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his assuming the Presidency, Mr. Elias Sarkis, the President of Lebanon, stated:\n\\\"In the beginning and in the end, Lebanon represents a national consensus on a model homeland of freedom governed by democracy. . . .\n\\\"Lebanon has patiently suffered unbearable wounds. More than once in the course of its history, it has remained steadfast, confronting dangers that threatened its very existence. Lebanon has always overcome its adversities and recovered its vitality, thus earning from the world admiration following upon sympathy and concern following upon indifference. . . .\n\\\"Credit for such achievements is due first to the unity of the Lebanese national will, which is manifest in its tenacious sense of belonging to the one Lebanon, where an urgent need has been universally felt for legitimacy based on freedom, democracy and national sovereignty. ...\\\"\nPresident Sarkis went on tr say, \\\"I am staking our future on this united national will. No option other than dialog can save our homeland\\\".\n166.\tThe Lebanon of dialog, always rising from the ruins, counts not only on its national unity, but also on its Arab identity and its ability to perform its historical mission in its own environment and in the world at large.\n167.\tThe trials that Lebanon has suffered and survived have proven beyond doubt that what divides the Lebanese is much less important than what unites them. What distinguishes them as a group even from those nearest to them is more profound than what distinguishes them one from the other within the national community.\n168.\tSuffice it to say that there is no one in Lebanon today who does not give his allegiance to Lebanon absolute priority over any other friendship, relationship, partnership or alliance which could distract him from the community vanity and its institutions. The differences, which are getting thinner and thinner on the ground every day, can be absorbed by the framework of democratic institutions, which, although scarred, have overcome eight years of being held hostage.\n169.\tViolence has not succeeded in stifling liberty. The ferociousness of the Lebanese in defense of their beloved land has been legendary. Rarely has a small country been able to endure all that we have endured and still remain united and sovereign, clinging to life with tenacity, and able to survive. Whenever a house was destroyed, another was built there, on the same spot. Whenever a source of livelihood was ended, several were rediscovered in its stead. And whenever the clouds of war disperse and the sound of bombs is lulled, Lebanon comes back to life with zest and confidence, as though death were not a reality but merely an illusion.\n170.\tThe Lebanese people look forward today more than ever before to a near future perhaps a rendezvous with hope when the State will return with all its institutions intact, strong and able to restore its legality and establish its authority over every span of land in Lebanon. A most potent expression of that confidence was the working paper submitted by Lebanon to the follow-up committee established at Beit ed Dine by a decision of the Arab summit conference. Lebanon is legitimately confident that the Arab States, especially cur sisterState of Syria, will contribute not only to the achievement of a short-term national reconciliation but also to the creation of the appropriate atmosphere and conditions for a new historic covenant, a pact of unity to be manifested in a new society and new institutions capable of meeting the challenges of the crisis and of its solutions: the challenges of war and of peace.\n171.\tLebanon, which has come to believe that its strength lies not in its weakness but in its ability to defend its territory and its rights, considers that its primary duty is now to complete the reconstruction of its army, with assistance from brother Arab States as well as all its friends, so that it may gradually shoulder alone its full and undiminished defense responsibilities and participate fully and with undiminished involvement in Arab strategic cations. Then, and only then, will a secure Lebanon become a true guarantee of the peace of its brethren rather than a source of fear for its own security as well as for theirs. Then, and only then, will it cease to derive often unsuccessfully its own security from the security of others.\n172.\tAlthough acts of heroism throughout Lebanon's ancient and modern military history have been many and meaningful, we know that they will never be Lebanon's greatest and most important achievements. It is important, however, to remember that they have always been associated, as in our heyday, the era of Emir Fakhreddine, with the integration of the Lebanese communities in the national entity. The challenge of civilization compels us to follow that example. The world around us is disturbed by fear of communal strife whose victims have not been .confined to Lebanon, and it is perturbed by currents of religious politics which, if allowed to dominate, would doom Lebanon to destruction.\n173.\tSignificant in this context is the testimony of Ignatius IV, Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, in his address to the Third Islamic Summit conference, held at MeccaTaif from 25 to 28 January 1981, when he equated Lebanon with Jerusalem:\n\\\"In Jerusalem we seek the face of God, and we also seek it in Lebanon. ...\n\\\"Lebanon is a source of warmth for all. It is a place for the meeting and interaction of ideas so that all ideas may belong to all. The beauty of the meeting there of Christians and Moslems is unparalleled. It is a goal and an aspiration, a forum for innovation and creation, a bright face smiling on everyone. Indeed, it is a consolation for all. . . .\t'\n\\\"Our unity is affected by the unity of Lebanon, and our health is a function of its health. Its unity is its right; its health is its right; its peace is its right. . . .\n\\\"Lebanon today craves Jerusalem in its uniqueness and originality, and Jerusalem today craves Lebanon in its uniqueness and originality. . . .\n\\\"Jerusalem and Lebanon are the two poles and the two pillars of the Arab world. Each of them is necessary for any peace in that world.\\\"\n174.\tPeace! Peace! Never has peace been such an existential historical necessity as it is today. Not only is it our goal in Lebanon; it is also the national objective around which we in the Arab world unite.\n175.\tI should like to conclude my statement by returning to international politics. I should like to cite a few attitudes that will prove our concern for peace and our understanding of the conditions for its achievement.\n176.\tFirst, there is the Arab consensus, especially in Lebanon, to reject the autonomy negotiations agreed upon at Camp David, because they seek to achieve peace where it is not to be found. The Palestine question belongs to the Palestinians. Real peace must be peace for the land and the people alike. Only the establishment of the Palestinian State in the Palestinian homeland through negotiations with PLO, the legitimate representative of Palestinian rights, can achieve such a peace. No peace would be achieved in Palestine or in the Middle East if, as a result, the Palestinian people were to continue to be displaced and their revolution were to be perpetuated in some eternal diaspora, whether in Lebanon or elsewhere.\n177.\tSecondly, there is the continued Arab support of United Nations resolutions for a just and comprehensive solution of the Middle East question. More than one Arab official has, both before this Assembly and elsewhere, pointed out what might be derived from these and incorporated into an integral peace plan based on the recognition of the rights of all peoples and States of the region, including the eventual Palestinian State, to achieve security based on mutual recognition.\n178.\tThirdly, there is the Arab opposition to the establishment of a strategic alliance between Israel and the United States at a time when the world expected Washington to use its influence to prevent Israel from persisting in its aggressive policy and using the pretext of security to project its borders where greed and expansion take it, thus threatening the world with the danger of a nuclear war. It is obvious that that \\\"strategic alliance\\\", if continued,, will prevent any serious American contribution towards ensuring stability in the area, through what Washington has described as a \\\"strategic consensus\\\". Needless to say, a strategic consensus is destined to remain an illusion unless it expresses the peoples' rights and their common faith in their freedom and the justice of their cause.\n179.\tFourthly, there is the Arab' positive response, including Lebanon's, to the Soviet call for an international peace conference on the Middle East. Such a call must, however, be based on United Nations decisions and must solely seek their implementation. It should not lead to another \\\"strategic consensus\\\", nor should it seek to establish an ideological partnership whereby one system will confront another, whether inside or outside the Middle East\n180.\tI have voiced before the Assembly some expressions of the Arab approach to peace as perceived by my country. Indeed, we work for peace in the belief that it shields Lebanon, its safety and its unity. This, then, is not only the policy of rulers; rather, it is the deep expression of popular yearning in the hearts of tortured and helpless nations.\n181.\tThe twentieth century has witnessed their liberation from colonialism and their resurgence into the light only to see themselves threatened by a new, multidimensional form of colonialism, even before the end of the generation that witnessed their renaissance. This neocolonialism prevents them from advancing along the path of freedom and prosperity, unable to enjoy their newly developed natural wealth and to contribute constructively to the creation of a new world, East and West, North and South.\n182.\tThat is the reality of Arab idealism. And yet it is also the deeper meaning of the Arab tragedy manifested in both the Lebanese question and the Palestine question.\n183.\tFor colonialism has equated the two peoples. The injustice inflicted on one people led to the infliction of injustice on the other. The loss of the Holy Land led to the destruction of what was the homeland of liberty and love: Lebanon. It caused the torture of its people and their dispersion. Peace cannot return to the Middle East, and there can be no return to the Holy Land, uniess Lebanon recovers its vitality, its unity and its liberties and until peace returns to its martyred land.\n184.\tHence, it is in the name of that peace that our tortured people cry out today before the nations of the world herein assembled: give us back our homeland. We shall neither forget nor forgive, nor shall we compromise or submit, until Lebanon is returned to us.\n"

        "file_text": "268.Permit me, on behalf of the Sierra Leone delegation, to extend to the President our warmest congratulations on his election to preside over the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We have every confidence that his long association with the United Nations, both in the capacity of representative of his country and as an official of the Organization over the years, equips him eminently well to discharge the functions of the high office he now occupies with distinction.\n269.\tLet me also pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, who during his tenure made excellent contributions to bringing us still nearer to the goals of the United Nations, particularly in the field of global social and economic justice.\n270.\tThe United Nations itself represents a culmination of the evolution of man's historic yearning for peace and his universal desire to promote economic and social well being, to improve the quality of life and to weave diverse political, ethnic, cultural and religious particularizations into a more harmonious and accommodating system. The General Assembly has come to represent a kind of shrine, as it were, at which nations of the world forgather annually, as we do here today, to express this universal yearning for peace and progress. Notwithstanding numerous frustrations in its path throughout its 3$ years of existence, it has persisted in keeping alive its noble and laudable objectives.\n271.\tHeedless of the cherished hopes which attended the birth of the Organization, we have in recent years become unwilling spectators of a world increasingly rearming itself as if in final preparation for Armageddon. Without doubt, the accelerating arms race continues to be the most Serious threat to the human race. In the face of want, deprivation and scarcity in many parts of the world, we are compelled to watch helplessly while scarce resources are frittered away in the accumulation of more deadly, more expensive and more destructive arsenals, resulting today in what for many of us is a frightening disproportion between the means of survival and the means of destruction.\n272.\tThree years ago the United Nations expressed its grave concern over this issue by convening a special session devoted to the question of disarmament. In its Declaration [resolution 5/0/2], the General Assembly at the tenth special session recognized the widespread, retrogressive and disintegrative effects of the arms race on the fabric of world peace and security and concluded that, not only did it run counter to efforts to achieve further relaxation of international tension and the establishment of genuine peace, but it also constituted a considerable drag on the world's social and economic development. It is, therefore, particularly distressing to see that three years later the situation not only has worsened but has in fact been compounded with the accretion of new weapon systems added to an already diabolical collection, which further endangers the future of our world. All this is done under the pretext of defense and security needs.\n273.\tOne sure lesson of history throughout the ages has been that there is no security in armament, let alone in its accumulation. The only assurance of peace and survival is justice and tolerance.\n274.\tIt is, in our view, as pernicious as it is inhuman to believe that a balance of terror can ensure the peace of the world; for there can be no dividends in a holocaust we are all losers. Let those, then, who would condemn our world to the uncertainty of a nuclear future, hold a nuclear sword of Damocles over our heads, and hold to ransom the hopes of humanity, search their consciences.\n275.\tIt is against this backdrop of anxiety and uncertainty that we have come to witness a depressing deterioration in the world political climate. Indeed, today we face veritable global crises of confidence. There is a crisis of confidence between those who would arrogate to themselves the responsibility of being guardians of world peace. There is also a crisis of confidence in regard to the very survival of our world. Moreover, there is a crisis of confidence among the overwhelming masses of humanity, stemming from uncertainty concerning whether the affluent half of our world has any interest in their wellbeing and welfare.\n276.\tHow could this not be so, when today we observe helplessly the investment of some $500 billion annually in the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction, instead of these resources being made available for economic development and improving the life of our people? We. have within our grasp the economic, scientific and technological capabilities to effect a great improvement in human prosperity, welfare and advancement, and this Organization owes it to mankind to ensure that we utilize these capabilities for nobler ends.\n277.\tIt is in the face of these global crises of confidence that we are setting off on a new decade. We submit, therefore, with ail humility that the international agenda for this current decade and beyond should be composed of items and measures to restore faith and confidence in the human will and desire to survive in peace and prosperity. This is the essence and raison d'etre of the United Nations. Above all, the United Nations must now more than ever before be instrumental in effecting global confidence-building measures to assure us of peace, prosperity and security.\n278.\tWe return on our annual pilgrimage to yet another session of the General Assembly, again, as in the immediate past, with an air of gloom over the world economy. The global economic situation, as in the past several years, still offers a familiar and depressing picture.\n279.\tFor developed industrialized countries, the postwar era of boom and prosperity seems to be running out of steam and the long period of growth seems to be halted in its track by a general recession, exacerbated by monetary instability, high interest rates and mounting unemployment.\n280.\tFor most developing countries, the rising cost of imports of manufactures, oil and food, the deteriorating terms of trade and the worsening balance of payment deficits have all, over the period, set in with particular severity to make life more miserable for their peoples and make more distant and difficult the prospect of realizing their human development.\n281.\tAll this demonstrates that the world economy needs today the imagination, the courage and the necessary will not only to restructure it but to give it the necessary momentum to keep it on an even keel. In the meantime, we in the developing countries have experienced and are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining the necessary cooperation in evolving lasting and more responsive solutions to the continuing deterioration in our economic situation. This, we submit, is not a case of special pleading. The object lesson of the present global economic gloom clearly illustrates that our interdependent world will not brook prosperity in one half while the other half continues to languish in want and deprivation. Global wellbeing will remain illusory unless and until the aspirations and needs of the developing countries are reflected in the management of the international economy and in the decisions resulting from international negotiations.\n282.\tIt is in this context that we believe that the United Nations must now more than ever before address itself seriously to the immediate necessity of launching the global round of negotiations, which would facilitate the implementation of the fundamental restructuring which we all voted for as far back as 1974 in adopting General Assembly resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI).\n283.\tNow more than ever before it is clear that changes in international economic relationships are necessary, in the interests of both rich and poor nations, in our quest for more equity, both within States and among States, and everything must now be done to forge a global consensus on a program of survival and to translate the emergent consensus into action.\n284.\tHowever, inasmuch as we should welcome measures and initiatives that may help facilitate the process and, indeed, promote and inspire the imperatives of international cooperation, it is our belief that the central role of the United Nations and the necessity for the participation of all States in the process cannot be overemphasized, for the amalgam of global economic problems we are experiencing today will not admit of parochial or selective solutions. It is in this light, therefore, that we welcome the forthcoming Conference at Cancun.\n285.\tAlthough the Mexico summit of 22 countries cannot negotiate for the rest of the world, we believe it can nevertheless raise the level of consultations and provide the improved climate necessary for forging that consensus so vital for tackling the ills of the encircling global economic gloom.\n286.\tTen years ago the Assembly, with dawning appreciation of the magnitude of the problem of international economic development, given the uneven availability and spread of global resources, identified a group of the most disadvantaged members of the world community [resolution 2768 (XXVI)]. It was felt that members of this group, the least developed countries, as they are euphemistically called, would have their prospects of self-sustaining development and viability enhanced if they were the object of special care and attention.\n287.\tGlobal concern for the distressing and deteriorating situation of this group of States came to a head at the recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Paris. Regrettably, the outcome of this Conference did not, in our view, match the hopes and expectations that inspired it. We can only, therefore, appeal to those members of the international community that can afford it to help; this is a clear case of self-interested altruism because there can be no peace, justice, happiness or stability in this our interdependent world if a significant proportion of its members continue to wallow in poverty, ignorance and disease.\n288.\tEvery so often mankind confirms its ability to respond to crises with resilience, imagination and determination. Such adaptation and resilience are no doubt essential for the survival of the human race. Regrettably, however, man has yet to muster his technological capabilities, skill, imagination and dexterity to achieve and ensure an adequate and reliable quantum of energy for his survival. Energy in its diverse manifestations remains one of the most important factors for progress, and its continued availability on a sustained and reliable basis is without doubt indispensable to technological and socioeconomic development.\n289.\tWe are therefore encouraged by the seriousness, dedication and direction demonstrated at the recent United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. It is the view of my delegation that the program of Action adopted at Nairobi\\\" contains the necessary perceptions and policy guidelines for us to initiate practical measures to facilitate the effective and reliable supply of that essential resource in its various forms.\n"

        "file_text": "In speaking at this time of great mourning which has stricken one of the Members of the Organization, namely Egypt, I should like must of all to offer to the Government and people of Egypt the sincere and profound condolences of the Government and the people of Togo. My condolences are addressed likewise to the whole of the bereaved family of the great President Anwar El Sadat, a leading figure in the fight for peace and justice In Egypt, in the Middle Bast, and throughout the world. In his permanent quest for peace, President El Sadat carried out an act of political courage, thereby giving rise to great hope among men of good will. May the work of peace thus started be continued and concluded for the happiness of the worthy people of Egypt-\n95.. The modern world in which, we live is one of complementarities No nation can live sufficient unto itself. All the countries of the world must lend a hand and help each other. But that mutual aid results from the freely expressed will of each people to join its efforts with those of the others in order to bring about the necessary means for the solution of major problems that confront the whole of the international community.\n96. Indeed, in this last quarter of the twentieth century the world continues to live under the threat of scourges that modern science, in despite of its prestigious progress, has not been able to stop completely. Today hunger, malnutrition. illiteracy and disease still afflict more than half of mankind, while a tiny proportion of the globe's population lives in opulence.\n97.\tThere is the impression that certain nations, placing their bets on their apparent power believe that complementarity means the subjugation of the poorest to the .richest of our planet. Then, in order to intimidate, they have recourse to arrogance and the demonstration of their strength; next, they violate the independence of other States flow the freedoms of the weakest nations, attack peoples an< read upon the Integrity of sovereign countries. Independence and freedom must be the major preoccupation of this last quarter of the twentieth century: independence, so as to guarantee respect for the traditional civilizations of each people, making it possible for it to contribute within the limits of its means to universal civilization; freedom, so that the peoples of the world in mutual respect of their differences might decide, without any constraints, on the forms of association essential to the complementarity of both the material and human resources of the planet, the noble objective being to ensure to each the full enjoyment of the goods produced by the universal toil of all men.\n98.\tThis yearning for independence and freedom is one of the first expressions of human rights, a right of which all peoples are quite appropriately jealous. Thus the ancient traditions of independence and freedom of the peoples of Asia Minor, Including Iraq, have been the admiration of all men, throughout all ideologies and all centuries. Mr. Kittani belongs to those traditions, and his election to preside over the work of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly augurs well. That is why I am pleased to congratulate him, and I am sure that under his presidency our work will be conducted in justice, the guarantee of independence and freedom.\n99.\tI should also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, and to congratulate him on the masterly way in which he conducted the work of the previous, session.\n100.\tI should like also to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the Government of Tbgo, the Secretary-General of the Organization for the tireless efforts that he has constantly been making in the service of peace and concord throughout the world.\n101.\tFinally, to guarantee the independence and freedom so dear to us, the United Nations family can grow in strength only by expanding. That is why we hall the admission of Vanuatu as.the one hundred fifty-fifth Member of the United Nations and, on behalf of the Government of Togo, address our hearty congratulations to the leaders of that country and wish them complete success in their task of building their country.\n102.\tWe also congratulate Belize on its admission as the one hundred fifty-sixth Member of the Organization.\n103.\tThis year again, in spite of the hopes born of political changes in a large number of countries by the expression of the will of the peoples concerned, the Independence and freedom of peoples are once again sorely tested. Certain countries, because they are endowed by nature and history with more or less abundant resources, take upon themselves the right to dictate their economic conditions to the whole of mankind and thereby bring\nabout an Imbalance among nations which is prejudicial to the harmony and stability of the rest of the world. Accordingly, the political and economic independence of certain young States is seriously imperiled as a result of the unilateral decisions taken by certain other States.\n1Q4. At its present session the General Assembly must, if the United Nations wishes genuinely to achieve the noble objectives that it has set for itself, deal seriously with those grave infringements on the independence and freedom of peoples and citizens. At the very hour when our work is in progress such violations of independence and freedom are still common currency, whether in respect of international economic relations or the policy of relations among States.\n105- In terms of international economic relations, the situation has never been more serious. From year to year the poorest countries continue to become even poorer, and their external debt has attained unbearable proportions, given their low level of development. Indeed, the newly independent countries, in trying to raise the level of living of their peoples, set up schools and educate their citizens, develop public health and provide the communication infrastructures which are essential for every human community of our time, can rely only on their own natural resources. Any assistance from the international community, in one form or another, is in the last analysis always seen in terms of loans against the resources of the country concerned. Those resources are generally made up of raw materials the prices of which vary depending on the whims of the developed countries. Since the oil crisis of 1973, the prices for those raw materials have been constantly falling, while at the same time the prices for manufactured goods purchased from the rich countries have been rising constantly.\n106.\tThe height of irony is that the interest rates on loans granted by industrialized countries for the development projects of developing countries are shamelessly approaching usurious rates. These combined factors the fall in the prices of raw materials, the swift rise in the prices of imported products from developed countries and the exorbitant increases in interest rates by industrialized countries are upsetting the balance of the countries of the third world, sabotaging their stability and, in the last analysis, making peace precarious. As a result, the inequality in international economic relations, established and maintained essentially by the rich countries, is imperiling the already fragile independence of underdeveloped countries and whittling away their freedom of action. Thus, the independence acquired at the cost of great sacrifices is the object of the covetousness of the great Powers.\n107.\tFreedom, cherished in the rich countries, is denied by those same countries to the poorest on this planet. While the rich countries are establishing within themselves all the conditions for stability and peace in the shadow of which they continue their peaceful development, they provoke because of their rivalries, conflicts in the third world in order to nip in 'lie bud the development efforts of the young nations and to continue to keep them in a state of dependence. Numerous actions of interference and destabilization make it possible for them to get rid of their weapons arsenals, which, if not disposed of, would in the long run become dangerous to themselves.\n108.\tBy supporting apartheid in a covert way, In spite of verbal condemnations, certain great Powers ore helping to deprive the peoples of southern Africa of independence and freedom and are thus perpetuating their subjugation. By condoning through silence South Africa's repeated acts of aggression against Angola, certain great Powers are i giving proof of their intention to call into question the independence of the young States and thus to jeopardize their right to freedom.\n109.\tIn the sphere of international political relations, independence and freedom enjoy no greater guarantees than they do in international economic relations. The international situation at present is less stable than ever, is strained in many parts of the world and is everywhere loaded with conflict. The super-Powers, by competing to divide the world into zones of influence, are like arsonists .who are the first to play the part of firemen as soon as they have finally succeeded in kindling the flames of war and conflict between States. Then they offer to the rest of the world interminable conferences on disarmament together with other idle chatter, while the whole world knows that all that the underdeveloped countries can disT arm themselves of is their poverty.\n110.\tFrom whatever angle one approaches international problems, one always and invariably is led, to the same observation: the military arsenal of the rich countries is too important for them not to want to use it to disturb the peace in the world and thereby guarantee the satisfaction of their selfish interests.\n111.\tLook at what is happening in the Middle East. The Government of Togo has always upheld Israel's right to a homeland. But the Government of my country upholds this same right for others in other words, for the Palestinians, under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative, the PLO. However, for more than 30 years the fires of the Middle East have remained lit. The quantity of . arms stockpiled in the region does not augur well for anything. Most countries of the region, if not all of them, have no arms factories. Their arms always come from the same sources. The most sophisticated weapons go to the first bidder. In the meantime, the rich countries grow richer while the underdeveloped countries each day grow more dependent on the rich, as they are obliged to order new weapons. And at the same time the afflicted Palestinian people remain it) a state of the most cruel displacement\n112.\tLook at what is happening in southern Africa. The most elementary rights of a whole people are being trampled underfoot, but the most extensive campaigns for human rights led by the majority of the rich countries are not being directed against apartheid. On the contrary, more than extenuating circumstances are found in the case of Pretoria, as a policy of so-called persuasion is advocated to bring about domestic change. If only one millionth of what is taking place in South Africa took place in an underdeveloped country, it would already be the object of a plan carefully orchestrated and implemented to upset the regime in place.\n113.\tPretoria attacks Angola, destroys its economy, kills its innocent citizens by the hundreds, and what do you think happened? In a discordant chorus some crocodile tears were shed, but there was also a veto which prevented the proclaiming to the world of the unanimous condemnation of this flagrant violation of the right of the Angolan people to independence, freedom and sovereignty. - All the organizations which normally shout about human rights and amnesty keep' ^ complacent silence.\n114.\tThis is the place to recall that the American people and the African peoples are bound by ties which , have their roots in a centuries-old history. But there arc situations which Africa as a whole does not understand. We dare hope that the present Administration and the great American people will join forces and associate themselves with the inevitable process of the independence of Namibia, as advocated in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In so doing, the great America of President Reagan would strengthen the friendship between the United States and the whole of Africa, as the United Kingdom succeeded in doing under Margaret Thatcher's party at the time of Zimbabwe's accession to independence.\n115.\tThe underdeveloped countries, which are today euphemistically called the \\\"least-developed countries\\\", are precisely the poorest on earth, the countries whose peace and stability are increasingly threatened. Their independence itself is being put to a severe test. Confronted, by serious attempts at destabilization, they are frequently the object of genuine external acts of aggression designed to accentuate the gravity of the difficulties which they have to face. At the same time, in the rich countries are to be found recruiters of mercenaries who go out and gather hordes of armed, paid killers, sow desolation and deprive the citizens of the fruits of independence and freedom which have been so dearly acquired.\n116.\tAre we to believe that the good souls who shed tears over human rights are going to condemn the recruitment of mercenaries and then profit by the criminal behavior of these mercenaries by casting anathema on these killers who come from the same society as they themselves come from? Not at all. Arrest mercenaries and their licensed recruiters and try them with all possible guarantees for their defense: you will be submerged with letters, declarations, articles in newspapers and other mendacious propaganda publications of associations for the rights of I don't know what people.\n117.\tThrough violence and crime, certain desperadoes have sought to jeopardize Egypt's independence by the cowardly assassination of Resident Anwar El Sadat, a great African leader of world stature whose constant, struggle .for peace justly earned him the Nobel Peace Prize a year ago, The whole world will remember the exceptional qualities of this great statesman, whose memory we hail and whose brutal death we greatly regret,. ,\n118.\tThe violence institutionalized in a political system and used by some to govern the relations between States represents a great danger for peace. The occupation of Afghanistan and Kampuchea are part of this danger.\n119.\tIn this connection, we wish to recall Togo's constant position. We believe that peoples must have the freedom to express their political choice without any foreign Interference. The occupation of a country by force goes against the Charter of the United Nations. We appeal to all the States seemed to apply without delay the resolutions of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and of the recent International Conference on Kampuchea.\n120.\tIn South Korea the persistence of a situation the precarious nature :of which escapes no one is preventing She independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. And yet all the great nations of the modem world know what the fruits of national unity are, because throughout their history they themselves have had to fight to achieve their own unity.\n121.\tFor Togo, the fait accompli has never created any rights. Interference in the internal affairs of States and the\n' military occupation of countries by other countries disturb the peace and endanger the independence and freedom of the countries concerned.\n122.\tWith regard to the majority of the great problems of today, Togo shares the concern of other nations. The independence and freedom which we have wrested at the price of great sacrifices must be given to other peoples which continue to suffer.\n123.\tAs regards South Africa, as was recently stated by the President of the Togolese Republic, General of the Army Gnassingbe Eyadema. Togo cannot accommodate itself to the situation of injustice and oppression which prevails at present in this region, where a regime unworthy of man and of cur time and contrary to all mortality is maintaining itself at a cost of unheard-of violence against people whose only wrong is the color of their skin.\\\"\n124.\tAs far as Namibia is concerned, the Founding President of the Rassemblement du peuplc togolaise and Resident of the Togolese Republic expressed Togo's position;  \\\"In the case of Namibia, whose achievement of independence Is inevitable, Ibgo, like the rest of the African countries, wishes this accession to independence to take place in peace, so necessary for all peoples, and with respect for the integrity of its territory.\\\"\nAggressive acts will not prevent Namibia's, accession to independence under the leadership of SWAPO, its sole authentic representative.\n125.\tThe eyes of the whole world have turned with hope towards Western Sahara, where the Moroccan authorities have finally aligned themselves with the sacred principle of the self-determination of peoples, without which independence and freedom have no meaning. However, all the parties concerned, including the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic, must be associated in all phases of this peace process, so as to guarantee the free expression of the principle of self-determination.\n126.\tConcerning the problem of Chad, my country's position and the initiatives which it has taken arc well known. Togo has spared no efforts within the QAU and in connection with many missions of conciliation to bring the contending parties to the negotiating table in order to find lasting solutions to the internal conflict imposed on the fraternal people of Chad, which has suffered far too much from a fratricidal war. That war has ruined the economy of the country and, in the last analysis, has profited only imperialism and its weapons dealers.\n127.\tRegarding Mayotte, Togo once again appeals to the French and Comorian authorities to engage in dialog so that a definitive solution might be found for the reinstatement of the Comorian island of Mayotte as part of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros.\n128.\tIn safeguard independence and freedom, the nations must work together for peace. As- President Eyaddma has quite, appropriately stated:\n\\\"The people of Togo ardently wishes peace and progress for itself and for all the nations. That peace must be real and must contribute to the effective emancipation of our different nations. That is why, faced with the disarray in our world which threatens the international equilibrium, Togo has always advocated recourse to fraternal dialog and permanent consultation in \\\"seeking in peace just solutions for the tragic conflicts . shaking our world, which every day result in the loss of human life.\\\"\nIt is in order to avoid such pointless loss of life and to consolidate the independence and freedom of States that nations large and small must join their efforts so that they may complement each other.\n129.\tIn western Africa such efforts have today made it possible to lay the foundation for the Economic Community of Western African States [ECOWAS], That organization is comprised of 16 States that have decided to regroup in order to create a market of nearly 160 million consumers, thereby offering the greatest possible chances of guaranteeing the political- independence and freedom they have attained since the 1960s. As was staled recently by President Eyaddma:\n\\\"Thus for the past 15 years the people of Togo, reconciled with itself, has been devoting its energies and - its creativity to its development. It is that regained serenity that today makes it possible for our country to participate actively with 15 other States in the restructuring and definition of the goals of our common enterprise aimed at economic integration, ECOWAS. That Community is progressively developing its action in the interest of its populations, which are thus mobilized around consistent goals and invites to embark unreservedly upon a new life in a spirit of solidarity and progress.\\\"\n130.\tIn a world in which selfishness reigns, the independence and freedom of nations cannot be guaranteed unless they understand the urgent need for complementarity and join together to put an end to injustice and to provide the .conditions necessary for peace throughout the world.\n131.\tWithout peace and stability the independence of States is but a vague expression. Without economic independence freedom is an illusion, for, as President Eyaddma has said, \\\"In a world in disarray that is profoundly gripped by doubt, our action must be directed towards settling the essential problems confronting our various societies: famine, disease and ignorance\\\".\n132.\tThat is the mission which the President of the Togolese Republic deeply believes should be undertaken by men of good will if they really wish to defend the independence of nations and to safeguard the freedom of peoples.\n133.\tIt is the sacred mission of the Organization to put into operation every tiling that can peacefully guarantee the independence and freedom of nations. May the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session establish the.necessary landmarks for this historic struggle.\n"

        "file_text": " On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, I wish to congratulate the Assembly on having Mr. Kittani as President of this session. His experience and profound knowledge of the United Nations system will give us invaluable guidance in our work.\n308.\tThe Government of the Netherlands wishes to extend a warm welcome to the new Member of the Organization, the Republic of Vanuatu. We are also looking forward to the forthcoming admission of Belize to membership. On behalf of the Kingdom, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Antilles was present at the independence ceremonies.\n309.\tThe thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place in a political and economic context which challenges the .purposes and principles the Organization has embodied over the past decades. There is cause for concern about the direction in which mankind seems to be moving. This session must summon the efforts of the whole international community to head off the dangers with which humanity is confronted.\n310.\tAfter almost two years, the 1980s present themselves as a critical and dangerous decade for the survival of mankind. The global problems of the nuclear arms race, the. deterioration of the environment, the ever-growing mass poverty and the lack of progress in the restructuring of the world economy, the alarming levels of unemployment everywhere, the continued violations of human rights, the disrespect for the rule of law in international relations pose the question: in what direction is our world heading?\n311.\tThe international political climate has further deteriorated. The situations in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Kampuchea, Central America and southern Africa, in particular, show no sign of easing. Notwithstanding various serious efforts, little real momentum towards solutions has been generated.\n312.\tIn his report on the work of the Organization [A/36/1], the Secretary-General points to a disturbing weakening of the international cooperative effort and an erosion of the system of multilateral cooperation, as well as the dangers of unilateral action which inevitably evoke retaliatory measures. Centrifugal forces are at work within the international system. An increasing number of international consultations on various issues foils to produce concrete results. In some cases international negotiations, which could more fruitfully have been pursued within a recognized multilateral framework, take place outside this Organization, thus frustrating adequate representation of all parties.\n313.\tThe Government of the Netherlands wishes to reaffirm its feelings of responsibility as a Member of the Organization and its dedication to the purposes and principles of the Charter. The system of international cooperation laid down in the Charter provides a framework for peaceful change, a framework for which there is no alternative. In our times, effective use of this instrument is essential.\n314.\tThe United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Secretary, Lord Carrington, has on behalf of the 10 member States of the European Community [8th meeting] clearly set out the principles guiding their activities in the world today and their position on a number of issues. I want to add the following on behalf of the Government of the Netherlands.\n315.\tThree issues are, in the eyes of the Netherlands Government, of critical importance. I am thinking of arms control and nuclear arms limitation, the combating of poverty in the developing world and the restructuring of the economic system, and the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights.\n316.\tThe single most dangerous threat to the survival of mankind is that of nuclear annihilation. Therefore, the quest for nuclear arms control should be vigorously pursued, regardless of the international climate. In a period of mounting tension, the rationale for arms control and disarmament should be even more apparent to all. By their very nature, the nuclear Powers, particularly the United States and the Soviet Union, have a special responsibility. Within and outside the framework of NATO, the Netherlands Government aims at arms control, and in particular the reduction of the role of nuclear arms. It attaches the utmost importance to the forthcoming negotiations between the Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union with a view to a mutual and substantial reduction of the level of armaments, in particular through the reduction and, if possible, elimination of certain types of long-range theater nuclear weapons.\n317.\tThe Netherlands Government considers these negotiations, which will be pursued within the framework of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT], to be vitally important. This pertains also to the rest of the SALT process. Failure to achieve results in that process would lead to an unrestrained nuclear arms race. Such unrestrained vertical proliferation could increase the danger of a widening proliferation in a horizontal sense.\n318.\tA viable nonproliferation regime is essential for the security and survival of us all. The threat of a steadily growing number of potential nuclear Powers calls for the speedy achievement of a consensus in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Therefore, the Netherlands Government will continue to work actively for an international plutonium storage system and for the improvement and strengthening of the safeguards regime of IAEA.\n319.\tThe Netherlands supports the creation of nuclear weapon-free zones where they are conducive to increased stability in the regions concerned. We voted for the resolutions on the establishment of such zones in the Middle East and South Asia last year [resolutions 35/147 and 35/148, respectively], and we shall do so again. We also recognize the need for a comprehensive test ban treaty and for security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States, a subject on which we have recently made a contribution in Geneva.\n320.\tFinally, do not let us forget that there are nonnuclear armaments which are threatening as well, and which call for measures of control. Among these are chemical weapons, the use of which was outlawed long ago, but which should be made to disappear altogether as soon as possible. The preparation of a treaty on chemical weapons is, to my mind, one of the major tasks of the Committee on Disarmament.\n321.\tThe record of the United Nations in the vital field of disarmament over the past 35 years has been limited, but the international community and its constituent parts must persevere in their efforts. My Government pledges its active participation.\n322.\tA comprehensive settlement of the Middle East conflict remains of critical importance to world peace. In its meeting at Venice last year, the European Council of the European Communities made clear the two principles on which such a settlement should be based 13 and its preparedness to play a role in reaching such a settlement. Lord Carrington, on behalf of the European Community, has already set out our position in regard to this conflict. I should like to stress the urgency of reaching a negotiated and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East that is just and lasting, and that provides security for all States in the area. There can be no just and lasting peace without a solution to the Palestinian problem.\n323.\tThe continued and arduous search for a settlement in the Middle East suffered another setback as renewed and violent hostilities flared up once again in Lebanon, increasing even more the sufferings of the unhappy people in that country. The subsequent ceasefire arrangement, on the other hand, constituted a step forward and proved that moderation and the conciliation of all parties concerned were possible; a full-scale confrontation was avoided in the end.\n324.\tWe continue to believe that the territorial integrity of Lebanon constitutes a prerequisite for stability in the area. The peacekeeping activities of UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, which are of paramount importance for that country's integrity, and in which the Netherlands has been participating as a troop contributing country over the last three years, continue to be hampered. I wish to reiterate our call on all parties concerned to enable UNIFIL to fulfill in safety its difficult and important mandate. We shall welcome and support any initiative in this regard. In view of the extremely difficult circumstances in which UNIFIL operates, I wish to express the high esteem of the Netherlands Government for the contingents of the United Nations and to express our deep sympathy to the Governments and peoples of Fiji, Ireland and Nigeria on the losses their contingents have suffered this year in the service of peace.\n325.\tThe continued Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan and the lack of implementation of the resolutions adopted by this Assembly on the situation in that country give the Netherlands Government cause for concern. The violation of the rule of law with regard to the self-determination and sovereignty of a people cannot be condoned. We hope that the parties involved will accept the proposals made by the European Council to bring an end to foreign military intervention and to restore the independence and nonaligned status of that stricken country. It is, in the view of the Netherlands Government, the responsibility of the international community to work for a speedy and peaceful solution and for the alleviation of the suffering of the Afghan people within and outside the borders of their country.\n326.\tThe principles of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and of refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity of any State are at the very basis of our existence as a civilized international community. These principles are embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and they are valid all over the world. They are at least as relevant to the situation in Poland as they are to Afghanistan. They have been solemnly reconfirmed in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference.\n327.\tPersistent violations of the rule of law also continue to be tragic features of the situation in southern Africa. Successive. Governments of the Netherlands have fundamentally rejected the policy of apartheid. The refusal of the Government of South Africa to abide by United Nations resolutions on apartheid and Namibia makes further pressure, including economic measures, inevitable. My country has a positive attitude towards the use of economic instruments, taking into consideration the opinion of the international community. With due regard to its international obligations, the Netherlands Government is urgently looking for the most effective way to participate in the existing voluntary oil embargo against South Africa and to institute regulations concerning* investment in South Africa and the limitation of certain imports from that country.\n328.\tThe Netherlands Government fully implements the arms embargo and discourages contacts with the South African authorities in the fields of culture, science and sport.\n329.\tWe will continue to render financial support, in particular, to the front-line States and we will work for an increase in international assistance to those States. Humanitarian assistance will be given to movements that oppose apartheid policies. Victims of apartheid policies, including political refugees, can count on our support.\n330.\tA peaceful Solution of the question of Namibia on the basis of self-determination remains an essential condition of peace in southern Africa. The continuous efforts by the Secretary-General, the group of five Western States and the front-line States in implementing the settlement proposal for Namibia approved by the Security Council by resolution 435 (1978) regrettably have not led to a solution. So far, South Africa's position, as demonstrated during the pre-implementation meeting of last January, has not permitted the achievement of this objective.\n331.\tIn recent weeks the situation in southern Africa has been further aggravated by the operations of the South African army inside the territory of Angola. The Netherlands Government condemns the military actions of the Government of South Africa, which violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola.\n332.\tChange in southern Africa has long been on the agenda of the Assembly. The margins for peaceful change have steadily narrowed, while the forces of violent change are dangerously increasing. We shall have to do our utmost to make sure that the necessary changes come about while they can still be realized in a peaceful manner.\n333.\tThe Kingdom of the Netherlands follows closely the political, economic and social developments in Central America and the Caribbean.\n334.\tLast December the General Assembly expressed its dismay about the climate of repression and violence prevailing in El Salvador and appealed for a cessation of violence and for the establishment of full respect for human rights in El Salvador [resolution 35/192]. This appeal has not been heeded. Human rights violations continue as before and are a matter of deep concern to the Government and people of the Netherlands. The people of El Salvador are entitled to determine their own future, free from outside interference, in a process of genuinely free elections. But as long as terrorism by paramilitary forces and other forms of violence continue, no free expression of the will of the people is possible.\n335.\tIt is our sincere hope that a comprehensive political settlement process will be initiated in which the representative political forces will participate. Such a settlement should lead to a new internal order creating the conditions for free elections, leading to the establishment of genuine democracy.\n336.\tWe give our support to the recent resolution of the European Parliament, directly elected by the peoples of the European Community, calling for a settlement between the Government on the one hand and the opposition Revolutionary Democratic Front on the other. The Netherlands Government feels that no effort should be spared to facilitate the rapprochement of \\\"the parties involved, with a view to ending the plight of the people of El Salvador.\n337.\tA tragic example of the apparent powerlessness of the international community is the conflict in and around Kampuchea. The continuing human drama, with its disregard for both the sovereignty and integrity of a nation and the elementary human rights and freedom of the individual, is threatening peace and stability in the area. We regret the failure to implement last year's General Assembly resolution [resolution 3516] and the Decoration of the International Conference on Kampuchea 14 held last July. My Government feels that this Assembly should consider ways and means of ensuring their implementation. We continue to support the efforts of the countries of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN] in this respect.\n338.\tThe United Nations has a central role to play in achieving the withdrawal of all foreign forces and a political solution aimed at allowing the Kampuchean people freely to decide upon their own future without outside interference. We admire the efforts of international and nongovernmental organizations to alleviate the burden of the Kampuchean people.\n339.\tI call upon all parties concerned fully to utilize the framework of the United Nations in seeking a lasting solution that would end this tragic conflict.\n340.\tThe promotion and encouragement of respect for and faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women are at the heart of the objectives of the Organization. As an organization of States, it has in essence been designed by its founding fathers as an organization of the peoples and for the peoples of the world. The same idea of solidarity with human beings everywhere constitutes a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the Netherlands. We are fully committed to the recognition of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the oppressed and the destitute in all parts of the world.\n341.\tThe promotion and protection of human rights is not the concern of Governments alone. Involvement of the people themselves has vital significance for the struggle for human rights. Many individuals play an invaluable role in this struggle, acting either on their own or in the framework of nongovernmental organizations. In many cases such organizations have taken the lead in standing up for the victims of discrimination and repression. In my view, human rights activists and human rights nongovernmental organizations are vanguards of human solidarity.\n342.\tI want to pay a tribute here to those human rights activists in many countries who are being penalized and persecuted because of their exercise of rights that have been recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association, including the right to form trade unions. Such activists have fallen victim to publication bans, to dismissal from their jobs, to internal banishment and to loss of liberty, sometimes through political trials and sometimes without any trial, for instance, by confinement to psychiatric institutions. In several cases such activists have paid with their lives for their efforts in promoting respect for human rights.\n343.\tWithin the United Nations, the work to ensure the observance of basic standards of human dignity must be carried on with vigor. In many places in the world such standards are still being trampled upon notwithstanding their explicit formulation in United Nations declarations and conventions. Several countries are afflicted with a rising tide of intolerance and group hatred, leading to the torture and physical liquidation of citizens who do not share the views of the ruling regime.\n344.\tAfter the unanimous adoption in 1975 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment [General Assembly resolution 3452(XXX), annex], it is an affront to international solidarity that torture is still being practiced today and that it is still being excused with references to exceptional circumstances, which are specifically excluded as grounds for justification in the Declaration.\n345.\tIn regent years the authorities of certain countries have turned to new methods of terror designed to help them evade their own responsibility. I am referring to the method of having political opponents simply assassinated by anonymous executioners and the method of having people abducted, equally anonymously, to secret places of detention. As to the second method, I hope that the excellent work of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances set up by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights will contribute to the stopping of that detestable practice.\n346.\tFrom my own experience in the Commission I am convinced that that body still has many important contributions to make to the achievement of a more just and a more humane world. I note with satisfaction that next year the Commission will be able to give serious attention to the rights of indigenous peoples, whose position is increasingly being imperiled by the expanding needs of modern society.\n347.\tDuring this session of the Assembly there will be an opportunity to discuss the draft optional protocol on the abolishment of capital punishment, submitted by the Federal Republic of Germany.15 My Government hopes that many delegations will be in a position to support that initiative.\n348.\tWe welcome the submission by the Economic and Social Council to the Assembly of a complete text of the draft Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief. Almost two decades have passed since the Assembly first asked for the elaboration of such a document. I urge the Assembly to adopt and proclaim that Declaration at the present session. The subject matter of the Declaration is no less relevant today than it was 20 years ago. On the contrary, it may be even more relevant nowadays. It is my deep conviction that the Organization should combat religious intolerance and discrimination as vigorously as it has combated racial intolerance and discrimination.\n349.\tThe Netherlands Government attaches fundamental importance to the continued struggle against all forms of discrimination, and strongly supports the endeavors of the United Nations in this field. In particular we regard the recent entry into force of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women [General Assembly resolution 34/180, annex] as a milestone in this struggle. It is widely felt in my country that Governments have the responsibility to devise policies aimed at the prevention and elimination of discriminatory practices in society.\n350.\tPolitical oppression, social discrimination and economic misery and exploitation are equally incompatible with intrinsic human dignity. The struggle for human rights therefore requires an integrated approach extending to social and economic as well as to civil and political relationships. In this context the discussions oh the emerging concept of the right to development are of great importance. The Netherlands delegation is determined to participate in a constructive way in the further elaboration of this concept.\n351.\tThe progressive development of international law and its codification have always been among the important tasks of the General Assembly. Over the past years the foundation has been laid for the drafting of a comprehensive convention on the law of the sea, based on the concept of a common heritage of mankind as adopted by the Assembly at its twenty-fifth session [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. The tenth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has indicated that the overwhelming majority of the world community of nations feels that a generally acceptable regime of the seas is now within reach.\n352.\tSuch a convention, scheduled to be signed next year in Caracas, will constitute a monumental achievement. The centuries old idea of the seas being open to all has been molded to the modern world reality of widely divergent capacities of States to benefit from this openness of the oceans and to' the need to protect the oceans and their resources against indiscriminate use. Effective international cooperation with full regard for the special interests of developing countries is the key for the new regime of the seas as a shared resource of all countries. Next year the international community will basically have no alternative, for the law of the sea no longer has a \\\"no treaty\\\" option.\n353.\tIn 1983 we shall commemorate the birth of my learned compatriot, Hugo Grotius, four centuries ago. He was one of the earliest advocates of the idea that the seas are the common heritage of mankind. I hope that the Convention on the Law of the Sea will be a reality when that commemoration takes place.\n354.\tThe staggering problems of mass poverty, hunger and unemployment facing the developing countries continue to command top priority on the international agenda. Over the past years, conditions have often deteriorated, particularly for the poorest countries. Recent conferences, such as the United Nations conferences on the least developed countries and on new and renewable sources of energy, have drawn the attention of the international community to specific problem areas and have indicated ways to approach the issues. Nevertheless, we, like others, are distressed by the overall lack of concrete progress towards solutions for the problems facing the developing world.\n355.\tWe are concerned to see that it has not yet been possible to reach an agreement on the new round of global negotiations, notwithstanding the general recognition of the need for those negotiations and notwithstanding the admirable and tireless efforts of the distinguished predecessor of Mr. Kittani, Mr. von Wechmar, who deserves our special gratitude. We hope that we shall soon be in a position to build on the foundation he has laid for us, and we are happy that Mr. Kittani has undertaken to continue the work in this field.\n356.\tThere seems to be a need for a bold, imaginative move to break through the present stalemate that by and large characterizes the NorthSouth negotiations. Concerted international action is required. In that context we appreciate the proposal to convene the summit meeting at Cancun focused on the NorthSouth relationship, as presented in the Brandt Commission's report.17 Such an unprecedented meeting can, and we hope will, provide the necessary impetus to unblock the NorthSouth negotiating process and, through a common understanding on broad orientations, facilitate the substantial action that is so urgently needed.\n357.\tIt is evident that the areas of food, finance and energy, in particular, need immediate action.\n358.\tAs to the food issue, the overwhelming dimensions of present and foreseeable problems provide every reason to call for stepped up efforts with regard to food production, food security and food aid. It is almost shameful to find ourselves squabbling^ over procedures and percentage shares when the urgency of the problem does not allow for further delay.\n359.\tNone of us will disagree that there is a necessity to address, in an alert and effective manner, the energy issues that confront us all. The interrelated problems of energy consumption, energy production and energy trade will figure dominantly in this and coming years. With so much to be gained all round by improving consumption patterns and increasing and diversifying supplies, it should be possible for us to step up efforts and agree on joint action.\n360.\tAn effective approach to energy problems will imply the mobilization of additional finances. In this connection I wish to reaffirm our interest in the establishment of an energy affiliate within the framework of the World Bank.\n361.\tIn the area of finance, I hardly need to restate the problem. We are all aware of the greatly increased need for financial transfers to meet acute balance of payments problems as well as longer term development needs.\n362.\tAs an expression of the continued priority given to development cooperation, and in spite of important budgetary cuts in a number of fields, the Netherlands Government has committed itself to keeping its official aid at least at the same level. At present, approximately 1 per cent of our gross national product is spent on official development assistance.\n363.\tWe have noted recent statements stressing the importance of private flows. While we agree that private flows are crucial for many developing countries, I should like to emphasize that private flows do not and cannot lessen the need for increased public transfers, without which large areas and sectors will remain bypassed or neglected.\n364.\tOur commitment to the needs of the developing countries must not falter. The question remains how best to approach the various NorthSouth issues, to some of which I have just referred.\n365.\tIt is of the highest importance that the functional approach pursued in the appropriate specialized forums should be adhered to in a manner which offers the best chance for concrete and tangible results.\n366.\tGiven the worldwide and interrelated nature of the problems at stake, there is also a need for a process of negotiations that allows for an overview which provides for overall objectives and ensures general guidance and progress within a specific timespan. The Netherlands is prepared to play an active role in such a process.\n367.\tI have touched upon a number of vital problems with which the international community is faced. At the beginning of my statement I spoke of a dangerous decade. If we are to solve the numerous and formidable problems facing us, we must use the Organization fully and effectively. We must use it to attain the purposes and principles for which it was created, and enable it to fulfill its mission as an instrument for peaceful change. Then the United Nations will be able to take up the challenge of the 1980s to improve the cooperative and decision-making capacity of the international community, and to meet the needs of future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.This session takes place at an important moment in international affairs. I believe you will ensure that it achieves significant and lasting results. I also join in the tributes to the contribution of the outgoing President, Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the work of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n216.\tI should also like to join other speakers in welcoming Vanuatu, a Pacific partner and fellow Commonwealth member, as a Member of this Organization. I had the good fortune to pay a visit to Vila in August, when Vanuatu hosted the South Pacific Forum.\n217.\tAustralia's relationships with its Pacific neighbors continue to expand. So too do our relationships with other neighboring countries in South and South-East Asia. Indeed, Australia is perhaps unique among the developed countries, being in a region otherwise populated by countries in and of the third world which brings me to the main theme of this statement, the NorthSouth dialog.\n218.\tI am aware, of course, of the vast range of issues before this Assembly, many of which demand our immediate and earnest consideration. In the coming weeks our delegation will be making Australia's attitude on these issues known. However, today I will concentrate on the NorthSouth dialog. We have reached an. important stage in relations between developed and developing countries and we must be prepared to make genuine progress.\n219.\tAustralia would welcome progress. We do not seek change simply for its own sake. Our belief in the need for change stems from our conviction that new attitudes and new arrangements and, above all, a new commitment are needed to tackle the most fundamental problems of the present international economic system. We believe that merely preserving the status quo is not enough and that all nations will gain from a growing and more integrated world economy.\n220.\tOver the last seven years a number of significant declarations have been made under the auspices of the United Nations. Many of these resolutions are landmarks in the search for a new basis for international cooperation. Unfortunately, we have so far found it very difficult to put the spirit of them into practice. Rhetoric, conflict and division have characterized debate over NorthSouth issues. Nevertheless, there have been some encouraging developments notably the agreement to set up the Common Fund for Commodities and the creation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The need to manage the growing interdependence of States demands that we do much more.\n221.\tIf the NorthSouth dialog is managed effectively and in a spirit of cooperation and compromise the international economic system will be able to make necessary and equitable adjustments. We can avoid serious disruptions, which would be damaging for developed and developing countries alike.\n222.\tTo do that we need to understand the consequences of greater interdependence. Recognition of interdependence is essential, not only for prosperity, but also for longterm peace and security. Nations cannot put up the shutters and attempt to live in self-imposed isolation. We must respond not only to the demands of our own national communities but to those of the world as a whole.\n223.\tIn approaching the NorthSouth dialog, we must concentrate on its essential elements. Over time, procedures and agreements will have to be devised which generate benefits for us all, not in equal measure perhaps, and certainly more for the most disadvantaged, but nevertheless benefits for us all.\n224.\tIn Australia's view, genuine progress in North South questions will only be achieved if we acknowledge fully some of the realities of the international economy. We should recognize that the major industrialized countries of the North will be asked to carry the biggest share of the burden. Those economies generate the vast majority of the world's wealth and clearly, any setbacks they suffer will be felt far beyond their own borders. The fact is that the prospects for the peoples of the world's less developed nations hinge largely on the economic fortunes of those motor economies. In looking at how progress can be made in the NorthSouth dialog, we must not lose sight of the stake all nations have in a strong and dynamic international economic system.\n225.\tAustralia's recent economic performance is in contrast to that of most of the other industrialized nations. We have made real progress in fighting some of the most intractable economic problems. I suggest it is worthwhile to examine how we have done it. In mentioning Australia's distinctive economic performance, I am aware that within the market economies different economic strategies will have to be used, as appropriate, to produce the results both North and South are looking for. Over the last decade Australia has used two strategies, with very different results.\n226.\tWe initially looked to government to provide the solution to our economic problems, in the expectation that government could provide a comprehensive shelter from the harsh economic realities of the times. Rapid growth of government spending and relaxation of restraints on the money supply were translated directly into unacceptably high levels of inflation. The damage to employment and investment was immediate and severs.\n227.\tWe subsequently chose the alternative of fighting inflation as a first priority, restricting government spending, cutting back government deficits and making careful use of monetary policy. That strategy has resulted in a significant reduction in inflation and unemployment, higher rates of growth and a greater inflow of the overseas capital so vital to the development of our national resources.\n228.\tBut Australia recognizes that for progress to be made in the NorthSouth dialog industrialized nations must do more than simply use whatever strategies they see fit to put their own houses in order. Those nations, whose participation will be vital to the success of any global round of negotiations, must be persuaded that on balance their domestic and external interests can be pie served and indeed furthered. If we cannot do that we shall find, even though the negotiations may begin, that the process will constantly be placed in jeopardy because the expectations exceed the results that are politically possible or economically feasible. If the process of global negotiations is to be resumed in the most promising context we should all carefully review our demands and expectations, in terms not only of what can be achieved but also of the timescale which might be necessary. We must devise proposals and procedures which will enable all nations and groups to make the maximum contributions within the realistic limits of their politics and capabilities.\n229.\tIn event, Governments alone cannot create the climate of international prosperity which will be necessary if we are to achieve the goals of the NorthSouth dialog. The potential contribution of the private sector must be recognized and it must be given the opportunity to participate. We are sure that the global negotiations process, conducted in a multilateral framework, will be able to provide a role for the private sector. Our approach to global negotiations must embrace all aspects of economic endeavor.\n230.\tThe problems of a difficult world economic situation have not prevented the efforts of member countries to get NorthSouth cooperation moving again. Recent meetings in Caracas, Ottawa, Nairobi, Cancun and Paris have held out some prospect of progress.\n231.\tIn a few days time there will be an opportunity to review the state of NorthSouth relations when the biennial meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government takes place in Australia. I am aware that nonCommonwealth Members of the General Assembly may not be fully aware of the role and function of the Commonwealth.\n232.\tThe notion of the Commonwealth as a colonial relic has now been well and truly dispelled. The modem Commonwealth has been responsive to the needs and aspirations of its members. Moreover, it has made several important contributions to the international community, including arrangements for majority rule in Zimbabwe and support for establishment of the Common Bind.\n233.\tThe Commonwealth has some distinct advantages as a forum for the consideration of NorthSouth issues. Over a quarter of the States represented here today are members of the Commonwealth. It includes major industrialized States, newly industrializing States, least developed countries, island developing States and oil-exporting developing States. Its frank and informal way of working has helped build consensus among its members,\n234.\tThe Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will be considering many of the subjects before this Assembly. It will take up the questions of decolonization and racism in Africa, particularly as they relate to Namibia and South Africa; the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea; arms control and disarmament; the Indian Ocean; human rights; and the law of the sea. Nevertheless, a principal focus of the meeting will be the present state of NorthSouth relations. Discussions with participating Heads of Government have indicated that special attention will be given to food and food security, trade and industrialization, international Financial questions and energy.\n235.\tCommonwealth leaders will have the opportunity to examine those matters at that meeting, which comes shortly before the NorthSouth summit meeting to be held in Mexico in October. They have indicated that they wish to do so, and I am confident that the results of that review will make a positive contribution to the work of nations attending the meeting in Cancun and to the work of this Assembly.\n\n236.\tSeven Heads of Government who will be in Melbourne will go to Cancun. My Government hopes they will be able to carry a clear and unequivocal message from the whole membership of the Commonwealth that there should be new progress in NorthSouth relations and that at this session the General Assembly should resume efforts to achieve an effective framework for the global negotiations.\n237.\tI should now like to make some specific comments on the principal issues on the NorthSouth agenda.\n238.\tOne of the most pressing problems facing the developing countries is food production and food security. Clearly, the only longterm solution lies in the developing countries increasing their own production, through increased investment in agriculture and the adoption of appropriate national food strategies.\n239.\tThere is also a need for international measures which will assist world food security in both the short and long terms. Australia has consistently supported such measures. They include increased food grain aid commitments to meet the World Food Conference target of 10 million tonnes per year and a concerted effort to reach agreement on the replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. I also believe that a significant contribution could be made to world food security by the negotiation of an international grain agreement, with economic provisions which would safeguard the common interests of both exporting and importing countries while recognizing the special needs of developing countries.\n240.\tIn recognition of the continuing need of developing countries, Australia recently announced a number of initiatives relating to food security. Those include an increase in food aid to over $US 120 million this financial year and the establishment of an Australian center for International Agricultural Research. The principal aim of the center will be to contribute to the solution of agricultural problems in developing countries. A trust fund will be established for the center with an initial commitment of $US 28 million over four years.\n241.\tThe general situation in world trade is particularly difficult. Economic difficulties in the major world economies have gone hand in hand with mounting protectionist pressures. Some form of protection is now applied to almost 30 per cent of world trade.\n242.\tThe developing countries are having an increasing impact on world trade. Their exports continue to increase more rapidly than the world average and they are the fastest growing importers of the products of the major industrialized countries.\n243.\tIncreased opportunities for trade offer the most effective means to bring greater prosperity to the developing countries. However, the prospect of increased protectionism, when coupled with the significant deterioration in the terms of trade of non-oil developing countries as a group, means that the outlook of those countries is increasingly uncertain.\n244.\tDespite the achievements of the last global round, the multilateral trade negotiations still left the developing countries facing higher levels of protection than the industrialized countries. The position has continued to deteriorate, with the major industrialized countries introducing further protectionist measures. Moreover, the fact that many of these measures are not introduced through the conventional institutional framework means that the developing countries are unable to challenge their introduction or to seek redress where they are treated inequitably.\n245.\tThere is another angle to all this. To the extent that both the North and the South stand to benefit from improved world economic conditions and higher levels of NorthSouth trade, it can be shown that the participants in NorthSouth dialog are not necessarily participants in a \\\"zero-sum game\\\". There does not have to be a winner and a loser. The gains from higher levels of trade are shared by both importer and exporter, by both North and South. That is an aspect which could be given more attention than it has in the past.\n246.\tThere is an urgent need for international bodies to consider ways and means of better accommodating developing countries within the international trading system. Both the global negotiations, when they take place, and the forthcoming GATT meeting of trade ministers should address that issue.\n247.\tImportant contributions can also be made in the field of commodities. Commodity trade is fundamental to the wellbeing of the developing countries and price stabilization alone will not provide the means to greater prosperity. There is only limited scope for the introduction of buffer stock finance schemes and these are not appropriate for all commodities. Other aspects of the UNCTAD Integrated Program for Commodities must be seriously, explored. In that context special attention should be given to the scope for increasing commodity processing within commodity-exporting countries.\n248.\tWe are all aware of the severe problems of higher energy prices for non-oil producing developing countries. Although national Governments themselves must introduce energy policies aimed at encouraging conservation, conversion and development of new resources, the international community again can play an important part.\n249.\tThe United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held in Nairobi, was able to demonstrate that the United Nations could make a positive contribution to the discussion of energy matters. It also highlighted some of the special problems of developing countries, including the supply of the most ancient of energy sources fuel wood. The international community must address these critical problems, while not neglecting the needs of all countries for conventional fuels. Measures to implement the Program of Action adopted by the Conference must now be taken. For its part, Australia has agreed to support financial proposals from that Program.\n250.\tAustralia supports the establishment of the proposed World Bank energy affiliate to develop new sources of oil supply and to promote the use of alternative energy sources. However, greater lending for those purposes should not be delayed until some new body is established. We therefore welcome the recent increase in energy lending by the World Bank.\n\n251.\tThe debt situation for many countries now imposes a severe burden. High energy costs, inflation, steep in\ncreases in interest rates and changing exchange rates have all had their impact. Debt management problems appear to be particularly harsh for those developing countries which are at the two extremes: those which are going through a process of dynamic growth face difficulties in financing that growth, while the low-income countries are having difficulty in paying for imports, particularly energy.\n252.\tAustralia welcomes the response so far by IMF to these difficult problems which confront the developing countries. The IMF has shown flexibility in its approach and has made an important contribution to the recycling process. Australia supports soundly based improvements in the Fund which will benefit developing countries. The new enlarged access to the Fund's resources, the establishment of a food facility and an interest subsidy account are innovative and important developments.\n253.\tThere remains a need for the Fund to continue to adapt its activities to changing circumstances. Australia would support increased IMF capacity to assist the financing and adjustment of large financial deficits and in that context welcomes the recently concluded borrowing agreements to assist in ensuring that adequate resources are made available to countries in balance of payments difficulties.\n254.\tAustralia recognizes the importance of industrialization for the developing countries. Industrialization provides the main avenue for achieving rapid economic growth, improved employment opportunities and higher standards of living. Sound, practical economic measures, tailored to the resource endowments and capabilities of each country, are necessary. Recent years have seen progress in those areas, with contributions from UNIDO and the regional commissions and the development banks.\n255.\tAustralia is also concerned with the related problems of protection and structural adjustment. These raise complex issues for all countries and Australia is no exception though on a per capita basis we are already a major importer of manufactured goods from developing countries. The Australian Government has recently commissioned an independent inquiry into our domestic tariff arrangements. The objective of that inquiry, which is to be completed within six months, is to identify possible measures for further general reductions in longterm protection levels.\n256.\tOfficial development assistance remains an important instrument for growth. It is particularly effective when provided in support of domestic efforts and policies designed to promote self-reliant development.\n257.\tAustralia has recently increased its aid program substantially to just under three quarters of a billion United States dollars in the current Australian financial year. The increase planned for the present financial year of more than $US 110 million is evidence of our acceptance of official development assistance as a key element in the NorthSouth dialog. It will allow us to undertake various important new practical initiatives in the main areas of NorthSouth discussion, such as food, energy and international finance.\n258.\tThe outcome of the recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries recently held in\nParis is a significant and positive step in relations between developed and developing nations. The action it has proposed will help to ease the problems of the poorer countries. Australia is one of the few donors actually located among developing nations and its aid priorities reflect its regional links and associations in the South Pacific and in north and south Asia. Australia has, however, more than doubled its assistance to the least developed countries over the period 1978 to 1981.\n259.\tIn the coming year we shall be increasing our contributions to UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF. Similar substantial increases are programmed in our contributions to UNHCR and UNRWA. Australia ranked ninth among the countries to announce contributions at the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa held earlier this year. Our food aid allocations are increasingly being directed to the famine and emergency situations which have arisen in Africa.\n260.\tAustralia, with other developed countries, supported the principle of economic cooperation among developing countries at the fifth session of UNCTAD in 1979. We welcome the potential identified by the Caracas SouthSouth meeting last May for practical cooperation among developing countries in a wide range of economic areas. We are hopeful that SouthSouth cooperation will develop in a way which is complementary to the achievement of improved relations between North and South.\n261.\tI wish to refer also to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which is drafting a legal regime to cover the resources of the oceans. The international community has worked in close cooperation for almost a decade to finalize that new legal regime, which places great emphasis on equity and international resource sharing. It is my Government's sincere hope that next year a convention on the law of the sea, enjoying widespread support, may be opened for signature. I believe that would be a major demonstration of what may be achieved by cooperation between developed and developing countries.\n262.\tI have today focused attention on Australia's interests in the achievement of progress in the NorthSouth dialog. We must not lose the opportunity we have this year to make a historic contribution to progress in North South questions. Let us hope that the summit meeting of Heads of Government in Cancun and the Commonwealth meeting will be able to provide a new momentum and a new commitment to the progress towards an effective global dialog. Let us also recognize that a global round, to be effective, must allow for the participation of all interested countries. All Member States must be persuaded that their interests will be protected and that they will have the opportunity to contribute in a real way to the process of negotiation. The United Nations must have a major role in the process.\n263.\tThe world community has only one universal body, the United Nations. The Organization has its limitations. It has its shortcomings. But we will have to work within its framework and capitalize on its possibilities if we are to achieve a fundamental and long-lasting reconciliation of the interests of developed and developing countries.\n"

        "file_text": "234. Sir, I extend to you my delegation's warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that with your enormous experience and your well-known diplomatic skills, the Assembly will be able to discharge its responsibilities with wisdom and efficiency.\n235.\tMay I also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, of the Federal Republic of Germany, for the outstanding leadership he gave the Assembly during both the thirty-fifth session and the eighth emergency special session. We wish him all success and happiness in future endeavors.\n236.\tI also wish to take this Opportunity to pay tribute to our SecretaryGeneral for his dedication to the service of the United Nations.\n237.\tIt is with much pleasure that my delegation welcomes into our midst Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu as new Members of the United Nations.\n238.\tUganda reaffirms its unequivocal commitment to the realization of self-determination and independence for all peoples who are still under colonial domination. In this regard, we welcome the recent step taken by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity towards constructing a framework for a just and peaceful solution to the question of Western Sahara [see AI36I534, annex II, AHG/Res.103 (XVIII)]. We appeal to the parties to the conflict to give full cooperation to the oAU Implementation Committee in order to ensure that the efforts of Africa are rewarded with a genuine and speedy exercise of self-determination by the people of Western Sahara.\n239.\tOne of the most important items on the agenda of the thirty-fifth session was that on the launching of global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development [item 123], an endeavor aimed at correcting the present structural imbalances in the world economy. The international community has placed its hopes in the General Assembly for a positive move towards this objective. It is thus with a sense of frustration and disappointment that we observed the Assembly's failure to launch the global round.\n240.\tOur frustration is all the more profound because this issue has been under discussion for a very long time. Indeed, the eleventh special session was devoted exclusively to it. Yet to this day no agreement has been reached on the framework and procedures for negotiations.\n241.\tIt is the view of my delegation that discussions on such substantial issues as the reform of the international monetary and financial institutions, transfer of resources, raw materials, commodities and energy are long overdue. We appeal to the Western countries which are still holding out to rethink their positions and join the consensus. It is our strong hope that the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held at Cancun will serve to open new avenues of understanding that will lead\nrapidly to the commencement of global negotiations. \n242.\tContrary to the impression that is sometimes given, the new international economic order is not simply about some massive transfer of resources from North to South without any benefits accruing to the industrialized countries. Clearly, the countries of the North and the countries of the South have many common interests in the long run, much more perhaps than some countries are now willing to acknowledge. This sense of global interdependence and mutual benefits was well expressed by the Brandt Commission in its report:\n\\\"... all nations will benefit from a strengthened global economy, reduced inflation and an improved climate for growth and investment. All nations will benefit from better management of the world's finite resources (and from stabilization of the world's population). All nations industrialized and developing . . . have a clear interest in greater security, and in improved political capability and leadership to manage global problems.\\\"10\nThus the restructuring of the world economy serves the longterm interests of both the industrialized and developing nations.\n243.\tUganda commends the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris, for recognizing the special mature of problems faced by this group of countries and for unanimously adopting the Substantial New Program of Action.6 It is our hope that there will be a speedy and successful implementation of this Program and that it will not suffer the same fate as the Immediate Program of Action which preceded it.\n244.\tWith regard to official development aid, we appeal to those countries which have not yet attained the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to endeavor to do so. We commend those countries that have fulfilled their commitment in this respect.\n245.\tInternational measures for assistance are meant to be supportive of, and cannot be substitutes for, efforts by the developing countries themselves. The primary impulse for development, as all our countries recognize, must come from ourselves. In this regard, we can maximize our development through economic cooperation among developing countries. Uganda and its neighbors, for their part, have taken the initiative in strengthening regional cooperation in the area of eastern Africa in all spheres.\n246.\tThe sharp rise in the cost of energy in recent years has underlined the urgent need to expand and diversify our present energy supply and move from the present international economy, which is heavily dependent on hydrocarbons, to one increasingly based on new and renewable sources of energy.\n\n247.\tWhile we welcomed the compromise reached in the Nairobi Program of Action,' we were disappointed at the lack of agreement on specific financial targets and mechanisms for mobilization of funds for the development of now and renewable sources of energy. We hope this Program will receive the necessary international support for mobilization of finance and the transfer of technology to developing countries.\n248.\tThe Government of Uganda attaches great importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We have viewed with great concern the decision taken in March this year by the United States to review the entire draft convention, the text of which is the outcome of 10 years of arduous negotiations and compromises. The present text is by no means satisfactory to my delegation, but we accept it as a reasonable compromise in the circumstances. In this connection, my delegation welcomes the recent decision of the Conference to transform the informal negotiating text into a draft convention. A speedy and successful conclusion of the Conference on the Law of the Sea would be a worthy credit to the efforts of the United Nations and a contribution to bridging the gap between North and South.\n249.\tAnother issue which has widened the gap between North and South is the question of the flow and dissemination of information. Uganda welcomes the International Program for the Development of Communication approved by UNESCO at Belgrade in 1980.\\\" For us in the third world, the quest for a new international information order forms an integral part of the overall framework of the new international economic order. The political, economic, social and cultural development of our communities is inevitably hampered by our lack of participation in the field of information dissemination. The near monopoly of mass-media communication sustained by the industrialized countries perpetuates such imbalance in the flow of information as to deny us the opportunity for adequate self-exposition, both internally and internationally.\n250.\tOur desire to restructure this imbalance should in no way be misconstrued as an attempt to undermine the principle of freedom of the press. On the contrary, our action is prompted by a concern to universalize that freedom.\n251.\tThe year 1981 has witnessed a general deterioration in the international political situation. Events in most regions of the world, particularly in the existing areas of conflict, have dimmed our hopes for greater peace and security. We have this year experienced increased human affliction caused by senseless acts of aggression and continued warfare. We have also experienced heightened tension caused by a deplorable return to the vicious arms race between West and East.\n252.\tIn our own region, Africa, 1981 has turned out to be not only a year of broken promises, but also one of great frustration. We have seen a more emboldened and belligerent South Africa consolidate its oppression in Namibia and in South Africa itself while committing massive aggression against the front-line States.\n253.\tLast year and at the beginning of this year, we had all hoped that 1981 would be the year for Namibian independence. Instead of progress towards independence, we have experienced a record of setbacks and a painful period of benign neglect. In January, we witnessed the collapse of the pre-implementation meeting held at Geneva. That meeting was supposed to be the last step before the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations plan for Namibia which the Council endorsed by that resolution. But South Africa, with characteristic bad faith, deliberately wrecked the talks.\n254.\tConsequent upon that failure, a global consensus emerged in favor of the Security Council's applying enforcement measures against South Africa under Chapter VIJ of the Charter in order to compel the racist regime to comply with the United Nations plan. However, this global consensus suffered a rebuff last April when the three Western permanent members of the Security Council vetoed the proposed measures.\n255.\tSince last January, the Western contact group has been urging us to be patient and to await the results of their various consultations. We were even made to believe that they would have some concrete proposals by the time of the emergency special session. But to this day nothing substantial has emerged.\n256.\tInstead of movement towards the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), there has been an inordinate preoccupation with strengthening, that resolution and protecting minority rights. My delegation is disturbed that these peripheral concerns should postpone the attainment of freedom for the overwhelming majority of Namibians, who continue to suffer untold indignities under the most vicious machinery of colonial occupation.\n257.\tThere have been some unfortunate attempts to cast the problem of Namibia in the mold of EastWest rivalry and global strategic considerations. We wish to emphasize that the problem of Namibia remains fundamentally a colonial issue. To present the issue otherwise is to justify the illegal colonial occupation and the continued atrocities being committed against the people of Namibia.\n258.\tWe must state clearly here that the five Western States bear collective responsibility for the continued suffering of the people of Namibia. They have a moral and political obligation to compel South Africa to comply with the United Nations plan for Namibia without further delay. In this connection, it must be emphasized that resolution 435 (1978), which is a compromise document produced by the five Western States and accepted by the parties to the conflict, is the only basis for a peaceful settlement in Namibia.\n259.\tThere is an urgent need for immediate action to bring about an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia. The consequences of any further delay are too grave to contemplate. South Africa is already taking full advantage of the increased EastWest tension, as well as the equivocation of the five Western States.\n260.\tThe machinery of oppression in Namibia has become more vicious. The Territory of Namibia is being used as a springboard to launch unceasing acts of aggression against neighboring African States. Only a few weeks ago, the People's Republic of Angola suffered a massive invasion by South Africa. That invasion continues today, with the racist troops occupying a portion of the southern part of Angola. The scale and nature of this latest invasion have marked a new and more ominous stage in the conflict in southern Africa.\n261.\tIt is clear that a major objective of the Pretoria regime is to create a Lebanon situation in southern Africa. In this sinister scheme, South Africa would play the role of Israel; the puppet renegade Jonas Savimbi would play the role of Major Saad Haddad; and the southern part of Angola would become the new south Lebanon. This scheme would provide a free hunting ground for 'the South Africans, a buffer zone from which they could permanently undermine the political and economic stability of Angola. It would also provide a corridor through which the racist forces could attempt to destroy SWAPO militants and Namibian refugees in general.\n262.\tWill the international community stand idly by while South Africa is creating a Lebanon situation in southern Africa?\n263.\tWithin South Africa itself, the abominable system of apartheid is strengthening its machinery of oppression. The policy of bantustanization is being pursued with increasing ruthlessness. The forcible deportation of blacks from the urban centers to barren and over populated reserves is being carried out with cynical resolve. Several freedom fighters have recently been sentenced to death for acts of resistance against apartheid, and many more are in gaol and detention camps. Clearly, the persecutor is now so terrified of his victim that he wants to silence him for ever.\n264.\tBut this escalation of the machinery of oppression has not silenced the voices of resistance. On the contrary, it has strengthened the resolve of the oppressed. The recent attacks on selected institutional symbols of apartheid are sufficient testimony to the determination of people of South Africa to continue the struggle by all necessary means.\n265.\tIn the landscape of southern Africa, there is no fence on which to sit, and there is no middle ground.for equivocation. The choice in southern Africa is between the forces of oppression and racism and the forces of freedom and dignity. To speak of neutrality is to add a voice in support of the system of apartheid. We commend the front-line States which, against formidable odds, have maintained a steadfast commitment to the cause of justice and freedom in southern Africa. I wish to reaffirm the total solidarity and unflinching support of the Government and people of Uganda for the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia and for the front-line States.\n266.\tIn considering the increase in world tension, we are struck by the unhappy developments in the Middle East. Just as ideological and military collaboration has strengthened South Africa's hand in Africa, so also has the same collaboration strengthened Israel in its sanguinary arrogance in the Middle East. This has enabled Israel to commit acts of unprovoked armed aggression against Arab countries.\n267.\tLast June, in an unprecedented incursion, the Israeli air force attacked and destroyed Iraq's nuclear research facility. In July, the Israeli air force carried out intensive bombardments of civilian targets in Beirut, causing massive destruction of lives and property. In all these incidents Israel invoked the doctrine of self-defense, in the absence of any prior provocations or attacks. Uganda strongly condemns these acts of aggression by Israel.\n268.\tMeanwhile, in the occupied areas of the West Bank, Israel has unleashed a policy of harassment and deportation of political leaders, detention and torture of detainees, indiscriminate destruction of homes, collective punishment and expropriation of Palestinian lands. Uganda has consistently maintained that a durable peace in the Middle East is possible only if certain principles basic to the solution of the problem are recognized.\n269.\tThese principles are: the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people in its homeland without any external interference; the right of the Palestinians to national independence and sovereignty in a State of their own; the right of the displaced and dispossessed Palestinians to return to their homes, coupled with a guarantee of prompt and adequate compensation for those who may choose not to return; the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories; and the restoration of the city of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty and the preservation of its historic and religious character. Since the Palestinian question is at the core of the Middle East problem, it is imperative that any initiative for a solution involve the full participation of the PLQ, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n270.\tWhatever imperfections the system of detente contained, it was itself a landmark in the easing of world tension. It focused attention on areas of cooperation, the need to resolve conflicts through negotiations and the need for a reduction in armaments. Above all, it focused on the need to avoid a nuclear holocaust. Today, however, the world is experiencing a fateful relapse from detente into a race between East and West for armed supremacy. This has manifested itself in terms of increased military spending and the development of new weapons, on the one hand, and the replacement of negotiations between the superPowers by verbal rhetoric exchanged through the news media, on the other.\n271.\tThe impact of this development has been an increase in world tension, with the superPowers vying for spheres of influence. This has led to what is now called \\\"the global view of all conflicts\\\". What is not realized by those who take this global view of all conflicts is the fact that the peoples of Africa, Latin America and Asia have their own interests which they seek to protect and consolidate. In this regard, Uganda has followed with concern the recent developments in Central America. In particular, we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of the people of El Salvador. These people must be allowed freely to determine their own destiny within a democratic political framework.\n272.\tIn a world threatened by the forces of domination and exploitation, those who seek freedom and dignity must stand firmly together. Today, more than ever before, it is imperative that the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America strengthen their solidarity. In that solidarity lies our hope for collective survival, and it is to the cause of that solidarity that the Government and people of Uganda wish to renew their commitment today.\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all permit me to express to the President, on behalf of the Government of Cape. Verde, our heartfelt congratulations on his election to preside over the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It Is a pleasure for us to see the representative of a country with which Cape Verde has excellent relations of co-operation and friendship assuming \\\"such an Important responsibility. The growing role his country has been playing in the world, as well as within its region, and within the non-aligned movement, confers special importance upon his presidency. His vast experience and recognized talents as a statesman and diplomat make him particularly qualified for the important mission with which he has been entrusted, and we are convinced that under his guidance this session of the General Assembly will accomplish useful work in the furtherance of peace, security and the development of nations.\n204.\tWe wish to express to his predecessor, Mc Rudiger von Wechmar, our appreciation for the manner in which he carried out the difficult task of guiding the proceedings of the thirty-fifth session of the Assembly in the present international political and economic situation.\n205.\tWe should like also to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his dedication in the service of the Organization.\n206.\tIt is with great pleasure that we welcome the Republic of Vanuatu as a Member of the United Nations. Our sincere congratulations go also to Belize on the success of the struggle of its people for national independence and on its admission as a fully fledged Member of the Organization.\n207.\tIn order to contribute in a positive way to our collective thinking on the world situation today, we should like once again to point out the importance of the message that so many countries attempted to bring to the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which concluded its work at Paris two weeks ago. Peace and development should be envisaged globally as complementing each other and as inseparable from the vast task that confronts the Organization: to develop friendly relations among nations on the basis of respect and co-operation. We believe that the time has come to face the fact that economic interests have throughout the years been the origin of wars and that what we today call progress and development have flourished on domination and oppression.\n208.\tThe United Nations since its establishment has set forth principles which should serve to guarantee peace. However, these principles have proved ineffective in the face of a system of world relations in which peace rested on the subjection of the vast majority of peoples to a few powerful States. This peace, defined simply as the absence of war between major Powers did not guarantee the exercise of the right of all peoples to freedom, progress and development. This situation caused a proliferation of deadly, though localized, conflicts manifesting the determination of the peoples of what is called the third world to struggle against the established system, to resist exploitation and to determine their own economic, social and political history. In the past 30 years we have witnessed failure In regard to peace and development, while the peoples of the third world had, in order to win their right to development, to fight against a system based on values according to which the wealth of some constituted an obstacle to the solution of the problems of the majority.\n209.\tToday we see that the persistent efforts of the greater part of the international community have been beneficial, thus improving the credibility of the United Nations. As a result of the right of peoples to choose then-own destiny and the right of all nations to progress and development have become cornerstones of the new international law, in opposition to colonialism, expansionism, the right of the strong and vain efforts to stifle by force of arms or by economic or political pressures the legitimate aspirations of nations. Therefore, there has been a positive evolution whose elements must be preserved and developed.\n210.\tUniversalization of and respect for the validity of these rights, their recognition and their application by all States regardless of their strength, their size or their wealth, will give credibility and political content to the principle of peaceful coexistence, the basis and profound hope of the United Nations, and will permit social progress and the establishment of better living conditions for all peoples.\n211.\tThe Government of Cape Verde, in keeping with that development, has based its foreign policy on defence of the basic principles of non-alignment, in particular self-determination and independence, non-interference and the establishment of a new and more just and equitable International order. Support for national independence struggles, refusal to participate in military blocs and the establishment of relations of friendship and co-operation with States have been the essential pillars of our foreign policy.\n212.\tWe consider that the strengthening of detente and of peaceful coexistence, combined with the global development effort, is a decisive factor for collective world security. We therefore associate ourselves with the struggle waged by the non-aligned countries in this connection, and we believe that the progressive transformation of the principles proclaimed by the United Nations into solidly established political realism should be the responsibility and duty of all States represented here.\\\"\n213.\tNone the less we have witnessed with concern the revival of tensions, the renewal of the arms race, the resurgence of policies of confrontation, and the wide-ranging declared support for regimes considered by the international community to be criminal. In Africa this policy has profoundly violated the legitimate aspirations of our peoples, because it has led to overt support for the political positions of the apartheid regime.\n214.\tIn Africa, the complete decolonization of' the continent still remains beyond reach because of the retrogressive forces working together to maintain the. status quo against the tide of history. None the less, here and there encouraging signs have emerged, and there remains a hope that lasting solutions to existing situations may be found. Such solutions must be sought by the international community steadfastly, and with renewed political will, putting an end to delaying tactics and the policy, of force, which are doomed to failure.\n215.\tThe question of Namibia has over the years, but above all since the independence of Zimbabwe, become one of the most important questions at the African as well as the international level. In fact, because of the threats it poses to international peace and security, and because of the fact that in it converge the basic aspirations of peoples that cherish peace, dignity and freedom, the question of Namibia has today become one of the nerve centres of International relations. In this connection, it is regrettable to note that, despite declarations of good intent and the extensive efforts made by the international community to achieve the rapid independence of that \\\"territory, there is still a dangerous marking of time even a regression while the untold suffering of the Namibian people, is senselessly prolonged.\n216.\tThe plan approved by the United Nations is the framework for the historic role of the contact group, which should, particularly after the failure of the Geneva Conference caused by South Africa's intransigence and maneuvers, redouble Us efforts and use every means available to it to induce the racist regime to comply with the demands of the United Nations and, in particular, to enter immediately into serious negotiations with SWAPO. The contact group should take account, In its contacts with South Africa, of the firm position expressed by the African Stales during the Assembly of Heads of Sue and Government of the Organization of African Unity held it Nairobi last June, at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at New Delhi last February, in favour of the immediate, unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)..\n217.\tIn this context, and in the face of South Africa's intransigence, measures of material and financial assistance for SWAPO, the sole, legitimate representative of the Namibian people, are needed to help it in its struggle for Namibia's independence. There can be no doubt that the policy followed by South Africa both towards Namibia and the neighbouring countries Is a constant and daily more pronounced danger to international peace and security, and that only firm and concerted action on the part of the entire international community will lead to decisive progress towards a just and lasting solution in southern Africa.\n218.\tNor can there be any doubt either that the acts of aggression committed against Angola are a sufficient example of the harmful consequences of that, policy, and that it is Angola's will for Independence, firm anti-colonialist and anti-Imperialist determination and consistent action in support of the struggle for the independence of\n, the peoples of southern Africa -a struggle waged in fulfill point of the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations - which has brought down upon Angola the hatred of all those who thought they could perpetuate the shameful exploitation of Africans in that part of our continent.\n219.\tThe recent act of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola is an example of the Pretoria regime's intention hot only to thwart any process for a negotiated settlement leading to the genuine independence of Namibia, but .also to promote the continued destabilization of those African States which oppose its neo-colonialist designs.\n220.\tThe scope of South Africa's act of aggression and of the forces deployed, the magnitude of the destruction, as well as the prolonged occupation of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola, all constitute a source of profound concern because of the manifest intentions of the Pretoria regime to Impose in a sovereign State a puppet organization supported and armed by it, by treating there conditions conducive to its subversive activities in an obvious attempt to undermine the unity of Angola.\n221.\tUnacceptable in law, this dangerous action by South Africa must be combated most forcefully, as it is not only a negation of the principles that guide the Organization, but it also violates the essential rules governing the community.\n222.\tThe Republic of Cape Verde is pleased at the initiatives already taken by certain countries to help Angola, and wishes to reaffirm here its staunch solidarity with the heroic people of Angola, its Government and the MPLA\u2014the Worker's Party -and solemnly appeals to the international community to come to the aid of the People's Republic of Angola in Its struggle and thus guarantee its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Angolan Government is also entitled to demand compensation for the damages caused by the racist act of aggression. It is inadmissible that an aggressor regime can destroy with impunity the fruits of the labor of the Angolan people and spread death among its children.\n223.\tWe believe, moreover, that the material financial assistance given to the front-line countries by the international community should be increased substantially and supplemented by a firm guarantee of the security of the countries concerned in an unequivocal demonstration of solidarity and as testimony to a clear condemnation of the policy followed by the racist regime in that region.\n224.\tThe question of apartheid is the subject each year of a large number of resolutions of the Organization, but we have seen no substantial change in the nature of the racist regime. However, the many different kinds of struggle that have been developing more and more strongly, day by day, against the racist regime show that the peoples of South'Africa as a whole know where their genuine interests lie and are gradually discovering, the means of making them prevail, under the direction of the national liberation movement.\n225.\tMoreover; at the international level initiatives have constantly been taken by the majority of members of the international community to increase the isolation of the South African regime. While that regime is the object of unanimous condemnation by the international community because of its reactionary policy of apartheid, and while it intensifies its policy of Intimidation and aggression against States Members of the Organization, it is to us a matter of regret and of deep concern that today South Africa is finding even more allies prepared to help it and to support its initiatives.\n226.\tThe support at present enjoyed by the racist regime encourages its intransigence in the search for a negotiated solution to the question of Namibia and encourages it in its stated intentions of perpetuating apartheid, and deStabilizing the southern part of the , continent.,\n227.\tIt is to be hoped that those who still give different kinds of assistance to South Africa, claiming thus to restore a certain credibility to it on the international scene, will realize the inevitability of the downfall of that regime and will restore links of trust with African States in time and demonstrate their commitment to an Africa freed of racism and of the yoke of colonialism.\n228.\tThe situation with regard to Western Sahara developed considerably during the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Nairobi, with the acceptance by Morocco of a referendum on self-determination, promoting the beginning of a process which the whole of Africa hopes will.be successful, in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the Sahraoui people, to live freely in their regained homeland.\n229.\tThe meeting last August of the implementation committee entrusted with the organization of the referendum on self-determination in the territory had conclusive results, which are an important step towards the rapid and satisfactory solution of the problem.. To ensure the prompt implementation of those decisions, it would be desirable for Morocco to agree to begin negotiations as soon as possible with the POLISARIO Front* concerning a ceasefire, thus promoting the proper functioning of a complex operation which will require a high sense of responsibility and political will on the part of the two parties to the conflict.\n230.\tFavorable conditions must be created for true consultations with all those interested- that is, the Sahraoui people- in order to give that people, carrying on the struggle, every opportunity to have their voice heard and freely to. decide their own destiny.\n231.\tIn connection with the Comorian Island of Mayotte, it is pleasing that talks have begun, and are continuing, between the French and Comorian Governments to find a just and lasting solution in accordance with the resolutions on the subject adopted by the United Nations.\n232.\tIn the Middle East, the periodic upheavals, including outbreaks of blind violence* such as the latest events in Lebanon, demonstrate -if need there be for that- the vital necessity for a global solution which will really resolve the prolonged crisis in that legion.\n233.\tEvery year the expansionism and aggressiveness of Israel are vigorously denounced and condemned by the General Assembly. But Israel consolidates its occupation of occupied Arab lands, persists in colonizing them, encourages instability in southern Lebanon and proceeds by its murderous bombings and raids to the slow destruction of that country. More than that, Israel's arrogance led it to bomb the territory of Iraq, destroying the Ibmuz nuclear facility under false pretexts, violating Iraq's sovereignty and raising the state of war to an ever more serious level. We may rightly ask how far Israel can go In building up hatred in all its neighbouring States, in running counter to all the peace initiatives of its own friends and in ruining all the patient efforts of the international community and the United Nations.\n234.\tCape Verde remains convinced that a solution to the Middle East problem necessarily involves a definitive solution of the Palestinian problem- that is, the restoration to those heroic people of their legitimate national rights, including the right to create their own national State, under the leadership of their sole representative, the PLO, and the return of all the Arab territories occupied by Israel, including Jerusalem. That is the price of peace, which is the fervent hope and objective of the international community.\n235.\tThe state of war which persists between Iran and Iraq, despite the many attempts at mediation by various organizations and States, in particular the non-aligned movement, is a cause of deep concern to the whole international community.\n236.\tIt is the fervent hope of Cape Verde  those two non-aligned States will be able once again to follow the course of fraternity and co-operation, thus greatly contributing to the re-establishment of detente and stability in that region.\n237.\tIn South-East Asia decisive steps must be taken towards the establishment of a climate in which dialogue can flourish. Political negotiation must in the end triumph over the policy of confrontation. It is the hope of Cape Verde that the various, countries involved will succeed in overcoming opposition and confrontation in favour of understanding and co-operation based on their legitimate interests.\n238.\tThe national liberation struggle waged by the people of East Timor under the leadership of FRETILIN, which some would like to stifle, deserves the full admiration and support of the international community. We are convinced that the faits accomplis that have been imposed as a political method in opposition to the struggle of the national liberation movements are totally in violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The General Assembly at this session must, in the name of human rights, and of the right of peoples to self-determination, assume its responsibilities in that situation and\nfind the proper means to ensure implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Organization.\n239.\tMany other situations persist where lack of respect for the principles of contemporary International law block' the fulfillment of the aspirations of the people to development and peace. In Cyprus, independence, unity and territorial integrity, as well as the non-aligned status of the country, all continue to be threatened. In Afghanistan, we must once again reaffirm the right of the Afghan people freely to choose the most appropriate means of achieving development, peace and the building up of a prosperous society. In Latin America there still persist situations which are an open challenge to the principles and objectives of the United Nations, through the perpetuation of a policy of interference and intervention in the internal affairs of the States of that region.\n240.\tLikewise, the persistent efforts of the heroic people of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of its country without foreign interference are blocked, by repeated attempts to impose the establishment of two Koreas. We are convinced that the adoption of specific measures, in keeping with the principles and recommendations of the non-aligned movement and the replacement of the armistice agreement by a final peace treaty will bring about for the Korean people the achievement of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.\n241.\tThe situation in the Indian Ocean continues to give rise to disquiet on the part of the coastal States because of the constant threat to peace and security it implies. Despite the initiatives of the international community and. In particular, the efforts made by the coastal States to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace, the situation has hardly changed since the last session of the General Assembly.\n242.\tAt the beginning of this Third United Nations Development Decade, at a time when firm support has been declared for the establishment of a system of international relations where peace will be based on the ability to satisfy the basic needs of all nations, the renewed impetus of the arms race constitutes a cause for profound concern.\n243.\tViolence is once again becoming an instrument of international relations. While it is admitted at present that the arms race in all its aspects conflicts with efforts aimed at diminishing international tension in order to establish a viable system of international, peace and security -and peace and security must be founded on the most scrupulous respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations- the policy of confrontation is being imposed on the world with all the disasters that follow in its train.\n244.\tAs one of the Sahel countries, and one of the least developed countries. Cape Verde views with concern and profoundly deplores the arms race to destroy mankind, which every year swallows up huge sums of money that could be invested to alleviate the innumerable sufferings of the hundreds of millions of destitute men and women throughout the world.\n245.When we see that a single week's military expenditure amounts to the annual sum needed to promote the restoration of the economic situation of the least developed countries, we. must conclude that it is our pressing duty to put an end to the dangerous paradox of the arms.\n246.\tWe are of the view that the international community, during this Second United Nations Disarmament Decade, must ensure the implementation of the Program of Action drawn up at the tenth special session of the Genera] Assembly Resolution S-1012, section 111] and vigorously reject any action that would, distort its objectives and, jeopardize, its outcome.\n247.\tIt is necessary to refer once again to the injustice of the existing international economic system, which mercilessly strikes at the developing countries, blocking their every attempt to escape from the tragic situation in which they find themselves.\n248.\tEfforts designed to induce the rich countries to participate in the negotiations dealing with the global evaluation of all existing problems, including raw materials, energy and trade, as well as currency problems, finances, and industrial and agricultural development, have come up against the opposition of certain Western countries, Apart from these unfruitful attempts, I must mention the difficulties met with by the developing countries, in the context of the Group of 77, in.discussing international economic problems with their industrialized partners, after the failure of the eleventh special session of the. General Assembly. Suffice it to mention by way of example the impossibility of discussing the item inscribed on the agenda of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly under the heading \\\"Launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development\\\".\n249.\tA global program to achieve international cooperation with the participation of all countries is an urgent need in the present international economic situation. The intransigence shown by some countries participating in the global negotiations that could bring about the establishment of a new international economic order results from an attitude that ignores the fact, although dependent relationships still predominate, that the existing forms of interdependence are based on the political and moral support of two thirds of mankind.\n250.\tOur situation on the periphery of the International economic system, having been subject to centuries of colonialist and imperialist exploitation, already contains other political elements that would prevent us from passively accepting development models based on assumptions that run counter to our interests and ore alien both to our preferences and to our social and cultural world.\n251.\tFurthermore, specific measures should be taken re-suiting from political will to achieve the creation of a new system that will enable mankind as a whole equitably to enjoy the accumulated wealth and the scientific and technological progress that exists. Negligence or ignorance of those self-evident aspects may well lead to situations whose consequences cannot be foreseen, first because historical relations among peoples have changed qualitatively as a result of the near-eradication of Colonial relations and, secondly, because the economic situation of underdeveloped countries objectively does not allow them to continue to tolerate the evils stemming from the grave structural problems created by the present system.\n252.\tThe determination of our peoples to Improve their standard of living in terms of health, food, training, education, culture and well-being is more than a just aspiration: it is a primary exigence of contemporary civilization. In denouncing the unjust system that condemns a large part of mankind to subhuman conditions, we do not claim to judge or name the guilty parties. Our primary concern is international peace and the future of mankind. That is why responsibility must be collective and why solutions cannot hinge upon the selfish interests of one country or groups of countries.\n253.\tOn 1 May 1974 the General Assembly, at its sixth special session, concluded that the system of International economic relations is incompatible with the historic changes that have taken place and the objective need for the economic and social development of the peoples. It then proclaimed the need to work together for the establishment of a new international economic order [see resolutions 3201(S-Vi) and 3202(S-Vl)].\n254.\tWhat has happened since then? For the developing countries, there has been a further deterioration in the terms of trade, a growing inability to achieve self-sufficiency in food, the obvious impossibility of increasing their participation in world industrial production, growing difficulties in obtaining access to technology and an alarming Increase in their foreign debt. On the side of the industrialized countries, we witness growing intransigence in the defence of the privileges gained through centuries of exploitation and clear opposition to any initiative that might alter the existing structures.\n255.\tWe know that the establishment of a new international economic order requires programmed actions within the developing countries themselves. It is on this basis that, under, the auspices of UNCTAD, the developing countries have worked out the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing \\\"technical Co-operation among Developing Countries' and the Arusha Program for Collective Self-Reliance and Framework for Negotiations' to carry out a thorough examination of their own needs and the resources available for the improvement of their economies through horizontal co-operation. At the regional and sub-regional level, the developing countries have attempted to promote initiatives that would serve as a basis for the establishment of a new kind of cooperation. On the African continent, for example, the Lagos Plan of Action is clear proof that economic and social development problems constitute a constant source of concern for our leaders. However we must continue to face the problem of the lack of progress in the present International economic situation which is hindering any attempts at economic emancipation by the developing countries.\n256.\tThere is, however, a group of countries whose situation deserves special attention; this is the group identified as the \\\"least developed countries\\\", which now numbers -31 countries and a combined population of more than 300 million. The socio-economic facts regarding this group are well known.\n257.\tAt the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held at Paris from 1 to 14 September 1981, Mr. Aristides Pereira, the President of the Republic of Cape Verde, on behalf of the 21 least developed African countries, stated:\n\\\"Despite the special nature of the problems facing these countries and the need to find specific solutions, it is none the less evident that the definitive solution of the problems of development of the least developed countries, while depending on national efforts, will have to rest definitively on the dismantlement of all the structures of political and economic domination and on the creation of an international climate of peace, concerted effort and mutual respect, in which the desire to arrive at a comprehensive solution of the international economic crisis and the existing disparities between nations and men must take precedence over all other considerations\\\".\n258.\tThe Conference concluded its work by adopting the Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, which was subsequently discussed at length in the North-South dialog. We note with satisfaction the political will expressed in this connection by the majority of members of the international community in favor of participating in restructuring and in making viable the economies of the least developed countries. We should have liked the Program to be more specific not only as regards its timetable but also the resources available to it. However, we welcome the objectives put forward. If they were to materialize they would represent an Important step forward in relations between the industrialized countries and the developing countries, end in the final analysis they would contribute to the establishment of a new international economic order.\n259.\tFor some years now the international community has followed with keen attention and expectation the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, The Republic of Cape Verde, as an archipelago State, attaches great importance to that Conference, and it has actively participated in the search for a collective solution for the establishment of a new legal order for the oceans that will make it possible to use them peacefully and to exploit their resources wisely.\n260.\tWe believe that the adoption of a convention on the Law of the Sea is an urgent and imperative need for all nations truly committed to the prevention of conflict and chaos on the seas. We share the legitimate hopes of the overwhelming majority of countries, as stated quite clearly during the second part of the tenth session of the Conference, which took place at Geneva in August 1981, and we believe that the time has come for all States to shoulder their responsibility of completing that precious legal instrument, on which work has been under way uninterruptedly for almost a decade.\n261.\tWe hope that developments In our time will awaken the common sense of all those who believe in a past that is no longer adapted to the present, and we hope that the final session of the Conference, scheduled to take place in New York in April and May 1982 will truly be the last.\n262.\tThe economic situation in Cape Verde is sufficiently well known because of the many reports submitted by various national departments as well as by international agencies. It would be redundant to describe it once again here. However, it is never superfluous to underline the difficulty of the situation which existed in 1975, when we acceded to independence. We inherited a country in the Sahel ravaged by advanced desertification, with agriculture constituting the basis of the economy but paradoxically representing less than 20 per cent of the gross national product, poor in natural resources and without a significant industrial sector or any other sizable productive activity. The economy of Cape Verde was based on trade and services, supplemented by remittances from its emigrants and by the aid given in extremis by the colonial Government. On the other hand, the effort that the people and the Government of Cape Verde have made in all areas under the direction of its vanguard party, the PAICV,\\\" for the purpose of consolidating our Independence and assuring the dignity of the people of Cape Verde is internationally recognized. For socio-economic policy, basically designed to improve the well-being of our people, has gradually gained recognition from all those who are concerned about our economic life. That policy, based on austerity and wise management of all national resources, has proved to be a most important instrument in overcoming the most difficult moments of our life as an independent nation and in laying down the foundations for building a viable economy.\n263.\tWe are pleased to express our gratitude at this time to the international community and the United Nations system as a whole for the aid given to our country.\n264.\tUnfortunately, the continuation of the drought which has caused us to suffer the loss of another agricultural year's harvests has frustrated a great part of our efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in terms of food. We should like to appeal to the international community once again to respond to the needs of our people with the generosity that it has always, shown us in the past.\n265.\tDespite all kinds of difficulties, we note some positive progress In the solution of the principal, problems affecting our planet.\n266.\tRelations among peoples, based on a new conception of moral, political and juridical factors, are becoming increasingly adapted to the legitimate aspirations of the peoples for peace, progress and social well-being.\n267.\tW are convinced that the United Nations, which has made a positive contribution to that evolution, will, with the perseverance and devotion of its Members, show itself increasingly equal to its responsibilities, thus making an important contribution to the defence of peace, security and international development.\n268.\t We should like to express the hope that the work of this session will result In innovative and courageous Initiatives so to ensure that the near future may see the expression of a renewed will for peace and agreement capable of bringing calm and detente where there Is now a spirit of confrontation and tension.\n269. That is our most ardent hope and, we are sure, the most Cherished objective of the International, community,\n"

        "file_text": " Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your, election to the office of president of this session of the General Assembly. I extend to you, as well as to the Secretary-General, best wishes for success in your work. I should also like to pay a tribute to the work of your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar.\n52.\tI welcome the admission of two new States, Belize and the Republic of Vanuatu, to membership in the United Nations. I extend to them sincere congratulations on the attainment of their independence.\n53.\tEvery year the Assembly meets to discuss the most important issues relating to the state of the world. Every year from this rostrum important appeals are made for an arrangement of world affairs that would rid mankind of fear and mutual mistrust, so that it could advance along the road on which the ideals of the Charter could find general application, in keeping with the greatness of man and his ceaseless creative activity.\n54.\tHowever, never before have we had to face such a contradictory and peculiar dilemma. Efforts to continue the process of detente exist side by side with feverish efforts to return to the \\\"cold war\\\". The endeavors of the peace loving forces in the vanguard of which Czechoslovakia is actively struggling to avert confrontation are at the same time being opposed by attempts to achieve military superiority and world economic hegemony. The general awareness of the inadmissibility of nuclear war is being opposed by plans and preparations for the waging of a supposedly limited version of such a war.\n55.\tThis state of affairs prevails only because the policy of detente does not suit the bellicose forces of imperialism and hegemonism. Thus, while intimidating people through imputing a nonexistent threat from the East, they initiate new rounds of the arms race. Thus, while hypocritically labelling others as \\\"international terrorists\\\", they themselves terrorize entire continents. While demagogically accusing socialist countries of alleged violations of human rights, they themselves allow political prisoners to die of hunger and are unjustly condemning millions of people to the iniquity of unemployment. While groundlessly condemning others, they are shedding the blood of innocent persons in El Salvador, southern Africa and elsewhere. Thus, in representing the question, for example, of free trade or of stimulating investment as practically the only key problems of the world today, they are distracting attention from what are in fact the most important problems of the day the preservation of peace and security, disarmament and the struggle against the exploitation of the developing countries by transnational corporations, against colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, Zionism and apartheid. There is no doubt that it is those forces which are to blame for the complication of international developments.\n56.\tAs is always the case in such complex circumstances, increased responsibility falls on all those who are concerned for the fate of mankind, as increased responsibility falls on the Organization to put an end to these adventures. The flight of an arrow must not be halted after it has been shot from the bow. Not a single resolution on the maintenance of peace and disarmament should be allowed to become nothing more than a stock number in the archives of unresolved problems. Every politician and every diplomat must be consistently committed to the implementation of these resolutions.\n57.\tThe unending armament programs of imperialism aimed at achieving military superiority should serve as a warning to everyone. Although they remind one of the futile attempts to square a circle, their objective and actual results are ever more modern, more sophisticated, more destructive and more fearsome types of weapons. How timely once again today are Friedrich Engels' remarks that \\\"new technology daily discards as scrap all inventions which have just been introduced, and ever new explosive substances of unprecedented scope and effectiveness constantly emerge. At the same time, however, it is not entirely clear who exactly, in the final analysis, is going to suffer from the effects of these weapons those who fire them or those at whom they are aimed.\\\"\n58.\tIt is therefore in the interest of all of us that we, in time and effectively, erect a barrier to war and to material preparations for it. Let us expose the sophisms that are being used to justify war and armaments: all the lies about the \\\"compatibility between closing the armaments gap and disarmament\\\"; all those fallacious arguments about the so-called humane manner of waging a nuclear war; and all those attempts to have war in Europe waged by Europeans, in Asia by Asians and in Africa by Africans and thereby to transform our continents into theaters of limited nuclear war; all steps which, in the final analysis, have led to the production of the neutron bomb, which the Czechoslovak people together with peace-loving people throughout the world categorically condemn, and which warrants the condemnation of the Organization. Does it not make a mockery of the peaceful, peacemaking Organization when the representative of one of the permanent members of the Security Council asserts that there are more important matters than peace, while another states that each generation must have its own war? Is this naivete, or is it in fact actual preparation for war?\n59.\tIt is only by means of dialog and cooperation that tangible and realistic solutions can be found for all the controversial issues of international relations. There is no problem that we would not be willing to try to resolve by means of negotiations.\n60.\tThe time when one country could conduct the world with a nuclear baton has ended irrevocably. What we must do now is come to terms with this fact once and for all. Similarly, it is impossible to be a part of the existing system of international relations and at the same time to disregard the appeal for peace of the overwhelming majority of mankind. Look hew tenaciously the European nations are resisting American military plans. Thus what we are presented with is a proved and time-tested realistic solution, which is to resume the cooperation of the 1970s and to continue the implementation of both the spirit and the letter of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, held at Helsinki in 1975.\n61.\tThat appears to us to be precisely the reason why, listening carefully to this debate, we hear a strong appeal from all continents for a continuation of the policy of detente, which reflects the swelling wave of antimissile and antineutron bomb protests on the part of the broad mass of people in Western Europe and elsewhere.\n62.\tIt is certainly true, as was stated a few days ago, that when a bureaucrat who has only recently assumed his new post has fabricated a new doctrine, not everyone has to dance to his tune; such times have gone forever.\n63.\tWhat means can we seek to restore the current complicated international climate to a healthy state? What method of effective action is to be used to further develop the process of detente? In our view, both the means and the method are contained in the broad range of peace proposals put forward at the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union by Leonid Brezhnev. As President Gustdv Husfik stated at the sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, this peace program for the 1980s represents a concentrated reflection of our own vital interests.\n64.\tTherefore, it would be unforgivable to disregard the most vital interests of nations if those to whom the peace message of the Soviet people was addressed did not proceed beyond mere examination of it, or indeed it they were to go so far as to reject it. After all, the mere discussion of any of these proposals, not to mention their actual implementation, would allow mankind to breathe more freely.\n65.\tThe main proposals are as follows: the Soviet Union calls for the immediate resumption of a comprehensive dialog with the United States at the highest level and, in particular, talks on the limitation of strategic arms with the preservation of everything that has already been achieved; it proposes the convening of a carefully prepared special session of the Security Council at the highest level in order to improve the international situation and to prevent war; it proposes a moratorium on the deployment of new medium range nuclear weapons; it proposes the expansion of regional security measures, which would represent an immensely valuable impetus to the solution of the key problem of the Madrid meeting, namely, the long-prepared and universally expected decision on convening a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe. We hope that the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO\\ will be aware of their political responsibility and will contribute, in the second.stage of that meeting, to its successful conclusion. Finally, the Soviet Union proposes consideration at this session of the question of concluding a treaty prohibiting the stationing of any weapons in outer space. Like all peace-loving countries, we are keenly interested in ensuring that outer space never becomes another arena of the arms race. This desire is strengthened by the fact that three years ago Czechoslovakia, thanks to its cooperation with the Soviet Union, became the third country after the Soviet Union and the United States to send one of its citizens into space.\n66.\tSpecial emphasis must be placed on the appeal made at the seventh meeting by the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrei Gromyko, that the United Nations should adopt a new political document of fundamental importance, namely, a declaration on preventing a nuclear catastrophe and condemning the first use of nuclear weapons as the gravest crime against humanity.\n67.\tWe wish to express our conviction that the current session will also prove to be an important stage in the preparation for the forthcoming second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which can serve as a bridgehead for the convening of a world disarmament conference. In this context, we are prepared to cooperate actively with all delegations, as we have in the Committee on Disarmament and in the Preparatory Committee.\n68.\tWe advocate a speedy and specific solution of the broad range of disarmament problems, ranging from questions of nuclear disarmament to partial measures, such as a complete ban on nuclear weapon tests, the prohibition of chemical and radiological weapons and the strengthening of security safeguards for nonnuclear countries, and including the creation of zones of peace in various parts of the world and the reduction of military budgets. All of that would be on the basis of the principles of equality and security.\n69.\tHowever, these goals can be achieved oriTy if there is a sincere interest and political will on the part of all States. It is these States that form the supporting pillars of the Declaration on International Cooperation for Disarmament [General Assembly resolution 34188], which was adopted, on our initiative, in 1979. We believe it to be necessary for the world forum, especially in the current international situation, to reaffirm the importance of the Declaration as a basic code bf conduct for States in disarmament negotiations. It would be useful if the General Assembly appealed for the consistent observance and implementation of that Declaration and once again mobilized the political will of States to develop international cooperation in disarmament talks, unrestricted by any preconditions or questions not directly related to them. The General Assembly should also appeal to all States to refrain from any actions that would make more difficult or impossible the achievement of specific disarmament results. In this regard we intend to submit an appropriate draft resolution to the Assembly at its current session.\n70.\tWe have a vital interest in seeing Europe become permanently a region of stable peace and constructive cooperation. As a country in the very heart of Europe, we feel vitally threatened by the plans of NATO to deploy new United States medium-range nuclear missiles in a number of Western European countries. The implementation of that decision, motivated by the endeavors of the West to achieve strategic military superiority, is fraught with far reaching harmful consequences for peace and security, and not only on our continent.\n71.\tWe therefore repose great hopes in the talks between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of the nuclear weapons in Europe, agreed upon, virtually a few steps from this hall, at the recent meeting between Foreign Minister Gromyko and Secretary of State Haig. The talks will concentrate on the conclusion of an agreement on .the limitation or, what is even better, the reduction, of medium range nuclear weapons, an agreement that should at the same time be concluded in close relation with the corresponding forward-based nuclear system of the United States, with due account being taken of all the factors affecting the strategic situation in Europe. That is, in fact, the only way to maintain the existing approximate parity.\n72.\tThe strengthening of detente and security in Europe would also promote progress in the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, talks that for several years now, through no fault of ours, have been deadlocked.\n73.\tWe are very interested in the efforts to establish a nuclear-free zone in northern Europe.\n74.\tWe believe that the Mediterranean also should be transformed into a region of lasting peace and fruitful cooperation. The need for this has been underscored by the recent attack by United States armed forces against Libya.\n75.\tSocialist Czechoslovakia, as a firm link in the Warsaw Treaty and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, is consistently pursuing the coordinated policy of the socialist countries aimed at securing world peace and the development of detente. That policy, worked out by the congresses of our parties and given valuable impetus by the sessions of the Political Consultative Committee, the Crimea meetings at the highest level and the meetings of the\nCommittee or the Ministers for Foreign Affairs oftfie'Warsaw Treaty, is our longterm as well as our everyday program.\n76.\tThus we are all the more deeply concerned over the situation in the Polish People's Republic, our immediate neighbor with which we are connected by thousands of years of history, a long common border and what is most important a common path to socialist construction. We wish to express our conviction that the Polish leadership will rebuff the attacks of both external and internal enemies of socialism. We fully share its view that only a socialist Poland, the class ally of its friends, can constructively promote the cause of peaceful relations in Europe and be a factor in a stable Europe.\n77.\tEqually, we cannot remain indifferent to the imperialist intrigues around socialist Cuba; we most emphatically denounce those intrigues and resolutely demand that an end be put to them without delay.\n78.\tIn order to pursue our policy of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, we believe it to be extremely valuable and virtually indispensable to maintain vigorous and continuous political contacts with the participants in the Helsinki conference. That is why we are developing such contacts systematically and on a longterm basis. We unswervingly observe the treaties by means of which we have normalized our relations with a number of those countries, in particular the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria, and we are striving for good-neighborly relations and cooperation with them. We maintain an effectively operating system of political consultations with Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Luxembourg. We are constantly developing a broad, unprecedented economic cooperation, as well as vigorous cultural contacts. In that context, we also expect that our constructive approach to the settlement of outstanding financial property claims in our relations with the United States will lead to the return of our gold treasure stolen by the Nazis and thus to the removal of the obstacles that still burden our relations. We take an analogous position concerning similar negotiations with the United Kingdom, and in our turn we expect the same approach from the other side.\n79.\tAt the same time, Czechoslovakia is developing all round, mutually beneficial relations with the overwhelming majority of the nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America. The results of the recent official visit by the President of Czechoslovakia, Gustav Husak, to Libya, Ethiopia and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen are further proof of this. We intend to continue our traditionally good relations with India and to develop our relations with other countries too.\n80.\tAt the thirty-fifth session [18th meeting], I stated that a settlement of the situation in the Middle East had not come any closer. This year, regrettably, I can only add that it has become even further removed. The reason for this, as in the past, has been the aggressive policy of Tel Aviv and the support it receives from imperialists as the guarantors of its unprecedented piratical raids. What else can we call the barbarous raids carried out by Israel on Beirut, Saida, Nabatiyah those Coventries of Lebanon? How else can we view their unprecedented attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad? How can one reconcile oneself to the fact that the sovereign territory of neighboring Lebanon is penetrated by Israeli commandos? How else can one judge the efforts by the United States to gain a military foothold there?\n81.\tIt is becoming increasingly apparent, as we have been saying from the beginning, that no deals of the Camp David type will lead to the settlement of the crisis in the Middle East. A comprehensive political settlement must be based on respect for the legitimate interests of all the States and peoples in that region. This requires an immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied since 1967, full respect for the right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determinationF, including the establishment of their own independent State, and the safeguarding of the security and sovereignty of all the States of the Middle East. We further advocate the convening of an international conference to eliminate that dangerous hotbed of tension, with the participation of all interested parties, including the PLO.\n82.\tWe also fully support the just endeavors of the Afghan people to develop and defend the achievements of the April 1978 revolution and their national independence in the face of attacks by counterrevolutionary forces supported by imperialism and hegemonism. As we stressed during the recent visit to Czechoslovakia by a delegation from the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan headed by Babrak Karmal, we resolutely support the concrete and realistic proposals put forward by the Government of Afghanistan on 14 May 1980 for the normalization of relations with the neighboring countries of Pakistan and Iran, proposals which were further amplified in the statement of 24 August 1981 [Al361457, annex]. It is our view that the cause of peace in the region would be well served if both those countries accepted the constructive appeal that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan, who is present here, made from this rostrum [8th meeting] for the consideration of those proposals, on a bilateral or trilateral basis, during this very session. However, no negotiations can be held without the participation of the sole legitimate Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Deliberations on the internal situation in that country are completely unacceptable.\n83.\tWe fully associate ourselves with those who support the initiatives and constructive proposals of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, of Laos and of Kampuchea aimed at strengthening confidence and transforming SouthEast Asia into a region of peace and stability, including the proposal to hold a regional conference with the participation of the countries of IndoChina and the member countries of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [AS\u00a3A/V] [see A!36186, annex I]. At the same time, we most emphatically denounce the hostile manoeuvres connected with the artificially created question of Kampuchea. That fully applies also to the socalled international conference on Kampuchea, which constituted a flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and an interference in the internal affairs of that country. We hope that no one will again succeed in misusing the name of the United Nations for the selfish and dubious designs pursued by certain countries.\n84.\tIt is our irreversible position that an end should be put to a situation, in which persons representing nobody and responsible for the genocide of millions of their fellow citizens should occupy a seat that should long since have belonged to the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.\n85.\tThe policy of stirring up unrest, instability and conflict in SouthEast Asia and other regions, which is the product of the collusion between imperialism and the current Chinese leadership, is sharply at variance with the interests of world peace and with the vital needs of all nations. Nor can Peking's hegemonistic and aggressive policy bring anything good to China itself or to its people. As for ourselves, Czechoslovakia is ready, as we have repeatedly stressed, to improve its relations with the People's Republic of China, while consistently preserving the fundamental principles of our foreign policy.\n86.\tThe strengthening of security and peace in that area and throughout the continent of Asia would also be significantly enhanced by concrete talks on confidence-building measures in the regions of the Indian Ocean and the far East, as proposed by the Soviet Union.4 We also regard as highly valuable the proposal by the Mongolian People's Republic for the conclusion of a convention on mutual non aggression and non-use of force among the States in Asia and the Pacific region [see A/36/388].\n87.\tAs for the question of Korea, we believe that it must be resolved by peaceful means. We, too, are of the opinion that the corresponding proposals of President Kim II Sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea constitute a suitable basis for such a solution, as presented at the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n88.\tWe continue to stand for the safeguarding of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and nonaligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. We trust that the continuing contacts between representatives of both Cypriot communities will lead precisely in that direction.\n89.\tThe racist Pretoria regime, with the continuous, comprehensive and overt support of the West, continues its flagrant violation of the fundamental human rights of the African population. In contravention of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), it illegally occupies Namibia in an attempt to transform it, with the assistance of the so-called group of five, into a neo-colonial State and to paralyse SWAPO, the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. Czechoslovakia maintains complete solidarity with the just struggle of the people of Namibia, led by SWAPO, for the achievement of full independence. We equally support the efforts of the people of South Africa to eliminate the regime of apartheid and racial discrimination.\n90.\tWe categorically condemn the overt and arrogant aggression of the South African racists against Angola, which is a crude affront to our Organization and a threat to international peace and security.\n91.\tWe resolutely support the implementation of the decisions of the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, held in Paris from 20 to 27 May 1981,5 and of the recent eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, on Namibia [resolution ES8/2]. We favor the imposition by the Security Council of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa, in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter. \n92.\tWe attach the greatest importance to the struggle of the nonaligned movement against imperialism, colonialism and racism and for peace and social progress. In the 20 years of its existence, the movement has proved beyond doubt that it is an important indeed, indispensable positive factor in international life. While maintaining the peaceful and anti-imperialist principles on which it was built, the movement can, particularly at this time, make a significant contribution to improving the complicated international situation. ' \u00bb\n93.\tWe continue to support the demands of the developing countries for the restructuring of international economic relations on a just, equal and democratic basis. In so doing we proceed from our position of principle with regard to the solution of that problem.\n94.\tThe whole history of mankind proves that the wisdom and responsibility of statesmen are put to the test particularly in complicated international conditions. After all, it is not difficult to make the international political situation worse. It is much more difficult to ease tension and to prevent the worst from happening, which must be the primary concern of us all.\n95.\tSince the very first days of the existence of the United Nations, at whose' birth in San Francisco we were present, we have always held the view that the Organization should hold a place of honor in mankind's endeavors to safeguard a secure peace both for the present and for the future. That is what the people of Czechoslovakia believe. We have striven consistently for support by all Member States for the Charter, the content of which is outside any time-frame and therefore requires no change.\n96.\tWe trust that this session will place at the service of the most noble ideal of human society, the ideal of peace and cooperation, all the potential, influence and authority of this body as a world Organization.\n97.\tSocialist Czechoslovakia will commit all its endeavors to the success of that cause.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, at the outset I should like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that you will preside over our work with the experience and wisdom for which you are well known. I should also like to take this opportunity to convey, through you, to the brotherly people of Iraq the greetings of the Arab people of Egypt and their best wishes for a bright future, progress, peace and prosperity.\n242.\tI also wish, on behalf of my Government, to pay a special tribute to the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. von Wechmar. I particularly wish to commend him on his wisdom and experience in presiding over the work of the Assembly and also for the impeccable manner in which he represented his friendly country, the Federal Republic of Germany, and its great and industrious people.\n243.\tIt gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the people and Government of Egypt, to welcome the admission of Vanuatu to the United Nations. I wish to convey to the people and Government of Vanuatu our heartfelt congratulations.\n244.\tI also wish, on behalf of the people and Government of Egypt, to congratulate the people and Government of Belize on their independence and their admission to the international community of the United Nations.\n245.\tIt has been a year since we met here at the beginning of the last session of the General Assembly, in September 1980. It has been a year crowded, with serious political developments, ranging from political problems to economic crises to human tragedies, the result of which is the deterioration of conditions in many areas of the world in a way that now threatens the accomplishments of our civilization. There has been no distinction between one continent and another or between one society and another. All these ominous developments, which seem to be minimal when compared to the problems of poverty and underdevelopment of the third world, place on the Assembly the responsibility of pausing and assessing the international situation and the destiny towards which we are moving.\n246.\tMembers will recall that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt stated in his statement to the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session [16th meeting, paras. 41 and 42] that the existing international political order requires serious scrutiny. He stated that:\n\\\"The recent alarming developments that have challenged the Charter and the international order that we have subscribed to and adhered to since 1945 have not only created a perilous situation of political upheaval sometimes even bordering on chaos, but have also accentuated the disparities between the powerful and the weak countries. Moreover, such challenges have resulted in the continuance and exacerbation of racist policies and ideologies, the use of force in international relations, the acquisition of territory by war, the denial of legitimate national rights foremost among them the right to self determination and last but not least the aggravation of the situation which has caused the efforts to achieve disarmament to become locked in a vicious circle.\n\\\"The continuance of such policies and the situation resulting therefrom have had a negative impact on the conduct of international relations. The time has therefore come for us to intensify our efforts to put an end to the problems posed by such policies and to explore means of satisfying the requirements of the international community and therefore the interests of the peoples and nations.\\\"\n247.\tA close examination of the report of the Secretary General on the work of the Organization, presented to the current session [A/36/1], reflects an identical view and urges that appropriate measures should be undertaken to address the situation with courage and a constructive spirit.\n248.\tEgypt's position of the use of force in all its manifestations war, aggression or occupation has been made abundantly clear.~We resolutely oppose what has befallen the sister State of Afghanistan, what is being perpetrated against the fraternal people of Lebanon and what has occurred in Kampuchea. We also view with deep regret the fratricidal wars which have taken place and are still taking place around the world. It is for these reasons that I wish to reiterate once again this year the proposal made by my Government in its statement during the general debate at the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n249.\tThe Egyptian Government will propose, at the appropriate time, the convening in the near future of a special session of the General Assembly to assess the role of the existing international machinery and its potential, in particular the role of the collective security system in the maintenance of international peace and security. The fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations may be an appropriate occasion for the convening of such a special session. Meanwhile, it is incumbent upon us to utilize fully the possibilities afforded by the existing machinery. In this connection, I wish to propose the revitalization of periodic meetings of the Security Council with the participation of ministers or special representatives, as envisaged in Article 28, paragraph 2, of the Charter. We all recall that periodic meetings of the Council at the ministerial level were held at the beginning of the 1970s. It may therefore be timely for similar meetings to be held in the near future, now that we are at the beginning of the 1980s and the challenges we face are greater and more urgent and pressing.\n250.\tTowards this objective, it is important that the Security Council have a clear and permanent set of rules of procedure that unambiguously stipulate the majority required for decisions on the various issues before the Council, along the lines of Article 18 of the Charter which deals with decisions of the General Assembly on the same matters. This will make the legal system of the United Nations more competent to deal with the many developments that have occurred in the international system and with the requirements inherent in the pursuit of an order based on freedom, equality and fraternity.\n251.\tI address myself particularly to the nonaligned nations, with whom we share our ideals and objectives, and ask them to play the role expected of them in supporting these proposals. For there is no one more competent and more able than the countries of the nonaligned movement to sustain that initiative so as to ensure that we do not deviate from our objective. The movement was established as a vigorous and universal movement dedicated to the liberation and independence of peoples and as a shield against the cold war and instability in the relations between the superPowers. At present the movement is, without a doubt, better equipped to undertake that role. Egypt, as a pioneer of the nonaligned movement and a firm believer in its ideals and objectives, is gratified to see the movement proceed along its correct path, regaining its vitality by ridding itself of many of the factors which during the past decade contributed to its polarization and deviation from its true course and to its sabotage from within. The ministerial meeting of the nonaligned movement held at New Delhi last February was a milestone on the road back towards the true and constructive course of non alignment and good sense.\n252.\tI have spoken with candor on the international political order. I shall speak in the same way about the international economic order, a subject that has been considerably debated, particularly the question of a new international economic order as a possible alternative. Although seven years have elapsed since the sixth special session of the General Assembly, held in 1974, the international community has not been able to reach an agreement on the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice and equality.\n253.\tThe limited results generated by various United Nations conferences towards obtaining effective solutions to the problems that we face have been, to say the least, a matter of great disappointment and dismay. The inability of the international community to resolve such an impasse will no doubt heighten tension and instability and thus endanger world peace.\n254.\tOne of the most serious problems confronting the developing countries is the food crisis. Statistics show that between 400 million and 500 million people, the majority of whom live in Africa and Asia, are threatened with famine. Such a problem, in its manifold economic, political, social and humanitarian dimensions, requires urgent and radical remedies.\n255.\tThere is a solid and firm conviction within the international community of the need to reconsider the present pattern of international economic relations so that they may be based on justice, cooperation and international solidarity and interdependence. That is the only way to arrive at a comprehensive and global approach to solving international economic problems. Such an approach was adopted by the Group of 77 in its untiring efforts to conduct international global negotiations between the North and the South. It is our hope that such negotiations will be launched during this session, after such a long period of inaction.\n256.\tEgypt calls upon the international community and in particular the developed countries to redouble their efforts in order to understand the problems of the developing world and to exhibit more flexibility in their positions so that those negotiations may yield positive results that would ultimately benefit all parties concerned and would thus form the foundation for the establishment of equitable and balanced international relations. In this connection, we are closely following the efforts undertaken by a number of developed and developing countries, foremost among which is the International Conference on Cooperation and Development to be held at Cancun. In spite of our appreciation for any effort to promote international cooperation and foster mutual understanding between developed and developing countries, we see no alternative to international global negotiations within the framework of the NorthSouth dialog.\n257.\tAt the same time, Egypt is actively participating in the efforts undertaken by the developing countries to achieve individual and collective self-reliance. We participated effectively in the High-level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries held at Caracas, which succeeded in laying down a framework for the coordination, monitoring and implementation of economic cooperation among developing countries. This constitutes not only an important step towards fostering greater cooperation between the North and the South but also a turning point from the planning to the implementation stage. It is relevant to point out in this regard that the African countries, for their part, have adopted a program for autonomous development contained in the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa.7 That step is worthy of encouragement and support so that the objectives of the Plan of Action may be fully realized.\n258.\tPolitical stability in this world is primarily dependent on economic stability. That is equally true for the first, second and third worlds. Whereas developing countries should exercise more effort towards autonomous economic and social development, the responsibility towards those who possess fewer resources and are encumbered with greater burdens falls upon the entire international community.\n259.\tEgypt is an intrinsic and major part of a region of the world that is plagued with an immense tragedy: the tragedy of the Palestinian people.\n260.\tAt the risk of repeating what has previously been stated by my Government, I wish to reiterate that the Palestinian question is the core of the Middle East conflict. The solution of this problem is understood by the entire world to be central to total peace in the Middle East. No settlement of the Middle East problem is possible without the just solution of the Palestinian problem on the basis of the realization of Palestinian national rights.\n261.\tEgypt does not consider the Palestinian problem to be a humanitarian problem that requires merely moral and material support, but rather it is a problem that is closely intertwined with the problems of the Egyptian people themselves. Anything that affects the Palestinian people and their security finds an echo in Egypt, and the Egyptian people cannot but respond.\n262.\tEgypt is fully aware that the continuation of the Palestinian problem without a speedy and just solution will heighten the tensions and aggravate the instability that already plague our region. Thus it will not only obstruct the efforts that Egypt is undertaking for development and progress, but also usher alien ideologies are unwelcome foreign interference into our region. Resident Sadat undertook his historic initiative against that background, fully aware that the continuation of the Palestinian tragedy would deal a heavy blow to the aspirations of the Arab nation to progress, rendering it incapable of developing and forcing it to remain static, a prisoner of empty slogans and unrealistic dreams.\n263.\tEgypt sustained a 30 year war in order to regain the rights of the Palestinian people, during which it became a victim of aggression on more than one occasion and suffered the loss of much of its material and human resources because of its support of the Palestinian people. Egypt will continue to maintain its commitment to the Palestinian cause and in particular to the right of the Palestinian people to self determination without foreign interference. It is our conviction that the right to self-determination is a natural right that cannot be forfeited or derogated and that comprehensive peace cannot be realized until the Palestinian people regain their rights within the framework of a comprehensive settlement that also recognizes the right to security of Israel and all other concerned parties, foremost among them the Palestinian people.\n264.\tIt has proved futile for Egypt to continue on a dead-end road, merely bearing the slogan of Palestine and soliciting endless resolutions, as advocated by some, as though such resolutions were an end in themselves, representing victory and the fruit of success. In fact, such slogans and resolutions merely serve to fuel the auctioneering and outbidding that plague the Arab arena, drowning out the Palestinian problem.\n265.\tEgypt has struggled both in peace and in war. It spearheaded the struggle for the resolution of the Palestinian problem. It played a principal role in supporting the creation of the PLO. The universal recognition accorded to the PLO was a direct result of Egyptian diplomatic efforts and the granting of observer status to the PLO was the outcome of efforts in which Egypt played an instrumental part. When the time came even before the 1973 October war for the General Assembly to pronounce itself on the Palestinian problem and the rights of the Palestinian people, the first proposal in that regard since resolution 181 (II) of 1947, which contains the Plan of Partition of Palestine, was that of Egypt in 1970. During the 1973 October war, when President Sadat issued his historic statement calling for the convening of a peace conference, he emphasized the need for the full participation of the representatives of the Palestinian people. Our efforts to reconvene the Geneva Conference focused on the importance of the participation of the Palestinian people in any meeting or conference to be held on the Middle East problem. All those efforts constituted one phase, preparatory to the subsequent phases in our struggle. For us, failure to proceed along those lines would have meant dropping into the abyss of stagnation and becoming a victim of our own policies, thus reverting to our starting point.\n266.\tIn full cognizance of that fact, Egypt considered the circumstances prevailing in the final months of 1977 to be conducive to this new phase a difficult phase, but one that could generate practical results towards a comprehensive settlement. That was the background for President Sadat's statement before the Israeli Knesset, a statement aimed at putting an end to the status quo situation, which Israel was trying hard to impose, and at initiating a new phase. Egypt's historic position, as reflected in President Sadat's statement, was based on the premises that constitute the international consensus for the resolution of the Palestinian problem as laid down by the international community at the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity and in the nonaligned movement. First and foremost among those premises is the right to self-determination, a right which Egypt played a major role in evolving and upholding.\n267.\tEgypt's signing of the Camp David accords in 1978 stemmed from that conviction, as well as from its firm belief that the accords constitute an important step towards the full implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and all its principles and provisions. The accords, we believe, also represent a transitional phase setting the stage for the exercise of self-determination by the Palestinian people. Thus, if supported in good faith by the concerned parties, they would open the door towards PalestinianIsraeli cooperation and coexistence, which would lead to mutual recognition that would enable each party to realize its legitimate rights without adversely affecting the rights of the other.\n268.\tThe framework for a comprehensive peace, as set forth in the Camp David accords, is based, as far as the Palestinian aspect is concerned, on the following five elements, in which we believe: first recognition by Israel of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the necessity to negotiate with them; second, he establishment of an interim Palestinian authority to replace the Israeli military occupation administration; third, the establishment of transitional arrangements; fourth, the commencement of the withdrawal of Israel forces from the West Bank and Gaza; and fifth, security for all parties concerned.\n269.\tThe purpose of the negotiations on full autonomy that took place over the period of one year, from May 1979 to May 1980, was to attain those objectives. However, little progress, if any, has been achieved to date. It was our hope that such a transition period would contribute to alleviating the plight of the Palestinian people and to enabling them to establish their authority over their territory. However, conscious that the door to the attainment of their national rights by the Palestinian people has been irreversibly opened, the Israeli authorities have tried to prevent the success of the negotiations on autonomy. This policy has dealt a considerable blow to the chances of establishing full autonomy in the\nWest Bank and Gaza. Egypt responded by suspending the autonomy negotiations. In fact, that Israeli policy can only be compared to the vilification campaign waged by the rejectionists in the Arab world, who have yet to produce a single positive contribution for the benefit of the Palestinian people.\n270.\tIn spite of Egypt's condemnation of both the Israeli policy and rejectionist schemes, we continue to maintain that a possibility for tangible progress exists. Egypt is convinced that the Palestinian people should not be forced to forfeit an opportunity because of the obstructionist policies of one party or the other. In the next few weeks intensive efforts will be made and it is our hope that they will lead to substantive progress in the area of confidence-building measures and the establishment of the interim period, which constitutes the essence of the present phase of the peace process.\n271.\tIn undertaking these efforts to pave the way to the resolution of the Palestinian problem we do not propose to monopolize the task of finding a solution or to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people. That is not our position at all. The Palestinian problem has its own principals, and our commitment is to prepare the ground for a just solution. It is a commitment that does, not deny and is not negated by the fact that the Palestinian people have their own representative. It merely confirms the organic relationship between Egypt and the Palestinian problem. In saying that, I wish to affirm that the Palestinians a principal component of whose structure is the PLO\u2014should be present at all consultations and negotiations concerning their problem, for it is inconceivable that the Palestinian problem should be discussed without the participation of the representatives of the Palestinian people, who are entitled to recognition and consultation.\n272.\tIn this context, Egypt welcomes any initiative that would contribute to the real solution of the Palestinian problem. In this spirit we welcome the efforts undertaken by the European Community and the proposals for the convening of an international conference by the Secretary General, the President of Romania, Mr. Ceausescu, and the President of the Soviet Union, Mr. Brezhnev. Nevertheless, we consider that the proposed international conference should be the final, not the first, step in establishing a comprehensive peace. We are also following with great interest the efforts undertaken by a number of African leaders. We are open to any initiative, regardless of its origin, that seeks to give a new impetus to the search for a just solution of the Palestinian problem. However, I wish to reiterate before the Assembly that any initiative, proposal or idea must take due account of the following considerations: first, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including the right to their own State, as an inalienable right, equal to that of all other peoples, in freedom and independence; secondly, the right of all States in the region to live in peace; thirdly, the need to complement and enforce the efforts already under way for the peaceful solution of the problem; fourthly, the need to contribute towards mutual recognition by Israel and the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people.\n273.\tI wish to take this opportunity to convey to the Assembly the proposal of President Sadat that the Palestinian people establish a Government in exile as the nucleus of the international identity of the Palestinian entity and that there be mutual recognition by it and the Israeli Government, contributing to the peace process and preserving the impetus necessary for a just settlement of the Palestinian problem.\n274.\tI cannot conclude my remarks on the Palestinian problem without referring to the issue of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Egypt, like all other States and international bodies, categorically rejects any attempt to change the geographic, demographic or legal character of Jerusalem. Occupied Jerusalem is Arab territory and must therefore be returned to Arab sovereignty. We must distinguish between the quest for a united city and the quest for annexation. In the first case there are a number of proposals that, while taking into account the need to have a united city, also take account of the rights of all the parties concerned, foremost among them being the Arab right to sovereignty. Concerning the second case, such an approach is totally rejected on the basis that any expansion based on the use of force is illegitimate and therefore cannot constitute a right.\n275.\tI have dealt in detail with the Palestinian problem because it constitutes the core of the Middle East conflict. There are, however, certain matters concerning the situation in the Middle East as a whole that I wish to put before the Assembly. It is a very complicated and intertwined question.I am happy to present to the Assembly a report on the final Israeli withdrawal from Sinai, preparations for which are now being made so that it may be finalized by April 1982, God willing.\n276.\tIn conformity with the principles and provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), the EgyptianIsraeli treaty stipulates that all Israeli forces, settlements and civilians will be withdrawn beyond the boundaries that existed between Egypt and mandated Palestine without jeopardizing the Gaza Strip. According to the annexes to the treaty, Israel's withdrawal will take place in two stages. The first stage was completed nine months after ratification of the treaty and the second stage ends no later than three years from the date of ratification, that is oh 25 April 1982.\n277.\tWe are pleased to inform the Assembly that the withdrawal arrangements are proceeding as agreed upon. We feel sure that in the near future we will be in a position to inform the United Nations of Israel's complete withdrawal from all Egyptian territories occupied since 5 June 1967, which will constitute an important step towards a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem and a model to be followed to ensure Israel's withdrawal from the remaining Arab territories.\n278.\tHowever, I wish at this juncture to put on record that the EgyptianIsraeli treaty stipulates that the Security Council will be requested to provide the two countries with United Nations peacekeeping forces during the first year after completion of the withdrawal and the total implementation of the treaty. In a letter dated 21 April 1981 from the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the President of the Security Council, Egypt requested the Security Council to make the necessary arrangements for the dispatch of such forces. However, we regret to say that on 18 May 1981 we received from the President of the Security Council a response to the effect that no consensus existed among the members of the Council regarding Egypt's request.\n279.\tFaced with this unjustifiable attitude of some members of the Security Council, which prevented the Council from meeting its responsibilities regarding the maintenance of international peace and security, Egypt opted for an alternative approach to implement the provisions concerning security arrangements contained in resolution 242 (1967). Thus we established a multinational force to carry out the peacekeeping functions that we had hoped the United Nations forces would assume during the present stage. Egypt is hopeful that a just and comprehensive peace will prevail throughout the entire Middle East, thereby obviating the need to keep peacekeeping forces in the region.\n280.\tIn fact, the liberation of Egyptian territories, in implementation of resolution 242 (1967), from an occupation that lasted nearly 15 years is a success for the United Nations that must be recognized, supported and appropriately assessed. Any efforts to separate the United Nations from that accomplishment must be rejected. It is indeed regrettable that that accomplishment offers the only glimmer of hope iii our Middle East region.\n281.\tIn Lebanon, many interests are at play behind the scenes, and the Lebanese people are paying the price in terms of their blood, prosperity and unity. The recent Israeli attack against Beirut and against the sovereignty of Lebanon and its people constitutes a link in the chain of policies aimed at imposing Israel's hegemony over its neighbors. Egypt categorically rejects that policy in form and in content. We say that encouragement of such a policy will dim the prospects for a comprehensive peace and will further inflame the Middle East. The starting point for the resolution of the Lebanese problem is to ensure that the legitimate Lebanese Government exercises its authority over the entire territory of the fraternal country of Lebanon. In this forum 1 call upon all parties engaged in the hostilities in Lebanon to bring their interference to an end so that the Lebanese people may decide their destiny within the context of Arab solidarity and taking due account of the tenets of the Palestinian question.\n282.\tOn the eastern fringes of the Arab world we witness Iran and Iraq locked in a war of attrition that takes its toll of the people of both countries and diverts them from their pursuit of development and progress. The continuation of such a war can only provide an added opportunity for the intensification of superPower competition and rivalry to create spheres of influence in the area.\n283.\tEgypt calls for an end to that war so that each party may regain its rights in conformity with the fundamental principles that govern international conduct, foremost among which is respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. At the same time we warn against the utilization of that situation by the superPowers to further their own interests, thereby threatening the security of the Gulf, an area which represents the eastern approaches to the Arab world. Such a development would threaten the security of Egypt and all other Arab countries, particularly in view of the current dangers inherent in the international situation.\n284.\tIn full cognizance of such a situation, Egypt has expressed its readiness to assume its responsibilities, if requested in conformity with the Arab Joint defense Agreement of 1950. Egypt stands ready to help defend the people of the Gulf against any attack or aggression, and is also ready to provide facilities that would satisfy the defense needs of the Gulf States in conformity with their respective defense agreements.\n285.\tThis position stems from an overall Arab strategy to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity and the nonaligned and Arab character of all Arab countries. At the same time, Egypt unequivocally opposes Israel's policies that seek to spread anarchy in the Middle East, such as the attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor. Egypt supports all resolutions in this regard adopted by the Security Council, the QAU and IAEA.\n286.\tIn addition to its well-known political implications, such an attack has a direct bearing on the efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, an objective which was a matter of consensus at the last session of the General Assembly [resolution 35/147] and the realization of which is vital to the security and stability of the region . The attack has dealt a blow which we hope is not fatal to the efforts undertaken for the establishment of the zone; it has also poisoned the climate conducive to the cooperation required for the establishment of the zone. It is therefore incumbent upon Israel if it genuinely desires to cooperate towards the realization of this objective to produce credible evidence of its goodwill by acceding to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In addition, Israel should declare its readiness to place its nuclear facilities under the IAEA safeguards system and enter into immediate negotiations with the Agency for that purpose. We see no alternative to those steps if Israel wishes to dispel the negative implications of its action and to safeguard the momentum required for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.\n287.\tNotwithstanding the negative aspects to which I have just referred, General Assembly resolution 35/147 on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone which was adopted by a consensus in which all States in the region and the nuclear-weapon States participated should be considered as the starting-point towards the realization of this objective. We therefore consider the time ripe and the conditions appropriate for the present session of the General Assembly to declare the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. The broad outlines of the steps required for the attainment of that objective should also be laid down by the Assembly. The Egyptian delegation will submit a proposal in this regard at the appropriate time , during the present session.\n288.\tEgypt, a country whose history is an intrinsic part of that of Africa, calls for the intensification of the struggle against the apartheid system in South Africa, a regime whose policies pose a serious threat to international peace and security. Therefore, there should be no abrogation of our commitment to fight it. The international community cannot and should not condone the repressive measures undertaken against the national forces in South Africa. Egypt also condemns any collaboration with the Pretoria regime, in particular economic cooperation and cooperation in the field of energy, whatever form it may take. We believe that such cooperation, particularly nuclear cooperation, will make the Pretoria regime persist in its arrogant racist policy and continue to challenge the standards that govern normal relations among nations and peoples. We therefore call for the effective implementation of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.\n289.\tEgypt participates fully in the struggle for the total liberation of southern Africa. My country was a bulwark of the struggle in all its stages and will continue to make available all its capabilities to sustain it until its final victory. We therefore condemn the continuous threat and acts of aggression perpetrated by South Africa against the fraternal African front-line States, the most recent ruthless attack being that against Angola. That South African policy poses a serious threat to international peace and security as well as to the independence, sovereignty and security of the front-line States and their peoples.\n290.\tThe problem of Namibia continues to be a serious and. dangerous one. This is so in spite of the fact that the international community has unanimously agreed to its peaceful solution and despite the wisdom displayed; by SWAPO and the African countries in accepting Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and committing themselves to its implementation. With the help of a handful of countries, South Africa continues by all means to evade committing itself to the implementation of that resolution and continues to buy time in order to persist in its subjugation and exploitation of the people of Namibia, in violation of the principles of justice and legitimacy.\n291.\tThe failure of the Security Council to force South Africa to implement the settlement plan which the Council endorsed in its resolution 435 (1978) and solve the question places on the five Western countries, authors of that plan, increased responsibility to subordinate their immediate interests to the implementation of the plan, which is, after all, the product of their own efforts. In the absence of such an attitude on the part of the five Western countries the situation will explode, not only threatening the interests of all but also endangering the existing international political system.\n292.\tThe continuation of the problem of Namibia poses a serious threat to international peace and security and could provoke further bloodletting in southern Africa, as clearly manifested in the invasion of Angola by South Africa's troops last month an action condemned by all countries and forums. It was therefore appropriate for the emergency special session of the General Assembly which adjourned only a few days ago to call for the imposition of sanctions against South Africa. Egypt calls upon all countries to implement such sanctions in order to completely isolate the racist regime in South Africa.\n293.\tEgypt reiterates its position that the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia, as approved by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978), sets forth complete, defined and acceptable elements for the solution of the Namibian problem. Any attempt to deviate from the plan or to dilute its provisions constitutes an affront to Africa and a violation of the rights of all its peoples and should therefore be resisted by us and immediately and unambiguously condemned. Egypt condemns any attempt to obstruct the implementation of the United Nations plan, and reaffirms once again its total support for the people of Namibia in their struggle to exercise sovereignty over their entire territory, including Walvis Bay, and to gain independence and their natural right to freedom under the leadership of their legitimate representative SWAPO.\n294.\tIn concluding my remarks on the situation in Africa, I wish to reaffirm Egypt's condemnation of any action that threatens peace and security in Africa, particularly the threats emanating from the nuclear activities of South Africa and its nuclear cooperation with a number of States. In 1964, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity adopted the declaration on the De-nuclearization of Africa.8 That historic .Declaration, which represents a constructive step on. the road to peace and general and complete disarmament, cannot bear results at a time when racist South Africa and those who collaborate with it pose a nuclear threat to the security of Africa and its people.\n295 Within the context of the consideration of the security of Africa and the Middle East two areas which represent an important part of the third world\u2014Egypt wishes to express its deep concern at the growing foreign military presence resulting from superPower rivalry in the contiguous Indian Ocean area a development that resulted in the clear deterioration of the security climate of the entire region, which includes West Asia, the waters of the Indian Ocean up to the shores of East Africa, and the southern and eastern boundaries of the Middle East. Egypt therefore supports the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean region and to that end welcomes the convening of an international conference in Sri Lanka, in accordance with the stated position of the nonaligned countries.\n296.\tWithin the context of our consideration of peace and its consolidation, we wish to reaffirm once again the importance that Egypt attaches to the implementation of United Nations resolutions relevant to the national aspiration of the Korean people to unity through negotiation and dialog.\n297.\tAt the outset of my statement I referred to what has befallen the sister State of Afghanistan. In this connection, I wish to confirm our longstanding position on the need for a speedy end to this crucial problem. The continuation of foreign military intervention in the internal affairs of the people of Afghanistan constitutes a flagrant violation by a superPower of the sovereignty and independence of a small nonaligned country. Two years have elapsed since the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. It is time for all foreign troops to withdraw, so that our brother people of Afghanistan can regain their freedom and independence, and exercise their indisputable right to choose their own system of government and their representatives.\n298.\tEgypt supports and actively participates in the efforts to achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international control, particularly in view of the recent escalation and intensification of the arms race. Efforts aimed at arms limitation and control, as well as disarmament, proceed at a snail's pace and thus generate only meagre results that do not correspond to the desire and effort of the peoples of the world to move towards the objective of general and complete disarmament.\n299.\tAgainst this background, the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament acquires a special significance. It is the responsibility of the international community to undertake practical and effective measures to arrest the arms race, both in its nuclear and conventional aspects. In parallel with disarmament measures, there should be other measures to strengthen international peace and security, such as confidence-building measures and resolution of international and regional problems in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rights of peoples to self-determination. Clearly, progress in disarmament cannot be realized in a vacuum. The second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament presents an excellent opportunity that should be fully utilized in order to proceed in an effective and constructive manner towards the realization of disarmament according to agreed timetables and specified phases. This endeavor must be undertaken against the realization that the world sustains billions of people who long for just peace and security, which in turn cannot be realized unless goodwill and possibilities for development exist. Disarmament can effectively Contribute towards this end.\n300. The peace and prosperity of the world are what we all wish for. The poor, the sick and the hungry, who constitute the majority of our present world, are not ready to listen to, let alone to be convinced of, what is propagated about strategies of hegemony, expansionism, domination and doctrines of deterrence, as long as they continue to feel neglected, oppressed and discriminated against, on the pretext that they do not understand and have nothing to do with what is happening.\n301. To bring the world closer to peace and away from the brink of destruction and disaster, we must arm ourselves\nwith reason and unite ourselves against racism, exploitation and occupation, and for justice, peace and right.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. VicePresident, will you please congratulate President Kittani on his election as President of this Assembly. His long and distinguished service to the international community makes him eminently qualified for that task, and I know that he will guide us with impartiality and skill.\n42.\tIt is a great pleasure to welcome two fellow members of the Commonwealth, Belize and Vanuatu, to this assembly of nations. We are especially gratified that independence has brought one more into the growing family of South Pacific island nations. Their voices, individually and collectively, are going to be heard more and more in the world assembly. The addition to our membership of two more small nations, proud of their independence but limited in resources, brings home to us one of the major issues facing this Assembly the desperate struggle of so many countries simply to reach the most basic level of economic and social development.\n43.\tThe recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries sharply focused international attention on this issue. That was useful, but in concentrating on the need for developed countries to raise the level of their official development assistance to a limited number of the poorest developing countries the Conference did not really get to the heart of the matter.\n44.\tThe problems which face the developing countries are well known. They affect some of the developed countries also. They include the soaring cost of imported energy, inflated prices for manufactured imports and fluctuating prices for primary exports. These factors are compounded by increasing protectionist pressures in the advanced economies and a reluctance to contemplate the kind of restructuring which would expand trading opportunities for the developing countries.\t^\n45.\tThese problems cannot be solved by financial subsidies alone or even, in itself, by successful internal economic development. Economic self-sufficiency is not a practicable goal for the developing countries, nor is it for most developed countries. Even a modest level of prosperity and economic stability can only be achieved through a continuous expansion of international trade. This, in turn, can only be achieved in a different international climate, in which there is a better balance between access to manufactured goods and access to agricultural products. There is too great a tendency to concentrate on reducing barriers to trade in industrial manufactures and to push aside agriculture as some kind of an exception with which it is too difficult to cope. That cannot be allowed to continue.\n46.\tIt is, surely, self-evident that successful economic development merely creates new problems unless there is a corresponding expansion of trading opportunities. What future is there if the rich countries continue to deny access in order to protect their own agricultures, if prices of agricultural exports fluctuate wildly or are distorted by subsidies and if those prices are far outstripped by the cost of essential industrial goods and services?\n47.\tThe prosperity of my own country depends on the exp<M of a relatively small number of agricultural commodities. That means we share some of the problems faced by developing countries. We know what those problems are. Because we are small, and because we face economic difficulties ourselves, we try in a number of ways to ensure that our development assistance program is efficient and effective. All our aid is given in the form of grants. We make sure it is directed into the kind of projects in which New\nZealand has a recognized expertise. We never embark on a project unless it has been specifically asked for by the recipient Government. It makes sense for us to concentrate our aid efforts in the part of the world that we know best, that is, our immediate neighborhood. Almost 70 per cent of our bilateral development assistance is now channeled to the island nations of the South Pacific.\n48.\tIn our view, the criteria for inclusion in the United Nations list of least developed countries are unduly narrow and rigid. Only one South Pacific country, at present, qualifies for inclusion in that list. A number of others, because they suffer from all the disadvantages of extremely small size, isolation and lack of resources, also deserve the special treatment accorded to the least developed. Indeed, if it were not for the level of aid they do receive, we believe they would qualify even under present criteria. I would certainly like to see those criteria revised and made more flexible.\n49.\tBecause their populations are tiny and because of the poverty of their resources, many of the island nations of the South Pacific are going to have a long and hard struggle to become more viable. And yet their very smallness and isolation, which ought to make the world community more responsive to their special circumstances, has caused them to be overlooked by some of the major donors. Thus there is every reason for New Zealand to concentrate its aid efforts in the South Pacific, and we intend to continue that policy.\n50.\tExternal financial assistance, however essential, is not enough in itself to bring about successful development. New Zealand recognizes that the developing island countries need outlets for the goods they produce and has set about meeting that need in a practical manner. Together with Australia, we have joined in a treaty with our neighbors in the South Pacific to give them unrestricted duty-free access, on a nonreciprocal basis, for the great majority of their exports. We have also established an industrial development scheme to promote the growth of the manufacturing sector in the island economies through joint ventures with New Zealand firms. We have given strong support to the establishment of a regional shipping line to ensure that the exports of the island countries reach their markets.\n51.\tI make no boast that what we have achieved has solved the problems of our developing neighbors. Obviously not, since their economies are still for the most part in a precarious state.\n52.\tEconomic and social development can progress smoothly only in conditions of political stability. Recent history has shown how true that is even in countries which are blessed with great natural wealth, and all the more starkly in others which are not. Sometimes the causes of instability have been internal. Too often they have been made far worse by external pressure, intervention or military invasion. At present there is dangerous instability in several widely separated areas of the world, including SouthEast Asia, SouthWest Asia, the Middle East, southern Africa, eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula.\n53.\tIf I refer first to Kampuchea it is because that is the area of tension nearest to my own land; because New Zealand regards itself as a friend of the Association of\nSouthEast Asian Nations [ASEANwhose members are neighbors of Kampuchea, Laos and Viet Nam; and because we believe the continuance of the situation in Kampuchea poses an eventual threat to our own security. External intervention in Kampuchea has been flagrant. There is no excuse for the continued presence of 200,000 Vietnamese troops in that country. New Zealand has consistently urged the need for a political settlement which would free the Kampuchean people from a foreign presence and permit them freely to choose their own Government. Such a settlement would enable Viet Nam to resume its own economic development, free from both the burden of maintaining its military occupation of a neighboring country and its present dependence on a single superPower for economic and military support.\n54.\tNew Zealand cannot and does not condone the past crimes of Pol Pot and his associates. But, as the latest vote on Kampuchea's credentials shows, there is no disposition amongst the majority of Members of this Assembly to replace the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea by one representing a puppet Government propped up by a military occupation.\n55.\tWe welcome the efforts that are being made to form a more broadly based successor to the present Democratic Kampuchean leadership. We expect that the International Conference on Kampuchea will continue its efforts to find a solution to the Kampuchean problem a solution which takes account of the legitimate interests of all sides. We hope that Viet Nam and the Soviet . Union will be persuaded to join in the negotiating process through the mediating efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee and the President of the Conference. The need for a settlement is urgent, for the longer the fighting continues' within Kampuchea, the greater the risk that it will spread beyond the borders of that war-torn land.\n56.\tInstability in SouthEast Asia is paralleled in SouthWest Asia by military intervention and continuing hostilities in Afghanistan. International concern will continue to be reiterated in this Assembly until Soviet forces are withdrawn. Whether or not the Soviet Union has come to regard that entanglement as a mistake, my Government most earnestly hopes that the Soviet Government will not compound that error and deal a final fatal blow to detente by similar action against the people of Poland.\n57.\tAlmost since it began, this Organization has been trying to find a solution to the problem of a divided Korea. Yet there is still no genuine dialog between the leaders in the North and those in the South. The latest call by the Republic of Korea for a summit meeting between the two Koreas has been rejected. Surely the Korean people as a whole at least deserve that their leaders should talk seriously about the future of their country. It makes no sense for the two sides in that divided peninsula to go on forever pouring so much of their resources and energies into military preparations. My Government hopes that the authorities in the North will reconsider their stand.\n58.\tIt is a matter of deep regret that all our hopes for urgent and positive steps towards a just and durable Middle East settlement should have had so little to sustain them. New Zealand welcomed the steps agreed upon by Israel and Egypt to restore peace between them. But the process cannot be allowed to come to a stop at this point.\nDuring the last 12 months there has been a deplorable readiness to resort to violence. There is a need for a genuine and renewed commitment to the principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). There is a need for Israel's neighbors to accept and respect the existence of Israel as a sovereign and independent State. There is an equal need for a corresponding recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians, including the right to self-determination. That, in our view, means the right to establish a separate State if that is their wish. The annexation of East Jerusalem and the continuing establishment of settlements in the occupied territories are obstructions to a negotiated settlement. A resurgence of terrorism, a buildup of ever more sophisticated armaments, or recourse to preemptive military strikes simply threaten to undermine what has with such difficulty been accomplished so far. Only a genuine will to negotiate fairly and realistically will bring lasting results.\n59.\tIn southern Africa we still see a people denied the right of nationhood. South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia must end. The Prime Minister of my country said in this forum at the \nthirty-fifth session [109th meeting] that there was no good reason why the few issues that remain outstanding in the search for a settlement in Namibia should not be .settled quickly. We believe that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provides the basis for that settlement and we support the continuing efforts of those seeking to achieve the early and peaceful independence of Namibia.\n60.\tWe deplore South Africa's aggressiveness against its neighbors and its violation of Angola's territory and sovereignty. In South Africa itself the detestable system of institutionalized racism and injustice apartheid remains entrenched. South Africa's black majority are denied the right to participate in the choice of their Government and are shut out from the full enjoyment of the resources of their own country.\n61.\tChange in South Africa is inevitable. Whether it will come peacefully or through violence is in South Africa's hands. Time, though, is running desperately short.\n62.\tWe cannot expect international cooperation in bringing about economic and social development to flourish while confrontation and conflict persist in so many parts of the world. Heightened tension threatens not only detente but the orderly development of international law, the negotiation of arms control agreements and the promotion of human rights. ^National security and rearmament become matters of overriding priority for Governments. Legislatures tend to focus more determinedly on domestic political considerations, to the detriment of enlightened foreign policies. The humanitarian and altruistic instincts of ordinary people all too often become dulled. Their natural instinct for peace is overshadowed by a narrower and more belligerent patriotism. Thus is created an international climate inimical to the peaceful settlement of disputes and the orderly conduct of international relations.\n63.\tAll those who have traditionally cherished the rule of law and the fundamental freedoms, of the individual, both at home and abroad, surely have a special duty to resist such dangerous trends and to throw their weight behind the negotiating process by which the United Nations seeks to achieve those objectives.\n64.\tA prime example is the development of a new law of the sea. A stable order for the oceans, the seabed and coastal waters is essential for world peace. It is most desirable, to say the least, that the major maritime Powers should participate in the new convention. This year the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been slowed down to permit a review of the draft convention by the United States Government. The Conference is now clearly determined to push on to finality in 1982. It is the earnest hope of my Government that, having completed its review, the United States will rejoin the negotiating process and will stand ready with all other nations to make a determined last effort to ensure the adoption by consensus of the draft convention at the next and final negotiating session of the Conference.\n65.\tIn the field of human rights, the United Nations has concentrated, rightly, on the needs of people who are socially disadvantaged or who have been traditional victims of discrimination.\n66.\tA striking example is the United Nations Decade for Women, now at midpoint. The adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women [General Assembly resolution 34/180] has been one of its major achievements. It is significant that it has come into force so quickly. All nations, whatever their stage of economic development, their cultural traditions or their geographic circumstances, have been reminded not only of the rights of half of humanity but also of the enormous contribution made by women. It was right that the United Nations should lead that world movement, because the discrimination to be eliminated  the discrimination we must \\\"eliminate has been universal. The activities of the Decade have been followed with close attention in New Zealand and its aims have our full support. But the convention will only achieve its aim if it is universally ratified and, more important, given full effect in each country.\n67.\tSimilarly, the current International Year of Disabled Persons has focused attention on the rights of handicapped people. It has provided impetus and the practical framework for action. In my own country, the response has been quite remarkable. A mass fund-raising effort for the disabled resulted in the largest collection of voluntary funds for a charitable purpose in our history. We have been made more aware than ever before not only of the needs of the disabled, but of the contribution they can make to our society as a whole.\n68.\tNext year we shall be summoned to the second special session devoted to disarmament. Nowhere is the need for a renewed effort to achieve progress in international negotiations more apparent. If we are honest, we must acknowledge that since the first special session the prospects for effective disarmament measures have not advanced. Indeed, they may have receded. Much of the work of the first session has been undercut by the deterioration in the international climate and in relations among the nuclear Powers. I do not consider it unfair to assign to those Powers the principle responsibility for that loss of impetus and to demand that they take the initiative in resuming serious and active negotiations. It is they who have the weapons which, by universal agreement, are the most dangerous and in most urgent need of control and numerical reduction. My delegation's keenest disappointment is that the negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, a step which could serve to check both horizontal and vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons, still hangs fire.\n\n69.\tOnly the nuclear Powers can negotiate a test-ban treaty which will work or, for that matter, any agreement designed to reduce the threat of nuclear destruction. But the remaining Members of the United Nations have a duty to their peoples to renew their pressure on the nuclear Powers, who are also the largest manufacturers and purveyors of conventional armaments, to resume movement towards disarmament. In that regard, we welcome the decision of the two principal nuclear Powers to resume discussions on the reduction of nuclear weapons in the European theater.\n70.\tI referred earlier to some of the obstacles in the path of economic progress, especially for developing countries. There is no greater corisumer of development resources than the armaments industry, and none that is more wasteful. We must never lose patience in pursuing international agreements which will cut the burden and the danger of rearmament and strengthen the fragile fabric of peace.\n71.\tIt is natural that each of us should seek to advance the interests of his own country, that we should work for the wellbeing of our own people. National pride and patriotism are admirable and necessary virtues. But every coin, every medallion, has another side. Nationalism and pride of country are not in themselves enough. All of us North and South, committed and uncommitted, East and West belong to one world. We have got to work together. Our world has become too small and too dangerous a place for any of us to pursue narrow nationalism regardless of the interests of others.\n72.\tWe must move the world community away from the dangerous road it has been following: that is, the course of rivalry, confrontation and the naked struggle for power. It can lead only to conflict. We must learn, more than ever before, to couple national pride with a real commitment to international cooperation. There is, I believe, no other way to move ahead, to achieve a decent life for all our people. That, I suggest, is why we are meeting here. For all our peoples, whether our countries are large or small, have an equal right td peace, progress and justice.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\nAt the outset my delegation joins, previous speakers in extending to the President our congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. With his vast experience and diplomatic skills he will ably lead us throughout his term. I should also like to extend our profound gratitude to his predecessor for the skillful and excellent manner in which he conducted the business of the last session.\n157.\tOn 15 September the General Assembly witnessed a momentous occasion, which marked the admission of the Republic of Vanuatu to the United Nations. It was a historic ind joyous occasion, especially for those of us from the South Pacific. With great pride and pleasure, Papua New Guinea welcomes Vanuatu as the one hundred and fifty-fifth Member of the United Nations. Its joining this body is significant, because it adds to the small but growing community of South Pacific countries in the United Nations. We sincerely hope that Vanuatu will not be the last, and look forward to more of our neighbors in the South Pacific joining us.\n158.\tOn behalf of my Government, I should also like to extend our warm congratulations' to Mr. Walter Lini, Prime Minister of Vanuatu, and his people on their achievement. It is to their credit that through their skill and dedication Vanuatu was able to withstand some trying times at independence and establish a strong and stable Government. Vanuatu has been independent for just over 12 months. During that period it has taken giant steps in nation-building and has become a strong voice in regional affairs. We wish Vanuatu all success and look forward to working closely with its Government on many global issues, both in this forum and elsewhere.\n159.\tThe pursuit of international peace and security is the most fundamental task of the United Nations. When peace is threatened, all other development initiatives of this body temporarily cease tc be important. Peace and harmony among nations is the greatest catalyst for developing an equitable international community, where any nation, no matter how large or small, how impoverished or wealthy, can fruitfully seek to improve the lives of its people.\n160.\tToday we are witnessing a destabilization of international security brought about by territorial greed and ideological ambition. The haves are taking from the have nots. Whole countries are being swallowed up. Tension grows between the superPowers, bringing the world closer to the brink of nuclear confrontation. These tensions have affected and will continue to affect the majority of the world's population, the innocent bystanders, who have not contributed, and may not contribute, to these rivalries.\n161.\tFaced with this prospect, we think it timely and indeed necessary to appeal to the superPowers and those nations with a nuclear strike capability to weigh again the enormous responsibility that they carry for world peace.\n162.\tDisarmament, as a realistic avenue to peace, does not seem to have achieved any positive results. As of today there has been no meaningful reduction in the manufacture, stockpiling and strategic positioning of intercontinental nuclear weapons.\n\u25a0 .9\n163.\tThe arms race, rather than being reversed or slowed, is escalating to new peaks of sophistication and destructive force, in both its conventional and nucbar aspects. Added to this already alarming situation is the production and stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons. Recent press reports indicating the use of toxic chemical weapons in SouthEast Asia and Afghanistan are even more alarming. The use of such weapons is a flagrant violation of relevant international conventions prohibiting theg use.\n164.\tMy delegation is dismayed by these developments and believes that there must be a point at which reason triumphs over suspicion where a common threat to mankind is honestly acknowledged and nations of influence resolve to redress this position with single-minded purpose.\n165.\tIn this respect, we urge the United States and the Soviet Union to approach future Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with a greater determination to achieve tangible gains for mankind. As two of the most powerful nations, they have a correspondingly sizable obligation to ensure that peace and global stability are not compromised for purely strategic gains.\n166.\tMy delegation wishes also to draw attention once again to the enormous annual global expenditures on arms and defense. As a third world country facing a difficult economic decade, Papua New Guinea sympathizes with the least developed countries which have yet to overcome the far more basic problems of feeding and providing adequate health care for their people.\n167.\tMy delegation believes it is time that defense and the nuclear arms race were looked at in a proper humanitarian perspective. While nations arm in the name of providing a deterrent to conflict so that lives may be saved, malnutrition, disease, floods and famine are claiming millions of lives that could otherwise have been saved with a little more humanitarian concern by the wealthy nations.\n168.\tIt is Papua New Guinea's intention to accede to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [General Assembly resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. We believe that efforts to curb the threat of nuclear warfare can be achieved by increasing collectively the desire of States Members of the United Nations which are concerned with the blatant misuse of nuclear technology.\n169.\tOne aspect of this abuse of technology which is of great concern to Papua New Guinea and other Pacific States is the continued testing of nuclear weapons in our region and proposals by other States to conduct experimental dumping of nuclear waste in our waters. I specifically refer here to France's testing of nuclear weapons at Moruroa Atoll and the intention of the United States and Japan to dump nuclear waste.\n170.\tBy their own admission these countries have said that these tests are experimental. The aftereffects are not known and nobody can say with certainty what the long term effects will be on our peaceful region. Papua New Guinea is distressed by these developments and wishes to make clear that the actions of France and the stated intentions of the United States and Japan are morally wrong and a breach of accepted international conduct,\n171.\tI repeat Papua New Guinea's position that, if these nations wish to conduct dangerous tests, they should do so within their own territorial areas. The Pacific Island States will not continue to tolerate abuses of this sort. Our peoples have a far greater affinity with the land and sea than peoples of the industrialized nations. To jeopardize these assets, which are the sources of our livelihood, can lead only to a straining of relations and rising antagonism.\n172.\tI should now like to turn to the issue of decolonization and to reiterate Papua New Guinea's strong support for the principles of free determination of all peoples. We believe that colonialism is a thing of the past and that the remaining NonSelfGoverning Territories should be granted their inalienable right to chart their own destiny, as stated in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). In this respect we wish to draw, the Assembly's attention to the position adopted by the Twelfth South Pacific Forum, meeting in Vanuatu last month, which reaffirmed our belief in the principles of self-determination and independence applying to non-self-governing Pacific island countries, including the French territories. Further, the South Pacific Forum decided to consult with the French President on the evolution of the new French Government's policy with respect to progress towards decolonization of the people of the French Pacific territories.\n173.\tPapua New Guinea is particularly worried by the possible ramifications should France decide not to create a climate that will ensure that the people of New Caledonia are given the right to choose their own destiny. We sense that a continuation of the status quo will exacerbate the growing frustration and tension of the ethnic Melane sian population which could lead to instability, not only in New Caledonia itself but throughout the South Pacific region.\n174.\tPapua New Guinea will also continue to support decolonization in other parts of the world.\n175.\tThe situation in Namibia continues to cause grave concern to my country. Even though we are far from the shores of Africa, we wholeheartedly support the movement in Namibia to free that Territory from the yoke of colonization by the racist regime in Pretoria. The Government of South Africa has no legitimate or even moral right to be in Namibia. The International Court of Justice has said so, as has the world community, which continues to say so. The South African Government also continues to ignore the people of Namibia as they cry out for freedom. The Organization has proposed peaceful means to resolve this dilemma in the form of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Even though the South African regime was amenable to that resolution and seemed to have been prepared to accept it, it suddenly made an about face early this year. We question the true intentions and motives of the South African Government. Are they sincere or are they merely playing games? They fooled the United Nations and even the contact group. Despite the reversal of the South African position, some Members tell us to exercise moderation in order to entice South Africa back to its 1978 position.\n176.\tWhile we procrastinate, the people of Namibia continue to suffer. How long should such suffering be tolerated? We on the outside cannot, in reality, measure the pain that is being borne by the people of Namibia, a burden that should be removed quickly. There was hope early this year, but that has almost disappeared. In fact, South Africa's recent attitudes and actions seem to us to have jeopardized the last vestige of hope for an early peaceful settlement of the Namibia question. The world must act to assist the people of Namibia in achieving their independence. In fact, this Assembly has acted and continues to do so. The people of Namibia should not lose heart, since an overwhelming majority of the world continues to give them moral support. This is evidenced by the adoption of resolution ES8/2 on 14 September 1981 by the General Assembly. It was supported by 117 Members, including Papua New Guinea; while 25 abstained, no one voted against it. Even though there were some elements which may have caused us to make some reservations in our position, we deliberately refrained from doing so. The situation in Namibia, in our view, has gone beyond the necessity for adhering to our reservations as they apply specifically to Namibia. We now regard Namibia as a special and unique case because of the present unnecessary prolongation of a peaceful settlement.\n177.\tThe continuing conflict in the Middle East has had a profound effect on the international community, and although we are geographically remote from that region we acknowledge the principle of interdependence of nations and support all initiatives to bring about a lasting and equitable solution.\n178.\tWe commend the United Nations for its efforts in attempting to resolve that conflict and urge that those efforts be redoubled as a matter of urgency. It is my delegation's view that the United Nations can play a constructive role and successfully mediate in bringing about a solution. However, we note with grave concern that efforts by the United Nations are threatened by the increasing sale of arms to Middle East States involved in the conflict. We believe that continued arms sales can only prolong the crisis and cause further division between the parties in conflict.\n179.\tEfforts such as the Camp David agreements which aim to provide a basis for comprehensive and lasting settlement receive Papua New Guinea's support. We are mindful of other efforts towards peace in the region, and they too receive our endorsement.\n180.\tI mentioned earlier Papua New Guinea's total and unqualified opposition to manipulation and interference in the affairs of small, underdeveloped States by nations possessing superior military and economic resources.\n181: The most blatant examples of unprovoked aggression have occurred in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, where puppet Governments supported by foreign military forces have been installed. Papua New Guinea does riot recognize either Government. We believe that the situation in Afghanistan cannot be normalized while Soviet troops continue to occupy parts of that country.\n182.\tIn this regard, Papua New Guinea supports the efforts of the European Council to convene an international conference aimed at bringing all parties to the conflict together for negotiations. We also support initiatives to arrange talks between Afghanistan and neighboring States.\n183.\tWe note that the Soviet Union has not responded to a United Nations resolution calling for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. The Soviet Union's act of unprovoked aggression and its arrogant disregard of world opinion constitute a serious violation of international law and pose a marked threat to world peace and stability.\n184.\tSimilarly, Papua New Guinea continues to deplore the intervention of foreign forces in Kampuchea and will maintain its position of not recognizing Heng Samrin regime installed by the Vietnamese.\n185.\tWe commend the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral, under General Assembly resolution 35/6, in hosting the recent International Conference on Kampuchea in July this year and we support the Declaration of that Conference.13 My delegation believes that that Declaration embodies the prerequisites for a negotiated settlement in Kampuchea.\n186.\tI should also like to commend recent efforts by the members of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN] to unite the Khmer factions in their struggle to liberate Kampuchea from Viet Nam. The recent meeting of the three main Khmer factions in Singapore was significant. The Joint Statement issued as a result of that meeting [see A/361498] demonstrates the continuing desire and willingness of the Kampucitean people jointly to work towards liberating their homeland from foreign aggression.\n187.\tPapua New Guinea also wishes to reiterate its view that a meaningful and lasting solution in Kampuchea can only be achieved through the total cooperation of Viet Nam, and we strongly urge Viet Nam to adhere to the wishes of the international community as contained in resolution 35/6 and the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea.\n188.\tIn the recent past the international community has realized that the economic welfare of each sovereign nation depends on a network of interdependence. At the same time it has noted that there is a widening gap between developed and developing countries on many economic issues. The new international economic order, when it was mooted in 1974 [see General Assembly resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)], was intended to find ways and means to rectify the imbalance in economic conditions. The Government of Papua New Guinea is concerned that the progress being made in achieving the objective of a new international economic order has so far been slow.\n189.\tThe efforts that have been made at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to bring about an equitable international economic order or changes in the existing world economic system have my delegation's support.\n190.\tPapua New Guinea is appreciative of the progress being made through UNCTAD in achieving the objectives of. an integrated Program for commodities, particularly the arrangements on. the Common Fund for Commodities and individual international commodities.\n191.\tMy delegation supports efforts by the international community to bring about a new structure to regulate trade ii? primary commodities with a view to achieving price levels which are remunerative for producers and equitable for consumers.\n192.\tThe Lome Convention has assisted Papua New Guinea greatly in areas such as access to funds and technical expertise from the European Community countries to help implement development projects. Although Papua New Guinea's major export commodities have duty-free access to the markets of the European Community, my delegation has '\\\"noted that the original purpose of the Lome arrangement to secure more balanced and fairer trade has yet to be achieved.\n193.\tWe note with interest the set of concrete recommendations for a Program of action in several key areas of restructuring the international economy contained in the Brandt Commission report.14 The report is complementary to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Pearson report is sponsored by the World Bank. The significance of the Brandt report is based on the emphasis it places on mutuality of interest. The report is consistent with the decisions of the fourth session of UNCTAD and the new international economic order in that it calls for the restructuring of the international economic system so as to ensure a greater flow of benefits to developing countries. In addition, the report emphasizes the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers, which Papua New Guinea believes is a prerequisite for improving terms of trade for both developed and develop^ ing countries.\n194.\tAs a developing country, Papua New Guinea supports the recommendations of the Brandt Commission report, in particular those covering trade and development finance.\n195.\tWe note that most codes or agreements on non tariff measures that have been concluded are now in force, yet some developed countries have not applied them. Despite the marked^ achievements in multilateral trade negotiations, developing countries continue to face undue restrictions in developed market economies.\n196.\tMy delegation notes with dismay that in international economic relations increasing protectionist tendencies are shown by developed countries. Most industrialized countries maintain comparatively low average tariff levels, yet some individual tariffs remain high, especially for products of export interest to developing countries. Papua New Guinea opposes protectionism and supports the efforts made in multilateral trade negotiations to achieve freer world trade.\n197.\tMy delegation would like, to see the implementation of the various plans of action proposed by the United Nations and its agencies. The Lima Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Cooperation and related new international economic order proposals for a substantial acceleration in the industrialization of the developing countries clearly imply major structural shifts in the patterns of world production and trade in manufactured goods. In particular, a rapid increase in industrial capacity and in the availability of manufactured goods for export from developing countries would requite a restructuring of the industrial sector of developed countries to accommodate a large expansion in imports from developing countries.\n198.\tAlthough Papua New Guinea does not have a large manufacturing sector, we support the Lima Plan of Action and hope that in implementing that Plan the rural needs and aspirations of the developing countries will be given due consideration.\n199.\tPapua New Guinea also supports the principle of economic cooperation among developing countries. We have become a member of various regional groupings and of a selected number of United Nations specialized agencies in an attempt to achieve our aims.\n200.\tIt should be remembered that the slow progress in achieving the aims of economic cooperation among developing countries has been the direct or indirect result of the negative attitude shown by industrialized nations. For example, during the 1970s and early 1960s the issue of decolonization was the major concern of the emerging States. Political currents at the time had induced third world countries to adopt positions of confrontation towards industrialized nations. As a result very little or no effort was directed towards meaningful cooperation in the fields of economic and social development. In this connection my delegation believes that a positive attitude by developed and developing countries in playing their part in development issues will pave the way to achievement of the aims of a new international economic order.\n201.\tI should now like to make a brief reference to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has been meeting since 1974. The objective of the Conference is to produce a universally accepted convention that will govern the uses of the sea and its resources.\n202.\tHowever, we are disappointed that the Conference was not able to implement the Program of work which it adopted during the second half of the ninth session at Geneva in August last year and which called for the conclusion of the Conference and adoption of a convention during the tenth session in MarchApril 1981. The delay in the conclusion of the work of the Conference and the adoption of a convention has been caused by the United States Government's desire to review certain provisions of the draft convention. It is my delegation's hope that the United States Government's review will not call for renegotiations on provisions that have already been agreed upon by the Conference. To do so would jeopardize the results achieved so far through the painstaking negotiations over the past decade and prevent the early adoption of a convention on the law of the sea. My delegation therefore supports the early conclusion and adoption of a convention on the law of the sea by the end of the eleventh session, which is to be held in New York during MarchApril 1982., The convention should be open for signature in Caracas in the autumn of the same year.\n203.\tI have touched upon only some of the issues that beset the world today. These problems, in my Government's view, are serious. They must be solved. It is our duty to solve them. No other people will do that for us. But to do so, we must be practical and realistic. We must cooperate with each other to the fullest extent. If we do not, these problems will increase to the point where it will be too late to find solutions to them.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "3.\tThe death of the President of Egypt, Anwar El Sadat, is another tragic event that again brings to the forefront the urgent need to contribute to the quest for a real solution to the Middle East question which once and for all will put an end to the violence that besets the brother peoples of the Arab world.\n4.\tMankind is living through a crucial moment in its history as a result of the great tensions that today more than ever threaten peace. Nicaragua has deemed it timely and necessary to bring to the Assembly, inter alia, a number of specific proposals which could contribute to the cause of peace in the world.\n5.\tWe are today the bearers of a specific proposal in our search for a rational way out of the profound crisis affecting the Central American area, the most critical point of which is El Salvador. This is the main reason for our presence in the Assembly, where we are certain we shall meet with the favorable reception warranted by the serious circumstances of the moment.\n6.\tWe are the bearers of a specific proposal which could assist Central America in its struggle for peace, at the very moment when that peace is disrupted by the escalation of the arms race in the world, with thousands of millions of dollars being invested in the production kid emplacement of medium-range missiles, rockets, neutron bombs, and so on; at the very moment when the progress achieved on strategic arms limitations agreements, SALT II, is being seriously jeopardized by the hegemonistic policy of the present United States Government.\n7.\tWe are the bearers of a specific proposal which could assist Central America in its struggle for peace, at a time when the racist regime of South Africa is invading Angola, promoting destabilizing actions in Zambia, invading the southern part of Mozambique and training mercenaries to invade Zimbabwe, all with the support of the present United States Government; at a time when Libya is the victim of provocations arising from United States policy which have even led to two aircraft of the Libyan Air Force being shot down over its own territorial space in the Gulf of Sidra.\n8.\tWe are the bearers of a specific proposal by which Central America could contribute to the cause of peace, at a time when the Government of Israel, with the full support of the United States, is carrying out acts of terrorism against the Palestinian people and against the Lebanese people, murdering hundreds, as well as bombing the Tamuz nuclear research center in Iraq.\n9.\tWe are the bearers of a specific proposal which in Central America could contribute to the cause of peace, at a time when there is an increase in spying flights by United States aircraft in the airspace of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and the economic blockade and political and military threats against Cuba, and the occupation of Guantanamo, continue; at a time when the people of Grenada is harassed and attacked, at a time when the implementation of the treaties concerning the Panama Canal Zone, for which General Omar Torrijos fought and died, is placed in jeopardy; at a time when resolutions of the United Nations concerning the independence of Namibia are flouted.\n10.\tWe bring a specific proposal which could assist Central America in its struggle for peace, at a time when the enemies of peace brandish philosophical concepts to justify their warlike nature, while at the same time perpetrating acts of aggression.\n11.\tThat is why today we also wish to contribute to the cause of peace by condemning the South African regime, expressing our solidarity with the peoples attacked by that regime, expressing our solidarity with the patriots of the South West Africa People's Organization [,SWAPO] as the sole legitimate representatives of Namibia; supporting the front-line States; expressing our support and solidarity with Libya and with the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], the sole representative of the Palestinian people;\u2003with the people and Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; with the people and Government of Grenada; with the courageous, united and strong people and Government of revolutionary Cuba; with the struggle of the POLISARIO Front, with the resolution adopted on 20 August 1981 by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, wherein the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence is reaffirmed [A/36/23, chap. I, para. 87]; with the people and Government of Panama; with the people and Government of heroic Viet Nam, while repudiating the policy of punishment and the threat and use of force against that people; with the coastal States of the Indian Ocean which are continuing their struggle to have that area declared a zone of peace and to obtain the consequential withdrawal of the different military fleets moving in the area. We also appeal to the fraternal peoples and Governments of Iran and Iraq to seek a solution in the spirit of the nonaligned movement to the differences or claims that may exist between those two States.\n12.\tFinally, may we once again express our solidarity with the people and Government of Cyprus, with the people of Chile, with the people of Uruguay and with the heroic people of Guatemala.\n13.\tMay we also hail as a victory for peace the independence of the people of Belize and its membership in the Organization.\n14.\tWe bring a specific proposal which in Central America could strengthen the efforts for peace which we are today obliged to make throughout the world, at a time when that peace is also threatened by restrictive economic measures which make their full weight felt in the third world countries, historically exploited by the developed countries.\n15.\tHie latest decisions on the subject made public by the Government of the United States are clear proof of what we have just stated. The Secretary of the Treasury of the present United States Administration said the Government intends to limit loans and credits to developing countries through IMF and the World Bank; and President Reagan himself, at the annual meeting of the Boards of Governors of the IMF and the World Bank, confirmed that decision, saying that for the poor countries the only magic formula is that of the free market, a \\\"magic formula\\\" which has served only to make our countries poorer.\n16.\tDespite the efforts made by the third world countries to restructure their foreign debt and, by means of great sacrifices, to pay the servicing costs, the economic horizon is now so bleak that it compels us to serious reflection. Unless formulas in keeping with the economic realities of our countries are devised, there will be no way out except to cancel the whole of the external debt and its servicing costs, or the time will come when by common agreement we, the poor countries of the world, will have to say that we are not going to pay because we cannot pay, because we have nothing to pay with. We cannot forget that in external debt servicing alone the developing countries must pay with blood and sweat more than $40 billion a year, without the least possibility of finding a solution to their economic problems. On the contrary, the position is becoming more and more serious.\n17.\tWho can overlook the fact that the price of products that we export declines all the time while the costs of production of those products increase because the spare parts, machinery, equipment and so on become dearer each day?\n18.\tIn 1977 our countries had to produce 338 quintals of cotton, 1,394 quintals of sugar or 98 quintals of coffee to buy one tractor. Four years later, in 1981, we must produce 476 quintals of cotton an increase of 41 per cent to buy one tractor; or 2,143 quintals of sugar an increase of 54 per cent or more; or 248 quintals of coffee an increase of 145 per cent. That is because the wealthy countries lend us money on hard terms, sell more expensively each day, but buy each day at a lower price.\n19.\tAs a result of these unfair international terms of trade and of the profound injustices engendered by exploitation, a dramatic social, economic and political crisis today shakes Central America. That crisis stems from the depths of the misery of 20 million Central American men and women.\n20.\tIn 1979 one in two 15-year-old Central Americans was illiterate. One out of eight children died before the age of one. Three out of every 10 Central Americans looking for employment did not find it. Twelve million people lived without proper housing. For every dollar obtained by a poor Central American a rich man received $48. According to recent studies by ECLA, 8.5 million Central Americans live in conditions of extreme poverty.\n21.\tIt is there, in the old reality of the exploitation of the Central American countries and in the injustice with which the developed world treats our peoples, that we must seek the causes of the political and social unrest that is today shaking Central America not in the Nicaraguan revolution, which is the first great historic attempt in Central America to eliminate the roots of the crisis.\n22.\tThe \\\"accusation\\\" leveled at the Sandinist People's Revolution that it is the cause of rebellion in Central America lays bare the hypocrisy of those who are truly responsible for the dramatic Central American situation. The beginning of any solution to the crisis in the region lies in recognizing that that crisis is the product of the exploitation to which the Central American countries have been subjected and in developing a set of measures in keeping with that reality.\n23.\tBetween 1973 and 1980 Central America's external debt quintupled, and by the end of 1981 it will reach the unprecedented figure of $7 billion. That debt today represents 140 per cent of our exports, when barely three years ago it amounted to 80 per cent. It is an increasing burden placed on the shoulders of Central American workers, because the payment of interest to creditors means that each year a larger proportion of the region's exports must be earmarked for it. The high rates of interest, which obey the fiscal and monetary policy of the United States, punish those who have less and reward those who have more. So long as this situation is not corrected, there can be no solution to the Central American crisis.\n24.\tTo solve its own crisis the United States is applying a policy consisting in raising to unbelievable heights the cost of financial resources obtained by our countries. This logically leads to the export of the United States crisis to the poor countries. This year alone $1.2 billion have drained out of Central America and found highly rewarded refuge in the developed countries.\n25.\tIn the past three years alone the Central American countries have lost $1,235 million, transferred to the developed countries, the United States in particular, because of the deterioration in the purchasing power of their exports. As long as this situation is not reversed, how can our countries develop, how can that crisis be solved? That deterioration in the terms of trade is a veritable tax on our exports levied by the developed countries. Those countries must therefore provide finance to compensate for that deterioration.\n26.\tIn two years 1979 and 1980 the Central American countries lost international reserves amounting to $1,181 million. Where, then, are our countries to And the necessary resources to finance investments to promote development? What is required is a massive flow of concessional resources to finance our strategic energy, transport, infrastructure and industrial and agricultural production projects.\n27.\tWe claim justice as countries that have been impoverished by centuries of exploitation and by those unjust international economic relations, but the United States closes its ears. The forthcoming International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held at Cancun, has already begun to be affected by the refusal of the United States to deal with items that would truly make it possible to deal with the explosive situation in the economic order of the world today, and by its denying Cuba which at present occupies the presidency of the nonaligned movement in a manner that we can only describe as infantile, the right to participate in that meeting.\n28.\tBut Nicaragua is convinced that countries like Mexico, France, Austria, the United Republic of Tanzania, Algeria, India and others will be the standard-bearers and spokesmen in our demands for a new international economic order.\n29.\tWe said that we were bringing from our region specific proposals which could contribute to the cause of peace. We have explained that the fundamental causes of the crisis affecting our area are economic and that they have been brought about by the unjust relations existing in the present economic order and by the overexploitation to which our peoples have been and are subjected by exploiting minorities which serve like eunuchs the interests of international exploitation. If we understand this, we shall also understand why there was a revolution, in Nicaragua and why there is a revolutionary war in El Salvador and another in Guatemala. If we want to find a serious answer to the situation in Central America, we shall have to stop invoking the specter of the EastWest conflict, which is used by those who try to reject any change in the region.\n30.\tWe cannot forget or ignore the fact that all this picture of brutal economic exploitation has been defended throughout our history by aggressive United States policy.\n31.\tAfter the United States war of independence the model of a federal democracy based on ideals of freedom which inspired the struggles of Washington and Jefferson was also the model for the leaders of the independence struggles of Latin America; and in Central America the concept of a liberal federal State headed by General Francisco Morazati was the offspring of those principles of the American Revolution.\n32.\tBut that dream was to die very soon. The emergence of the Monroe Doctrine, \\\"America for the Americans\\\", was to represent the aggressive will of Yankee expansionism on the continent, and from 1840 onwards our peoples were no longer to benefit from the influence of those ideals of democracy and freedom but rather to suffer interference, threats, the imposition of treaties contradictory to the sovereignty of our countries, provocation of war among neighboring States, blackmail with the presence of the United States fleet in our territorial waters, military interventions, the landing of Marines and the imposition of corrupt Governments and one-sided economic treaties. More than 784 acts hostile to the right of our countries to sovereignty have occurred on our continent since that time, and more than 100 of them since 1960.\n33.\tWhy were our countries insulted, invaded and humiliated on more than 200 occasions from 1840 to 1917? Under what pretexts, since at the time there was not a single socialist State in the world and the Tsar ruled over all the Russias? Treaties and loans were imposed on us, we were invaded, we were given the status of protectorates under that same thesis of American national security, which was first called the Monroe Doctrine, then manifest destiny, later the big stick, later dollar diplomacy.\n34.\tThe expansion of frontiers, secure maritime routes, military bases in the Caribbean, bought Governments and docile Governments these were manifestations of a liberal ideal which had become barefaced expansionism.\n35.\tHow can we explain the numerous acts of aggression and interference and the landings that occurred between 1917 and 1954 in Latin America, when there was still no Cuban revolution and Cuba could not be accused of \\\"interference\\\" accusations that were to be reserved for the future?\n36.\tThe United States did not take over Cuba and Puerto Rico in 1898 and impose the Piatt amendment to save Caribbean territories from the influence of the Soviet Union, since the latter was not yet in existence.\n37.\tThe United States did not land Marines in Veracruz, Haiti and Nicaragua, nor did it from 1903 onwards arm the most formidable naval force ever seen in Caribbean waters in order to resolve the EastWest conflict to its own benefit. It was simply defending the interests of its territorial expansionism, the interests of its financiers and its bankers, of those business tycoons who were beginning to beset Latin America.\n38.\tToday, 7 October 1981, the United States is beginning near the sovereign territory of Nicaragua showy military maneuvers called \\\"Halcon Vista\\\", with the participation of its own naval, land and air transport forces together with military contingents from Honduras. At this time, as in 1855 when the freebooter William Walker landed on our shores at the head of a troop of southern mercenaries, our country is threatened by aggression on a scale higher than we have known so far. At this time, as in 1912 when our homeland was invaded by Marines and defended by the patriots led by General Benjamin Zeleddn, a national hero, dangers of further invasions of Nicaragua, whether direct or indirect are growing. At this time, as happened in 1927 when we were invaded by the Marines, against whom the army, headed by General Sandino, defended our national sovereignty for six long years of struggle, there are new threats from the present United States Administration. At this time it is necessary to remember the history of aggression against Central American countries throughout more than a century.\n39.\t1855: the William Walker freebooters landed in Nicaragua with the purpose of annexing the whole of Central America to the southern states of the United States. Walker proclaimed himself President and restored slavery in Nicaragua. That same year, the colonels in active service, Kinneys and Eabens, proclaimed the \\\"independence\\\" of San Juan del Norte, a sovereign territory of Nicaragua. 1856: Through the DallasClarendon Treaty, the United States \\\"ceded\\\" to England the Territory of Belize, which did not belong to it. 1860: The United States intervened for the first time in Panama, under the pretext of restoring order. 1867: The United States affirmed its \\\"ownership\\\" of Nicaragua through the Dickinson-Ayon Treaty, which gave it the right to build the inter-oceanic canal. 1896: United States military forces landed in Nicaragua, at the port Of Corinto. 1899: More United States military forces landed on our territory, in San Juan del Norte and Blue fields. 1900: The United States imposed on Nicaragua and Costa Rica the Hay-Corea and Hay-Calvo Treaties to acquire control over the canal route through the Central American isthmus. 1901: the Marines landed in the Panama isthmus. 1903: The Marines landed in Puerto Cortes, Honduras. 1904: The Marines landed in Ancon and other points in Panama. That was the year when Theodore Roosevelt elaborated the \\\"Roosevelt corollary\\\" or, rather, the big-stick policy. 1905: A further landing of Marines in Puerto Cortes, Honduras. 1909: The United States intervened in Nicaragua to overthrow the Government of General Jose Santos Zelaya through the infamous \\\"Knox note\\\". 1910: The Marines landed in Corinto, Nicaragua, and attacked our shores until they succeeded in imposing their own oligarchic Government. 1911: The United States again landed its Marines in Corinto, Nicaragua, imposed presidents in Honduras and Nicaragua and compelled Costa Rica and Nicaragua to accept onerous debt consolidations and new loans. 1912: The Marines landed yet again in Honduras, and the United States began its military occupation of Nicaragua which was to last until 1925. 1914: The United States imposed on Nicaragua the shameful ChamorroBryan Treaty, which reduced our sovereign homeland. 1918: The Marines landed in Colon and Chiriqui, Panama. 1919: The Marines occupied Honduran ports to intervene in the electoral process. 1920: The Marines landed in Guatemala on the pretext of safeguarding the life of North American citizens and protecting the legation. 1921: The Marines occupied the region of La Chorrera, Panama. 1924: The Marines landed in Honduras and occupied Tegucigalpa and other cities of the country. 1925: The Marines landed in Honduras and Panama, in both cases to break workers' strikes. 1926: After leaving the country for a very few months, the Marines returned to occupy Nicaragua. That military occupation was to last until 1933, when the Yankee troops were compelled to withdraw in the face of the heroic resistance of the army, the Defender of National Sovereignty, headed by Sandino. 1930: The North American fruit companies promoted frontier Wars and military uprisings, imposed presidents and undermined the national sovereignty of Guatemala, Honduras and Panama. 1954: The United States, through the Central Intelligence Agency [CM], overthrew the Government of General Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala. 1961: The United States military mission directed a coup against a civilian-military junta of a nationalistic character in El Salvador. 1964: United States troops in the Panama Canal Zone attacked a nationalist demonstration and murdered 30 Panamanians. 1972: The United States signed with Colombia the Saccio-Vazquez Carrizosa Treaty, which was harmful to the interests of Nicaragua's sovereignty. In that same year United States forces were taken from the Panama Canal Zone to Managua to safeguard the stability of the Somoza regime after the earthquake that destroyed the city. Early in the 1960s the United States also launched the abortive invasion of Cuba. 1978: The United States attempted to impose a mediation policy in Nicaragua to preserve the system and prevent the triumph of the people's Sandinist movement. 1979: The United States Secretary of State, at the Seventeenth Meeting of Consultation of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States, requested military intervention in Nicaragua to frustrate the Sandinist people's success. American helicopters landed in Costa Rica, in accordance with a plan to interfere in our war of liberation. 1981: The United States sent military advisers, military helicopters and war material to El Salvador and Honduras. It cut loans to our country for development and for the purchase of food by $81.1 million. It allowed the training of former Somoza guards in military camps in the state of Florida. It ratified the Saccio-Vazquez Carrizosa Treaty as an act of provocation against Nicaragua. And it began with Honduras the \\\"Halcon Vista\\\" military maneuvers.\n40. Two days ago Colonel Samuel Dickens, an American officer and a member of the Council of the Inter American Defense Board, stated on arrival in Tegucigalpa that the \\\"Halcon Vista\\\" military maneuvers were but a sample and that the Ignited States was ready to give its support to Honduras in a war against Nicaragua and to attack the people and the Revolutionary Government of Nicaragua. His lack of respect did not stop there. He also attacked the Government or Honduras because it proclaimed that it was neutral vis-a-vis neighbors like Nicaragua and a guerrilla war such as that in El Salvador, He also attacked the Governments of Mexico and France. All this accompanied the arrival in Puerto Cortes on the Atlantic coast of Honduras of the United States amphibian vessel U.S.S. Fort Snelling with 500 Marines, three patrol boats, a tugboat and military material. There also arrived at the same time at San Pedro de Sula, Honduras, two observation aircraft of the United States Air Force coming from the Panama Canal Zone.\n41.\tWhat can we call all this?\n42.\tThe United States continues to try to use Central American territory as it did in the 1960s to attack Cuba now to attack Nicaragua.\n43.\tActs of aggression, interference, pressure and blackmail have never ceased. Respect for the sovereignty of our countries has never been obtained from the United States. The expansionist thinking of the last century, the gunboat treaties, the big-stick policy, have emerged again.\n44.\tIs this the kind of history that will repeat itself in Central America?\n45.\tOur peoples are ready to respond as Sandino did to any attempt at direct or indirect aggression, either in Nicaragua or in El Salvador. We all know that the threat of invasion is directed first and foremost against those two peoples.\n46.\tWill that interventionist policy continue to be imposed on the will of the people of the United States?\n47.\tWill the policy of sustaining, arming and defending in Central America such criminal regimes as those of Carias, Ubico, Hernandez, Martinez and Somoza continue to be imposed? It would appear so, according to the nostalgic words of a representative of the United States who, when passing through Peru, affirmed that she would prefer Somoza in power in Nicaragua rather than the Sandinists.\n48.\tHow far will economic aggression, hand in hand with military aggression, against Nicaragua go? Will the policy of interventionism in Central America again be imposed with impunity? Will the United States continue to promote a wrongheaded policy in Central America, leading to an explosive regional crisis that will make worse an already difficult international situation?\n49.\tWe wish to state yet again our firm position on this question. We want peace, but not at the cost of freedom. We do not want war, but if war is waged against us we shall resist with a people's war. We believe that although the picture is sombre and the outlook threatening, there is still time to stop the warmongers.\n50.\tCentral America demands changes. The revolutionaries and the Central American patriots are promoting those changes, and the Central American peoples are ready to bring them about. The just war being waged by the heroic people of El Salvador demands a true solution, one that cannot be obtained through election^ based on bloodshed, one that cannot be obtained through paramilitary groups, one that cannot be obtained through ever greater intervention by the United States, one that cannot be obtained through genocide.\n51.\tIt is for those reasons that, in our quest above all for a stabilizing solution in the area, the Sandinist Government of Nicaragua applauds the declaration made by Mexico and France on 28 August concerning the search for a political solution in El Salvador through dialog between the belligerents.\n52.\tWe also welcome the resolution on the situation regarding human rights in El Salvador and the possible ways and means of achieving a political solution, adopted at the 68th InterParliamentary Conference, which met at Havana from 15 to 23 September 1981 [see AJ36/584, annex]; the proposed resolution on Central America and the Caribbean put forward by the Socialist International, meeting at Paris in September; and the final declaration of the meeting of intellectuals for the sovereignty of the peoples of our America, held at Havana from 4 to 8 September, which also relates to the struggle of the Salvadorian people.\n53.\tWe said that we were the bearers of a specific proposal to assist Central America in its struggle for peace in the world. That is why today we fulfill the duty demanded of us by historic circumstances and inform you, Mr. President, and the representatives in the Assembly of the nations of the earth of the proposals conveyed to us by the Salvadorian patriots.\n54.\tBut first we should like to say that there is among us, accompanying the delegation of Nicaragua, the President of the Democratic Revolutionary Front of El Salvador and member of the Joint Political Commission of the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and of the Revolutionary Democratic Front, comrade Guillermo Manuel Ungo.\n55.\tThe proposals are dated 4 October 1981 and addressed to Commander of the Revolution Daniel Ortega Saavedra, Coordinator of the Junta Government of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua. They are as follows:\n\\\"The Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Revolutionary Democratic Front authorize you to convey to the thirty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly and to the peoples of the world our proposals concerned with possible peace talks aimed at solving the crisis at present afflicting our country.\n\\\"The following is the text of our proposals:\n\\\" 'The Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Democratic Revolutionary Front address the international community and peoples of the world because they consider the United Nations to be the expression of the principles of peace, justice and equality among States and peoples and therefore the appropriate forum in which to express the aspirations of the people of El Salvador and its representative organizations, the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Revolutionary Democratic Front.\n\\\" 'May we first of all express our gratitude for the many expressions of solidarity with the struggle of\nour people which we have received from Governments, as well as from organizations and political, social and religious personalities, throughout our struggle. We wish especially to express our gratitude to the Governments and peoples of Mexico and France for their solidarity, for they have recognized our organizations as representative political forces. May we also express our thanks for the comments and proposals of most of the countries of the international community in support of a political solution.\n\\\" 'If today our people, directed by the Farabundo Marti Front and the Revolutionary Democratic Front, are involved in armed struggle it is because regimes of oppression and repression have closed the peaceful channels for change, leaving to the people as the sole legitimate alternative in its quest for liberation the recourse armed struggle, die exercise of the universal and constitutional right to resort to rebellion against unlawful and bloodthirsty authority.\n\\\" 'Our way is therefore a just and necessary war to build peace and bring about equality among all Salvadorians.\n\\\" 'However, what we want is peace, and to achieve it we are proposing a political solution the objectives of which would be the end of the war and the establishment of a new economic and political order that will ensure for all Salvadorians the enjoyment of their rights as citizens and a life worthy of human beings.\n\\\" 'All this supports our express will to open a dialog with the civilian and military representatives to be designated by the Junta through a process of peace talks.\n\\\" 'We intend to base those peace talks, which reaffirm our commitment to seek and implement a political solution, on the following general principles:\n\\\" '1. They will be carried out between delegates appointed by the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Revolutionary Democratic Front and representatives of the Government Junta of El Salvador.\nto\n\\\" '2. They will be conducted in the presence of Governments which, as witnesses, will contribute to the solution of the dispute.\n\\\" '3. They will be comprehensive in nature, encompassing the fundamental aspects of the conflict on the basis of an agenda to be drawn up by both sides.\n\\\" '4. The people of El Salvador must be informed of every development.\n\\\" '5. The talks will be opened without either of the two parties establishing prior conditions.\n\\\" 'In an effort to ensure a basis that will bring /about a political solution, the Farabundo Marti Front\nand the Revolutionary Democratic Front express the will to discuss the following points:\n\\\" '(a) The definition of a new political, economic and juridical order which will make possible and encourage the full democratic participation of the various political, social and economic sectors, especially the marginal ones. Elections will be an important element of the mechanism of participation and representation of the population.\n\\\" (b) The restructuring of the armed forces on the base of the officers and men of the present army who are not responsible for crimes of genocide against the people and the integration of the officers and men of the Farabundo Marti Front.\n\\\" 'Our Fronts regard elections as a valid and necessary instrument for the expression of the will of the people, providing there are the necessary conditions and a climate that will enable our citizens freely to express their will. In El Salvador at present the electoral process does not fill those requirements, since the repressive apparatus of the regime which murders trade union and political leaders and activists, persecutes the progressive elements of the church and is daily responsible for the physical elimination of dozens of citizens remains intact. Similarly, martial law and press censorship are still in force, and there has been an increase in the war against the people with the aid of weapons and advisers sent by the Government of the United States.\n\\\" 'A political solution is necessary for our people, for the stability of the region, for peace and security among nations. This means that Governments must scrupulously respect the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of other peoples. That is why we are directly addressing the Government of the United States and asking it to cease its military intervention in El Salvador, since that intervention runs counter to the interests of the Salvadorian and American peoples and endangers peace and security in Central America.\n\\\" 'Our proposal meets the calls for justice in accordance with the purest principles of international law and the interests of the nations and peoples of the world in the quest for a peaceful settlement of the causes of hotbeds of tension. In their efforts the Salvadorian people express their confidence in the understanding, participation and support of the international community in the achievement of their right to peace, freedom and independence.' \\\"\nThe document is signed by the Unified Revolutionary Direction of the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Executive Committee of the Revolutionary Democratic Front.\n56. We are convinced that this appeal for justice, this appeal for peace, will be recognized by all those Governments that are truly concerned with the fundamental rights of mankind. In the name of the dead, in the name of the tortured, in the name of the illiterate, in the name of the hungry, in the name of the exploited, let this initiative not be in vain; let the forces of reason and love, the forces of peace, triumph once again over the irrational forces.\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation joins with others who have spoken before me in congratulating Mr. Kittani on his election to the post of President of the\nthirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His task is not an easy one, but we are confident that his deep and extensive experience in international diplomacy acquits him well for the task before him. My delegation pledges its support to his leadership.\n261.\tI should also like to express my delegation's appreciation of the excellent leadership given to the\nthirty-fifth session of the General Assembly by its President, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany. His record is one of which this Assembly can justifiably be proud and is a credit both to him and to his country.\n262.\tNo amount of congratulations can ever be enough to express our. deep sense of gratitude for the thankless but important job that the SecretaryGeneral and his Secretariat staff are doing. Theirs is a difficult task more prone to criticism than appreciation. But that the United Nations has been able to make positive progress in many aspects of its work in the past decade despite repeated assaults on its principles is a credit to Mr. Waldheim's quiet but incisive leadership and the dedication of his staff.\n263.\tDuring this session this community of nations has had the very pleasant task of welcoming Vanuatu and Belize as the one hundred fifty-fifth and one hundred fifty-sixth Members, respectively, of the United Nations. Vanuatu is a sister State in the South Pacific. It and Belize, like many States Members of the Organization, including my own, are beautiful but small. Their membership in the United Nations is an investment in hope and peace. My delegation therefore most sincerely welcomes those two countries and looks forward to working closely with them in the years ahead.\n264.\tThis session of the General Assembly, more than any other convened in the past, is taking place at a very critical juncture in the history of the United Nations. I say critical because the world Organization is increasingly challenged and its efforts are frustrated by the lack of alternatives to deal with the realities of an evolving global geopolitical system, a system which is complex and demands a high degree of skill in statesmanship, ingenuity and foresight to maintain it perhaps more than was the case when the United Nations was first founded 36 years ago.\n265.\tThe increase in the membership, largely by the addition of former dependent territories, which in gaining sovereignty wish to control their own destiny, was bound to alter the basis of international relations.\n266.\tThe need of newly independent countries to develop social and economic policies mo.e consistent with their socioeconomic aspirations was bound to lead to a demand for the alteration of the basis of international economic relations. The rapid rate at which the process of decolonization has freed people from colonial tutelage was bound to be contagious for the remaining colonies.\n267.\tThose developments, as events have shown, have their effect on the adjustments some more radical and revolutionary than others that countries have had to make in their social, economic, political and legal systems. That those changes have taken place in a very brief period of time is to be applauded, as along with them has come a greater degree of freedom and awareness.\n268.\tI need not restate the fact that the emergent geopolitical picture in the largely free world of today calls for a revision of the basis of traditional international relations, a modification cognizant of the roles of Member States, no matter what their size, in the resolution of challenges which confront the United Nations, a modification which recognizes the desire of Member States, however disadvantaged by traditional and current international economic arrangements, to participate effectively on a basis of equity in any new global economic system and a modification which respects the right of sovereign States, no matter how weak and small they may be, to determine their own future.\n269.\tChallenges which face the United Nations are translated into problems because the Members' conceptions of those challenges have remained linked to or have moved very little away from traditional ways of resolving them.\n270.\tUnemployment, poverty and hunger are still predominantly looked upon as the consequences of the individual's failure to \\\"make it\\\", despite the inflationary nature of economies, over which the individual has little or no control, and the annual expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars on armaments while millions go hungry.\n271.\tRefugees continue to be pushed beyond national boundaries and on to rivers and seas, despite the United Nations commitments to human rights. Weak, small and politically divided countries are still invaded and militarily subjugated in the face of declarations by Member States that they will respect the principles of sovereignty, noninterference in internal affairs and the inadmissibility of the use\nof force.\n272.\tRealization of the political aspirations of dependent Territories to be free is still delayed, and those aspirations continue to be discussed in the context of the security of others.\n273.\tDespite the significance and the almost indispensable role of third-world countries in the economies of industrialized nations, the former are still not recognized in an economic relationship that is equitable and fair.\n274.\tIn spite of the antiquity of the concept of settling international disputes through wars and the very real likelihood of the annihilation of mankind if a world war were to occur, nations still continue to arm themselves to the teeth, and with weapons whose lethality is well known.\n275.\tIn an age in which the world can more than at any time in its history rightly boast of innumerable important achievements in both the quantitative and qualitative sense, it seems inconsistent and incongruent that world political leadership continues in its traditional path, apparently lacking the incisive skills, sophistication and enlightenment which would bring mankind the benefits of those achievements.\n276.\tI should like to illustrate that fact by commenting very briefly on the progress, or more appropriately the lack of progress, in the field of disarmament.\n277.\tThe major conclusions of the Disarmament Commission in its report to this session of the General Assembly contain very little that can engender hope for the future peace of the world. In its observations the Disarmament Commission has noted the deterioration in international relations as constituting a serious threat to world peace and stability. The Commission further observes:\n\\\"Among the greatest perils facing the world today is the threat of destruction as a result of nuclear war. The increase in weapons, especially nuclear weapons, far from helping to strengthen international security, on the contrary, weakens it.\n\\\"The Commission i? of the conviction that the arms race, in particular the nuclear arms race, runs counter to efforts to achieving further relaxation of international tensions.\\\" [See A/36/42, para. 19.]\n278.\tNoting also that the most recent agreements on strategic arms control between the two most heavily armed nuclear-weapon States remain un-ratified, the Commission deplored the fact that military expenditures are reaching even higher levels, and emphasized the necessity of releasing such resources to much-needed economic and social development.\n279.\tThe message that appears to be patently clear from the report of the Disarmament Commission is that the present doctrines of balance and equilibrium as the basis for disarmament, and the traditional approach of formal negotiation and ratification of treaties and conventions, are ineffective and unnecessarily laborious. Clearly there is a need to consider alternative approaches.\n280.\tThe disillusionment and discontent that the Disarmament Commission points to pervade all other areas of our disarmament efforts. My delegation, together with other nations of the Pacific, has stated continuously over the years, here in the United Nations and elsewhere, that the cessation of all nuclear weapons testing everywhere was and remains a matter of the highest priority as an effort towards total disarmament. That our efforts, especially in the South Pacific, have met with little success is perhaps only indicative of the rate of progress that has so far been achieved in our global efforts to halt the arms race. My Government is committed to the cessation of nuclear testing and of the dumping of nuclear wastes in the Pacific and other parts of the world, and will continue to work towards the realization of the Organization's ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament.\n281.\tIn a situation where nuclear nations are unable to declare themselves publicly as accepting a reasonable level of disarmament, or to agree to alternative approaches to their escalating arms race, it is a very tempting proposition indeed to suggest that an alternative might lie in nonnuclear nations deciding to withdraw their support from international disarmament forums, where they have provided the respectability of internationalism to unimplementable treaties, agreements and conventions. Concurrently, those non nuclear nations which are capable of doing so might wish to develop their own programs of nuclear armament.\n282.\tWhile these propositions might result in jolting nuclear nations out of their complacency, and might enable them to see the extremely dangerous consequences of their nuclear arms race, these are clearly irresponsible alternatives not to be pursued seriously. It is, however, becoming increasingly clear that any disarmament breakthroughs are not going to come from conventional thinking and approaches. More likely, as suggested by the Stanley Foundation in its analysis of the programs of the second special session on disarmament, they are going to result from approaches such as moratoriums, independent initiatives, non binding norms, confidence building measures and regional activities.\n283.\tWith regard to the international economic situation, events during the year and efforts at launching a new round of global negotiations relating to international economic cooperation for development have not led to progress, despite the tireless efforts of the President of the\nthirty-fifth session of the^General Assembly. We cannot help but express our grave concern at not having arrived at a final consensus directed towards the goal of eventually replacing an obsolete economic system, which is at variance with conditions prevailing today, by one that is based on equity and is more responsive to the needs of both the developing and industrialized countries.\n284.\tHowever, my delegation remains optimistic that through dialog, flexibility on all sides, political will and unity in action, consensus will emerge in the coming months. We air hopeful that the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development, to be held at Cancun, will give fresh impetus and facilitate the launching of global negotiation?. Sensible cooperation among all nations of the world, both rich and poor, is the only way to take up today's global economic challenge and establish a new international' economic order.\n285.\tThe recently concluded tenth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is another example of the NorthSouth dialog that represents more than eight years of negotiations, but even at this concluding stage cooperation and the political will are still sadly lacking. Through the years, the Conference, in its ability to find acceptable compromises between East and West, between the superPowers, and between the developed and developing nations, came to be regarded as a successful example of NorthSouth dialog.\n286.\tIn envisaging a new system for the exploitation of the enormous resources of the seabed outside national boundaries, the area which the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly proclaimed by consensus as the common heritage of mankind [resolution 2749 (XXV)], we thought the international community was at last at the threshold of a new era of cooperation in global negotiations. But efforts in recent months have been frustrated by a demand for a complete review of the draft convention, a move my delegation cannot but view with dismay. Perhaps, more than any other countries, it is the island nations such as Fiji, dependent to a considerable degree on the resources of the sea for their economic growth and development, that look to the early conclusion of all the negotiations on outstanding issues and the signing of the Final Act in Caracas in September next year. Like other Member States in the Group of 77, my country is resolved to conclude the long drawn out negotiations in 1982, and would appeal for a greater sense of accommodation than has been shown thus far, so that the Conference can complete the task of codifying the convention.\n287.\tThe political will and mutual cooperation that my delegation speaks of was resolutely exercised last year when consensus was reached on the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [General Assembly resolution 35/56]. It was a milestone and an excellent example of positive achievement in the field of international development cooperation.\n288.\tMy delegation, in welcoming the adoption of the International Development Strategy, wishes to stress that the significance of the strategy will depend on the commitment of Governments to act positively and with determination and by adequate policy measures to reach its goals and objectives. We attach great importance to the fulfillment of the provisions of the Strategy, for in cur view it would have a beneficial impact on the overall economic and social development of developing countries.\n289.\tAn area of grave discontent for many developing countries has for some time been international trade. Trade is seen by developing countries like Fiji as an engine for growth. It is vital to our economies, and especially so for those countries whose economies are based on a limited number of primary commodities. Our Pacific economies are small, and we are too dependent on a small number of commodities. We are still developing reliable, viable alternatives.\n290.\tThe openness of the Fiji economy necessitates close monitoring of the international situation. The present state of the world economy continues to constrain our own economy. Double-digit inflation, unemployment, the mounting burden of debt servicing, growing protectionism in international trade and the uncertainties brought about by the fluctuations in the international monetary system continue to plague our development efforts.\n291.\tFiji has also suffered severely from the effects of the world recession. We, along with many other third world countries, are heavily dependent on the export of two main primary commodities, in our case sugar and copra. Any price fluctuations in world commodity markets have serious effects on our economies. The earning from tourism has of late also been hit by recession in the tourist generating countries. Being very mindful that the heavy dependence on our two primary commodities makes our economy very vulnerable to external factors, we have made determined efforts during the past .decade at diversification into areas that are employment-generating and foreign exchange creating or saving, such as the agricultural sector, fisheries and the forest industry. But our immediate prospects for 1981 do not appear bright.\n292.\tInternational trade is vital to our economy. In this context, the best form of aid which countries could give us would be to provide us with access to assured markets for the exports of not only our primary products but also our manufactured goods, at fair and remunerative prices. For some island developing countries exports have traditionally exceeded imports by wide margins. We wish the present imbalance in trade to be narrowed through some sort of reciprocity. The internal market for our products is small, and our overseas markets are vast distances from us. Moreover, our trading difficulties are compounded by the problems that arise from our geographical location and our insularity. Increased accessibility of our products to overseas markets at remunerative prices is therefore important to our economic growth. The fight against protectionism is of particular significance to developing countries that are seeking markets for their exports.\n293.\tThe High Level Conference on Economic  Cooperation among Developing Countries, held at Caracas in May 1981, therefore represents an important achievement in the promotion of collective self-reliance and economic cooperation among developing countries.\n294.\tRegional trade and economic cooperation are of growing importance to us. The meetings of the Twelfth South Pacific Forum, held in Vanuatu in August 1981, have helped our South Pacific partners in solving many regional trade issues by working in cooperation with each other. We are encouraged to note that some genuine efforts have been made in the direction of regional trade among the South Pacific countries.\n295.\tThe recently concluded South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement is an important beginning for us in our trading relationships with New Zealand and Australia. The facility made available by this Agreement through the cooperation of those two countries is most welcomed and deeply appreciated.\n296.\tWe also note with sincere appreciation that under the Lome Convention the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group [ACP] have a wide range of goods which enjoy duty-free and unrestricted access into the markets of the European Community countries on a nonreciprocal basis. The Lome Convention also includes arrangements for assisting ACP countries in investment and trade promotion and also during natural disaster situations. Indeed, the Lome II Convention is a significant step forward towards closer links in the areas of trade and cooperation amongst island developing countries. An important aspect of the Lome Convention is the fact that there is constant dialog through negotiations between equal partners on the basis of mutual interest and advantage.\n297.\tAll nations, large and small, have had to cope with the financial stresses caused by the energy crisis of the 1970s and the mounting trade deficits as the cost of oil has skyrocketed. These events have highlighted the need for conservation measures and the search for alternative and renewable sources of energy. My Government is pleased to note the consensus reached at the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi in August 1981, on the program of Action 10 designed to achieve and accelerate an orderly energy transition from the present international economy based primarily on hydrocarbons to one based on new and renewable sources of energy. My delegation is hopeful that the ideals embodied in the Nairobi program of Action will be translated into reality through genuine global support and collaboration.\n298.\tIn the world political arena, the international community has been occupied with a series of issues for a number of years. In the Middle East, a satisfactory solution continues to elude us. Because of that problem's serious implications for peace and stability and its continuing effect on the global economic situation, it is imperative that all efforts be directed towards the attainment of a just and comprehensive solution.\n299.\tAs regards the fundamental principles that should guide the search for such a solution, the position of my delegation remains as follows. First, Israel must withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967 in accordance with the appropriate resolutions of the United Nations, including Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Secondly, there must be a satisfactory resolution of the Palestine question, which remains at the heart of the Middle East conflict. Thirdly, there must be recognition on a reciprocal basis by the parties directly concerned of each other's legitimate concerns, including the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and statehood and recognition of Israel's right to exist as a State and its security needs. Lastly, a political solution must be achieved through dialog and consultations between the parties concerned.\n300.\tHaving stated our position briefly, we must also stress the need for an end to those policies that place obstacles in the search for a comprehensive solution that is just and durable. In this context, we would like to associate ourselves with the concern expressed in Security Council resolution 487 (1981) over the recent Israeli air raids on an Iraqi nuclear reactor. My delegation also views the Israeli policy of creating settlements in occupied territories and its unilateral actions to alter the status of the international City of Jerusalem as constituting serious impediments to the peace process. Moreover, we believe that, given goodwill on all sides, Israel's security apprehensions could be reconciled with the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people . My delegation sincerely hopes that no efforts will be spared in the search for a peaceful solution to this longstanding problem which has caused suffering to many.\n301.\tThe situation in Lebanon remains a matter of concern because of its serious implications for peace and security. We are also aware that setbacks in the peace process in the Middle East tend to spill over into Lebanon, thus causing instability and tragic loss of life and property. Yet this need not be so, for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon should be fully respected.\n302.\tA peacekeeping force was dispatched to Lebanon in 1978 in the expectation that it would assist the return to normal in the area. Because of Fiji's abiding commitment to the principles of the Charter regarding peace and security, we chose to contribute to this important international peacekeeping effort. Yet we find that UNIFIL is often prevented from discharging its mandate fully because of provocative raids, which inevitably lead to instability and unjustifiable destruction of life and property. Following such an unfortunate sequence of events, a ceasefire in Lebanon was achieved recently. However, the volatility of the situation underlines the need for all to continue to exercise maximum restraint so as to permit the consolidation of the ceasefire arrangement.\n303.\tThe view is also widely shared that UNIFIL has proved to be a practical means of conflict control which, if given the necessary support, could contribute further to the wider political and diplomatic objectives of our Organization. And yet our ability to maintain our services with UNIFIL often has to be assessed in terms of the financial burden that it imposes, particularly on a small developing country such as mine. What is therefore urgent is that the regularity of reimbursements be maintained and that the accumulated arrears of reimbursable amounts, which in the case of my country run into millions of dollars, be sharply reduced. Moreover, the existing rates of reimbursements should be regularly reviewed so as to ensure that they remain fair and equitable. As peacekeeping is a collective responsibility, it is important, in our view, for all to pay the assessed contributions.\n304.\tThe situation in Afghanistan, which was first considered by the Assembly some two years ago, regrettably continues to engage our attention. Last year the Assembly adopted by a wide margin resolution 35/37, which, in brief, calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops and provides the key elements of a political solution. Moreover, it also addresses itself to the related matter of refugees. While the objectives of that resolution are yet to be realized, we are nevertheless aware of some efforts being made towards that end. In this regard, my delegation particularly welcomes the initiative of our SecretaryGeneral. We trust that circumstances will permit the continuation of such efforts as are designed to bring about a negotiated settlement of the Afghan question.\n305.\tIn Kampuchea, too, attempts to deal with the political and humanitarian dimensions of the question continue. As late as July of this year, an International Conference on Kampuchea was convened at the United Nations in pursuance of General Assembly resolution 35/6, with a view to encouraging a comprehensive political settlement of the problem. The Declaration of the Conference, which was adopted by consensus, specifies the components of a just and lasting settlement on which the negotiating process could be based. We sincerely hope that that important decision will provide the necessary impetus for an early settlement of the problem. My delegation remains convinced that a negotiated settlement achieved through the participation of the parties to the conflict would enhance peace and stability in the region. It would also help alleviate the sad plight of the refugees.\n306.\tAlso with regard to Asia, we continue to support any initiatives aimed at the peaceful reunification of the Koreas, and in this regard we take cognizance of the recent efforts made by South Korea.\n307.\tSimilarly, in Cyprus, we urge the continuation of the inter-communal talks, under the auspices of the Secretary General, and we hope that positive results will soon emanate from those discussions.\n308.\tPerhaps the single most important accomplishment of the United Nations is in the area of decolonization. Since its inception, the United Nations has facilitated the independence of millions, resulting in the trebling of the membership of the Organization. However, the international community remains short of its_desired goal of universality of membership, since colonialism still exists.\n309.\tBecause the process of decolonization is incomplete in our region, the matter was discussed at the recently convened meeting of the South Pacific Forum countries in the Republic of Vanuatu. At that meeting the Forum reaffirmed that the principle of self-determination and independence applied to all dependent territories in the Pacific Islands.\n310.\tMy delegation remains fully committed to that important decision, since it is compatible with the principles of decolonization that are contained in the Charter and in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960. In the pursuance of our commonly shared objectives we shall continue to be guided by the Pacific way, an approach that aims to find solutions to difficult questions through a process of dialog and consultations. It remains our earnest hope that this approach will be fully respected, thus enabling us to contribute towards ending the sad chapter of colonialism, wherever it may occur.\n311.\tWe view the remaining cases of colonialism in the same context. In the case of Namibia, for instance, our position remains as stated during the recently convened eighth emergency special session [5th meeting]. Briefly, therefore, my delegation reiterates its support for an internationally acceptable solution on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We are mindful of the continuing efforts being made in this regard, including those by the western contact group. However, in order to expedite the speedy and full implementation of resolution 435 (1978), it is imperative that South Africa abandon its ill-advised military policies within and beyond Namibia.\n312.\tViolations of human rights continue to be a destabilizing factor in the world today. Human rights situations have not only failed to improve, but continue to deteriorate in many parts of the world.\n313.\tThe injustices created by the many forms of human rights violations, in particular the repression of the legitimate aspirations of peoples, pose a major threat to international peace and security. People of the same racial origin, religious faith or political belief are made victims ,of persecution, and even entire nations are  deprived of their inalienable right to self-determination and are forced to live under the yoke of colonialism, alien domination or foreign occupation.\n314.\tThe question of apartheid in South Africa remains a matter of priority concern for the international community. Throughout its history the United Nations has rejected racism and racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations. To our deep regret, however, we find that several excesses, including repressions, continue under the repugnant system of apartheid. Moreover, those that attempt to oppose the inhuman system are systematically denied their most fundamental human rights. My delegation firmly supports the persistent calls for the abandonment of the apartheid system in favor of genuine majority rule. It is to be hoped that South Africa will soon see\\\" the wisdom of this course of action. Being a multiracial country, we firmly believe that all can participate in the national life of a country on the basis of full equality, freedom and human dignity.\n315.\tDespite the continuing progress being made in the United Nations system towards the formulation of appropriate international norms, and the efforts of the world body to ensure compliance with them, my delegation has noted with concern that United Nations debates on human rights issues have more often than not been motivated by international politics rather than by selfless humanitarian concerns. In our view, unless the United Nations succeeds in preventing human rights violations, there will be a continuous and persistent deterioration of the world situation.\n316.\tIn conclusion, I wish to return to the point made at the beginning of this statement, that is that, in our efforts to resolve major international issues that confront this community of nations, a much better spirit of cooperation and accommodation and a greater degree of sensitivity to the needs and rights of others are more urgently needed now than ever before. For it is only through determined and sustained efforts towards this end by all nations that we shall be nearer to what the United Nations in 1945 charted for our future: the creation of a new world order based upon the rule of law, peace and justice and respect for fundamental human rights.\n"

        "file_text": "72.\tLet me at the outset sincerely congratulate Mr. Kittani on his election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly. His election is a fitting tribute to him personally and an honor to his great country, with which my own country enjoys very cordial and friendly ties. His personal role, contribution and accomplishments in international affairs are a matter of public record. We are therefore confident that he will successfully guide the Assembly in all its deliberations. The delegation of the United Republic of Tanzania pledges to him its full cooperation.\n73.\tMay I also congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, who presided over the thirty-fifth session of the Assembly with such dedication and distinction. We have noted his persistent efforts during his presidency to seek solutions to the major and pressing problems of our time, particularly in the area of international economic cooperation. We wish him well in his new assignment and hope that he will continue to devote himself to these issues.\n74.\tI wish also to pay a tribute to the SecretaryGeneral for his commitment and tireless efforts in pursuit of the noble goals of the Organization. I am particularly happy to express our appreciation for his dedicated services, since I had the opportunity to work closely with him during the period that I was privileged to represent my country at the United Nations.\n75.\tMy delegation takes particular pride in welcoming into our midst the newly independent Republic of Vanuatu. The emergence of new countries from colonialism will always be a source of great joy to my country.\n76.\tIn the same spirit, therefore, we warmly welcome the accession of Belize to independence and its membership in the Organization.\n77.\tThe agenda before the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly is long and, in most cases, not new. Many items have remained on the agenda and have been debated over and over again. As solutions to these problems elude us, tensions continue to rise. In turn, these tensions make it even harder to search for lasting solutions; Problems that plagued the 1960s and the 1970s are still with us in the 1980s and have led to the creation of new and hitherto unknown problems which not only have added new dimensions to the old ones but have, in fact, compounded them. The world continues, to witness the worsening state of the international political and economic situation. The welfare of all nations and the wellbeing of all peoples are at stake. Amidst these disquieting developments, there is mounting disillusionment and even resignation among the peoples of the world.\n78.\tThere are today dangerous signs symptomatic of the cold war and reminiscent of the early postwar period. The danger of polarization of the world has again cast the world into a state of extreme uncertainty.. The spirit of detente, which served to lubricate the relations between East and West, seems to be fading fast. An era of confrontation, with its imponderable consequences,. appears to be superseding dialog and tolerance; there is a monumental escalation of the arms race; and regional conflicts and areas of tension are multiplying. Unless the 'present trend is arrested, the threat to the very survival of the present and succeeding generations is very real indeed.\n79.\tThat the world situation is so disquieting and the future so worrying is no longer subject to disagreement. Nor does anyone doubt that there is need for urgent action. Therefore it is a sad paradox that, notwithstanding the reality of the threat to its own existence, and having demonstrated great ingenuity in science and technology, mankind still appears to be helpless and, as it were, at a loss when it comes to solving problems which are essentially of its own making. In fact, there is no doubt whafJ soever among us all as to the capacity we have to change the course of many things, nor is it a case of ignorance of where the solutions are to be found.\n80.\tThe problems of the arms race and disarmament are much too familiar to all of us, and I therefore need not give a lengthy account of the issues involved. Perhaps the time has come when a mere restatement of the problems is not sufficient. There is a need to explore new ways and means to cope with the problems of peace and security in the world. We must ask ourselves whether saving the world from a nuclear holocaust is not a fair price to pay for our tolerance in diversity. The promotion of the principles of peaceful coexistence among all nations, ideological differences notwithstanding, can be an important development in the process of conflict resolution. Whether it be in the consideration of the comprehensive test ban treaty, the Indian Ocean or outer space, solutions will continue to elude us unless there is a firm commitment to peace through the restoration of confidence among States and a mutual respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of all States.\n81.\tThere can be no peace for people who continue to live in the darkness of humiliation or suffer the indignities of racism, colonialism and other forms of domination. History teaches us that people who have been denied their fundamental rights have invariably stood up defiantly in defense of such rights. Their resistance has taken different forms. To those millions who are oppressed, who suffer the ordeal of colonial domination or foreign occupation, or who face the nightmare of racial discrimination, the United Nations must be a source of hope and inspiration.\n82.\tWhile the decolonization process has perhaps been one of the most remarkable achievements of the United Nations, the final stages of this process seem to be the most difficult and painful. In Namibia, for example, we continue to witness colonial oppression and suffering which its people has gallantly resisted for decades. Oppression and suffering are rapidly being extended to peaceful independent States through aggression and provocation by a racist minority regime.\n83.\tThe numerous meetings at which the question of Namibia has been considered, culminating m the eighth emergency special session of the Assembly, are testimony to the importance which the international community attaches to this problem. This underlines the need for an urgent solution before peace and security in the region are put into further jeopardy.\n84.\tAs we had occasion to state during the Security Council debate on the issue in April, 4 as well as during the eighth emergency special session [9th meeting], we remain committed to the scrupulous implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In this process, we have insisted and shall continue to insist that first the five Western States, as the authors of the plan which the Council endorsed by that resolution have the obligation to see it implemented. In this context, we have noted with interest the joint communique issued by the Foreign Ministers of those five Western States following their meeting yesterday. Secondly, further prevarication serves only to strengthen the intransigence of South Africa. Thirdly, the central role of the United Nations in the implementation of the plan must be maintained. Fourthly, for as long as the path of a negotiated settlement continues to be blocked by Pretoria's recalcitrance, the people of Namibia and its liberation movement, SWAPO, should be effectively assisted in its liberation struggle.\n85.\tSouth Africa's continued intransigence and illegal occupation and use of the international Territory of Namibia as a springboard for repeated acts of aggression against the neighboring front-line States of the region ate a matter for serious concern. Its recent massive aggression against and occupation of part of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola was carried out in total disdain for the reaction of the international community, as well as for its consequences for international peace and security. Tanzania, in concert with other African States, will continue to render all the necessary assistance and support to the people of Angola.\n86.\tIn South Africa apartheid constitutes a constant crime against that country's people and seriously threatens international peace and security. The General Assembly would be talking in rather abstract terms of blatant violation of human rights if it were found lacking in its commitment to the elimination of this evil. We say so because nations have not been lacking in expressions of verbal outrage against apartheid. Yet apartheid is still with us, certainly not because of its invincibility, but because of the failure of the international community to back condemnations with effective action. On our part, we will spare no effort in supporting the struggle against apartheid. In doing so, we are bound by our conviction that the system of apartheid is an affront to the dignity of man. Tanzania is also convinced that the process of total isolation of the Government of South Africa until it abandons its apartheid policies is aimed at averting consequences harmful to peace and security.\n87.\tThe explosive situation in the Middle East remains a source of serious concern to the world community. Tanzania continues to stress that peace in the region will continue to elude us if the root cause of the conflict is not resolved. While the observance of the principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force and respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all the States in the area are conditions necessary for the attainment of a genuine, viable and lasting solution to the problem, the core of the Middle East problem remains the continued denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including the right to establish a homeland of their own.\n88.\tWe cannot make reference to the Middle East situation without voicing our concern at the anguish and suffering of Lebanon and its people. We support that country's legitimate aspirations for the safeguarding of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n89.\tIt is a matter of profound regret to my country that despite the efforts of the United Nations, the nonaligned movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the war between Iran and Iraq continues, imposing enormous suffering on the peoples of the two States in the process, besides endangering peace and security in the region. We shall continue to support all efforts aimed at bringing to an end that unfortunate conflict.\n90.\tWe note with hope the possibility of a solution to the question of Western Sahara. As the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, Mr. Daniel T. Arap Moi, President of the Republic of Kenya, reported yesterday [11th meeting], the session of the Assembly held recently at Nairobi adopted important decisions which, inter alia, provide for a fair and free referendum in the Territory which wiL enable the people of Western Sahara to determine their own future. We are gratified that through the Organization ofAfrican Unity [OAU] it has been possible to establish a framework within which this problem can be settled. As a member of the Implementation Committee, Tanzania will continue to work for the successful implementation of the recommendations adopted by the Committee at its session at Nairobi in August.\n91.\tThe problem of Cyprus remains unresolved. It is, however, a source of hope th,:.t the inter-communal talks have now gained momentum with the submission of comprehensive proposals encompassing both the territorial and constitutional aspects. Those efforts deserve the support and encouragement of all of us so that they can culminate in a final and lasting solution which ensures the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non alignment of Cyprus.\n92.\tDevelopments in the Korean peninsula, IndoChina and Afghanistan continue to preoccupy the Organization. While we strive to search for viable solutions, we must continue to promote dialog and eliminate courses of action which may further exacerbate tensions.\n93.\tWe witness also the deepening of the world economic crisis, which continues to have particularly severe consequences on the economies of the developing countries. That crisis has led to a further deterioration of the terms of trade of the developing countries, slow economic growth, imported inflation and a sharp deterioration in their balance of payments. That situation aggravates the already poor economic conditions of the third world.\n94.\tWhile the developing countries continue to bear the brunt of the world economic crisis because of the vulnerability of their weak economies to external conditions beyond their control, the impact: of that crisis is also increasingly being felt by the developed countries. The impact of the crisis on the economies of the developed countries is characterized by high rates of inflation, widespread unemployment, recession and fluctuations in exchange rates. Those conditions have led to widespread dissatisfaction and social tension in the developed countries. Unilateral efforts by some developed countries to seek national solutions to those global problems have not only failed to resolve such problems but have also had a severe cumulative impact on the economies of the developing countries.\n95.\tThe failure of those efforts to find lasting solutions to those global economic problems confirms our conviction that the present world economic crisis is structural and institutional rather than purely cyclical in character. The world economy is in a state of structural disequilibrium characterized by, among other things, stagflation, unemployment, underutilization of industrial capacity, chronic imbalances in international payments, monetary instability, trade distortions and an energy crisis. Those problems have engulfed the entire world, and now more than ever before the imperative to act together on a global scale has become evident.\n96.\tThe demand for the new international economic order is not simply a moral appeal. It is a call for the attention of the world society to the interdependence of countries in economic development. For the truth is that in a world of economic interdependence, it is unrealistic to think that a solution to the economic problems of one part of the world can be achieved in isolation from the rest of the world. Nor is it possible to deal with one issue in isolation from the rest, as there is always a direct link between all the various issues of development.\n97.\tThe proposed global negotiations offer the best framework for the comprehensive, coherent, integrated and therefore effective treatment of the entire world economic malaise. It is the hope of my delegation, therefore, that all efforts will be made during this session of the Assembly to reach an agreement which would enable launching of the global negotiations as early as possible. Tanzania also looks forward to the forthcoming International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held at Cancun, which we hope will provide the necessary positive political impetus and create an atmosphere which would be conducive* to progress in the currently stalled NorthSouth negotiations on international economic cooperation.\n98.\tThe United Nations provides the most viable forum for the promotion of freedom, peace, justice, international security and cooperation. We must therefore endeavor to make it well equipped to face the new challenges before us. The United Nations must truly become an effective instrument for the promotion of world peace and economic and social progress for all. If the Organization is to continue as an effective instrument for peace, the people of the world must place their confidence in it. Our commitment to its aims and principles must likewise never be in doubt.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly represents recognition of your unquestioned qualities as a veteran diplomat and just recognition of the constructive role played by the country that you represent in such a dignified manner, Iraq, on the international scene. On behalf of the People's Republic of Angola, we are extremely pleased to express our heartfelt congratulations and our sincere wishes for success in the discharge of your mandate.\n251.\tI should like to take this opportunity to extend to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar our sincere gratitude for his tireless work during the period in which he presided over the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and for the dignified and enlightened manner in which he discharged his high responsibilities.\n252.\tI should also like to pay tribute to the Secretary General for his considerable and significant efforts in the search for solutions to the thorny problems which the international community faces.\n253.\tIt is with profound concern that we address the Assembly inasmuch as the international situation has worsened considerably to the very point of threatening the actual survival of humanity. The present crisis in the process of achieving detente has created a new danger for international peace and stability.\n254.\tDespite the praiseworthy and persistent efforts of the socialist countries and of the democratic and peace loving and just ice-loving forces throughout the world to achieve detente, general and complete disarmament and the worldwide prohibition of the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, notably nuclear and bacteriological weapons, including the neutron bomb, not only have conflicts between States and plots against the sovereignty and security of States increased, but also the arms race has proceeded even further in the escalation of the irrational. Moreover, the cold war has once again reappeared by virtue of the disastrous policies pursued by the present Administration in the United States, which is bent upon direct or indirect confrontation between East and West.\n255.\tThus, forces hostile to the emancipation of peoples continue to attack the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries as well as the right of peoples under foreign domination to self-determination and independence. More and more they have resorted to the use of force, military intervention, occupation and interference, in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Thus, hotbeds of tension persist, above all in the Middle East, Africa particularly in its southern part\u2014SouthWest and SouthEast Asia, the Caribbean and Central America. New conflicts between States have been further exacerbating the international situation. .\n256.\tA year ago [7th meeting], we drew the attention of the Assembly to the progressive deterioration of the international situation. It is regrettable to note that its causes have persisted and their effects have been aggravated by the policies of certain .Western Powers: the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the policy of nonalignment have npt been strictly respected; aggression of all kinds against independent States has been fomented and encouraged; military bases have been imposed or strengthened in all parts of the world; the serious moves repeatedly made by the socialist countries and progressive and democratic forces aimed at achieving detente, general and complete disarmament and a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction have been blocked; the arms race has been deliberately and dangerously encouraged; the efforts of the developing countries aimed at a gradual reduction of the existing and ever-growing gap between the rich and poor countries have been impeded; resolutions clearly setting forth the imperative need to make the Indian Ocean a real zone of peace have not been respected; and the legitimate right to independence of the Namibian, South African, Sahraoui, Palestinian, East Timorean, Chilean, Salvadorian and Puerto Rican peoples, as well as many others, have been thwarted.\n257.\tIn this alarming situation which clearly threatens the future of peoples, especially that of the peoples of the developing countries, and the growing tragedy of human beings subjected to exploitation, oppression and injustice, we are compelled to repeat our earlier words:\n\\\"It is time for the millions of human beings still without freedom or the right to choose their own future to be able to avail themselves of ways and means of fighting servitude, humiliation, tyranny, poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease.\n\\\"It is time for all developing peoples to take resolute action in the fight against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, Zionism, expansionism, apartheid and the exploitation of man by man so as to be able freely to choose their own economic, political, social and cultural systems free from intimidation or pressure. It is time for them to take into their own hands their own natural resources and to exploit them for their own benefit and not for the benefit of multinational corporations. It is time for them flatly to reject all forms of subordination and dependence on any Power and all interference and all pressure, be it political, economic or military. It is time for them to demand, in combined and concerted fashion, the dismantling of foreign military bases on the territories\\\" of their countries which have been established against their will. It is time for them to make an effective contribution to the safeguarding of international peace and security and the easing of international tension. It is time for them to make a further effort to find effective means of mobilizing their human, financial, organizational and technological resources, thus laying a solid foundation for mutual economic cooperation [in a wide variety of fields]\\\".\nTo achieve that, perhaps all that is necessary\n\\\"is for all the nonaligned countries without exception decisively to put into effect the final Declaration and the Program of Action for economic cooperation approved at the historic Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held at Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979, for the serious problems besetting the world today to be properly resolved. That is our hope and our conviction\\\".18\n258.\tDirectly faced with the provocations, acts of aggression and challenges of the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime, the People's Republic of Angola expects from the international community further commitment and decisions commensurate with the requirements of the moment, so that the Angolan people can, for its part, make greater efforts to expel the racist invaders, to retaliate against future acts of aggression and to ensure the defense of its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the crucial situation facing southern Africa, any passiveness, any abdication of duty on the part of the international community would be a reward for illegality, a substantial encouragement for criminal acts of aggression and even a contribution to the consolidation of the minority racist and terrorist Pretoria regime.\n259.\tNo one here is unaware of the magnitude or the intent of the recent armed invasion perpetrated by the Pretoria regime against the People's Republic of Angola, or the enormous sacrifices already made by the people of Angola and the extremely high price it is paying, virtually alone, in thousands of human lives and in material damage, in the accomplishment of its internationalist duty and in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of international bodies concerning the independence of Namibia.\n260.\tAt that time, the head of State and Government of Angola took care to bring to the attention of the competent international bodies and forums the facts of the brutal aggression and its disastrous consequences. He requested the. convening of an emergency meeting of the Security Council so that the Council could take effective measures commensurate with the situation, once it had recognized a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola and a grave threat to international peace and security.\n261.\tDespite the condemnations of the South African invasion made in firm and unequivocal terms by nearly the whole of the international community, the Government of the United States of America unscrupulously resorted to the use of the veto to oppose the adoption of a Security Council resolution that would have condemned the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime. That was clear proof of its close alliance with the shameful system of apartheid, and undeniable testimony to its denial of human rights and its insolent scorn for the African community in particular.\n262.\tEver since the establishment of the United Nations Council for Namibia in May of 1967 as the legal Administering Authority of Namibia until independence and the decision-making body of the United Nations for that Territory, the Pretoria regime and its allies have endeavored to thwart the discharge of the mandate of that Council and have orchestrated a series of maneuvers aimed at impeding or delaying as long as possible the inevitable independence of the Namibian people and, notably, the coming to power of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the sole legitimate representative of the people of Namibia.\n263.\tIn Security Council resolutions 428 (1978), 447 (1979), 454 (1979) and 475 (1980) on the numerous premeditated, persistent and prolonged armed invasions perpetrated by South Africa, in flagrant violation of the airspace, national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola, the Security Council, among other things, in condemning South Africa's aggression against the People's Republic of Angola,\n\\\"... demands that South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola\\\" [resolution 428 (1978), para. 4]',\n\\\"Demands that South Africa cease immediately its provocative armed invasions against the People's Republic of Angola ...\\\" [resolution 447 (1979), para. 3];\n\\\"Requests Member States urgently to extend all necessary assistance to the People's Republic of Angola and other frontline States ...\\\" [ibid., para. 5];\n\\\"Calls for the payment by South Africa of full and adequate compensation to the People's Republic of Angola for the damage to life and property resulting from these acts of aggression\\\" [resolution 475 (1980), para. 6];\n\\\"Decides to meet again in the event of further acts of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola by the South African racist regime, in order to consider the adoption of more effective measures in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, including Chapter VII thereof' [ibid., para. 7],\n264.\tAs can be seen, the Security Council decided on numerous occasions to envisage the adoption of more effective measures against the Pretoria regime. And we have been awaiting those measures patiently to this day.\n265.\tThus, faced with the intransigence of the Pretoria regime in regard to putting an end to its illegal occupation of Namibia, faced with its refusal to observe the relevant resolutions of competent international bodies, faced with the continued criminal aggression perpetrated against the People's Republic of Angola and other front-line States, which undeniably represents a serious threat to international peace and security, a particularly serious question arises: how many new acts of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola, how many invasions or acts of premeditated armed aggression, how much loss of human life and how much more material damage must we suffer before the competent international bodies adopt the really effective measures that are available to them?\n266.\tEverybody knows that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations plan elaborated and negotiated by the Western Powers within the contact group are being challenged by the present North American Administration, concerned as it is with providing protection to the apartheid regime and the latter's illegal interests in Namibia.\n267.\tThe contact group having expressed in Rome its \\\"belief that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provided a solid basis for the achievement of a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question, Africa is waiting for the foreign ministers of the member nations of that group to establish, at their forthcoming meeting to be held on 24 September here in New York, the modalities and the timetable for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), without amendment of any kind, so that Namibia may become independent during 1982.\n268.\tIn South Africa itself, the situation continues to deteriorate progressively, to the extent that the internal contradictions of the apartheid regime have been aggravated and the heroic fighters of the African National Congress [ANC] tirelessly pursue their political and military activities, the effects of which have been recognized by the Pretoria regime and by the South African press. Our tributes and confirmation of our steadfast solidarity go to the ANC militants.\n269.\tIn Western Sahara, the heroic Sahraoui people, led by the POLISARIO Front 20 its sole legitimate representative, is victoriously continuing its armed struggle against Moroccan occupation to recover its independence and its national sovereignty. It is with new, justified hope that we are awaiting the necessary political solution in the wake of the recent deliberations of the Implementation Committee on Western Sahara of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], which met from 24 to 26 August at Nairobi. We hope that the decision of that Committee to organize and conduct a general and free referendum on self-determination may become a reality as soon as possible, once a ceasefire has been established between the parties to the conflict, namely, the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco, and once the withdrawal of the Moroccan forces has been assured.\n270.\tAs regards the development of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, we reaffirm that the specific proposals contained in the declarations of its Government since 15 May 1980 constitute a valid basis for the search for a negotiated political solution. What is essential is that the neighboring countries, that is, Pakistan and Iran, heed these words, in line with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, because that would result in the normalization of relations among three neighboring nonaligned countries and would favor the restoration of a climate of harmony and stability in the region.\n271.\tFor its part, the valiant people of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has won appreciable success since last year in consolidation of its revolutionary process and in gaining control of its territory, as well as in the economic and social fields. It is, however, regrettable and inconceivable that the legitimate representatives of the people of Kampuchea still do not occupy their rightful place in all international bodies.\n272.\tDespite the persistent efforts of the heroic people of Korea to reunify its country peacefully and without any foreign interference in its internal affairs, we note with indignation the continued imperialist* maneuvers aimed at establishing two Koreas. It is imperative that there be an unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in the southern part of Korea, that the armistice agreement be replaced by a lasting peace agreement and that existing military bases there be dismantled, in order that the people of Korea in its entirety may make a reality of the three principles that are essential to its future: independence, peaceful reunification and national unity.\n273.\tAs regards the situation that prevails in East Timor, it is deplorable and unacceptable that foreign armed forces belonging to a member nation of the nonaligned movement should have occupied a part of the Territory namely, the capital of the Democratic Republic of East Timor ever since the proclamation of its independence in 1975, following the withdrawal of the former administering Power without its having defined or established the legal and political status of the Territory.\n274.\tLast year the Portuguese Government decided to re-assume its obligations and responsibilities with regard to East Timor, and it formally reaffirmed the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination. We permit ourselves to hope that the Portuguese Government will effectively, with firmness and courage, make every effort to end the Indonesian military occupation and ensure the transfer of power to the people of the Democratic Republic of East Timor, in so far as it bears responsibility for finding a solution to this problem.\n275.\tIn this context, we appeal to the international community to note the verdict of the Permanent People's Tribunal on East Timor, which met in Lisbon from 19 to 21 June 1981. The verdict has been circulated as document A/36/448. That verdict clearly shows that the Indonesian Government has been guilty of the crime of war and genocide in East Timor and that the Government of the United States is guilty of complicity in the aggression.\n276.\tIt is incumbent upon the international community to render all possible assistance to the people of East Timor.\n277.\tIn the Middle East the problem remains the same, although its consequences are becoming even graver for the Arab peoples. As long as the legitimate right of the Arab people of Palestine to recover their homeland, usurped by Israel, and to establish an independent State is not fully recognized by all, as long as Israel does not withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories, as long as it does not stop its criminal raids and aggression against Lebanon, as long as it continues its policy of establishing settlements in Palestinian or occupied Arab territory, as long as the United States of America does not stop supporting Israel in all possible ways in its plans for annexation, as long as Jerusalem is not fully restored to the Arab nation and as long as the so-called Camp David agreements and the EgyptianIsraeli peace treaty represent a partial and separate commitment which does not take into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, thus constituting a gross violation of resolutions adopted by numerous international bodies, a just and lasting peace will never be achieved. However, we are convinced that the solution of the Palestinian problem and of the Middle East situation is in the hands of the Arab countries if they decide, together, to use all the means available to them against all those that support Israel.\n278.\tWe reaffirm our steadfast support for the Palestinian people and their sole legitimate representative, the PLQ.\n279.\tWe also take this occasion to reaffirm our tireless support for the people and Government of the Republic of Cyprus in their just struggle to protect their independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non alignment.\n280.\tIn Latin America appreciable and positive changes have taken place thanks to the courageous struggle waged by the peoples there. We commend the victories won by the people of El Salvador and their front-line organizations, the Frente Democratico Revolucionario and the Fuerzas Populares de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional Farabundo Marti', in their legitimate struggle against the present regime, as well as the successes achieved by the Puerto Rican and Chilean peoples in their struggle against imperialism and its agents to bring about a transfer of power to them and so that they may freely decide their own future.\n281.\tIt is with particular satisfaction that we welcome the Republic of Vanuatu on its becoming a Member of the United Nations. We also welcome the proclamation of independence of Belize, which we hope soon to see a Member of the United Nations.\n282.\tThe people of Angola will soon commemorate the sixth anniversary of the proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola. Under the enlightened leadership of Comrade Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, President of the MPLA\u2014the Labor Party\u2014President of the Republic and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, the Angolan people are fully mobilized to expel the armed forces of Pretoria from the southern part of the national territory and thereby to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic and to devote the necessary means to its economic and social development.\n283.\tWe wish to express our deep gratitude to all those who, in one way or another, have shown their solidarity with us following the criminal invasion carried out by the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime. We hope that the People's Republic of Angola will be able to benefit from the urgent provision of material and financial assistance so that it may overcome the present grave situation and ensure our national reconstruction. The struggle goes on. Victory is certain.\n"

        "file_text": "134. Mr. President, first of all, I should like to convey to you the warmest congratulations, on behalf of the Italian Government and on my own behalf, on your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is for us a source of deep satisfaction that this honor has been conferred upon the representative of a country with which Italy maintains relations of close friendship and fruitful cooperation. Your long experience in the activities of the United Nations and the eminent qualities you have displayed in the service of your country are guarantees of the balanced and efficient guidance of the work of the Assembly.\n135.\tI should like to take this opportunity to express to your predecessor, Mr. von Wechmar, our deep appreciation of the important contribution he made throughout the past year to the affirmation of the ideals of the United Nations and to the search for a solution to some of the most urgent problems which the Organization has to tackle. It is a particular pleasure for me now to wish him every success in his forthcoming post as Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to my own country, Italy.\n136.\tI also wish to reaffirm my Government's deep respect and full support for the praiseworthy actions undertaken by the SecretaryGeneral in the interests of peace and of the settlement through negotiation of some of the most complex problems of our time, in a particularly delicate phase of the international situation.\n137.\tFinally, I wish to convey a warm welcome to the delegation of the Republic of Vanuatu, whose country, in keeping with the universal vocation of the United Nations, has just been admitted as the one hundred and fifty-fifth Member of the United Nations.\n138.\tIt is not without emotion that I address the General Assembly, which represents the community of peoples of the earth, while thinking of the complexity and dramatic nature of the problems which make the state of international relations uncertain and precarious.\n139.\tBesieged as we are these days by problems that are all apparently urgent and critical, we run the risk, in the tumult of our everyday lives, of failing to grasp the full significance of events. I believe that this Hall, in which nearly all the nations of the world are represented, is the most appropriate place for trying to work out a synthesis designed not only to provide a better understanding of the course of contemporary history but, above all, to make more effective and incisive the contribution that all of us, as Governments, are called upon to make in order to create the conditions for a better future for mankind.\n140.\tThat is why I feel it necessary to take an overall view of the individual problems which face us, reducing them basically to two common denominators, namely, the East-West relationship and the NorthSouth relationship. These relationships, while maintaining their own individuality and special characteristics, are not really separate but affect and influence each other.\n141.\tWe must bear in mind this close interrelationship. It would be unrealistic to ignore the fact that the slowing down in the East-West negotiation process has brought about a situation of general insecurity and has exercised a negative influence on the orderly development of international relations. At the same time, we are convinced that a fairer distribution of world resources, through a transfer of wealth from the more prosperous to the less favoured countries, would help to reduce the tensions which exist in so many parts of the world, to promote stability in the more afflicted areas and, indirectly, also to improve the state of East-West relations.\n142.\tClosely connected with the East-West relationship and the NorthSouth relationship are the specific roles which Italy, taking into account its international position, its vocation and traditions and its geographical Ideation, can and intends to play in order to make a positive contribution of its own to the cause of security and peace k; the world.\n143.\tThat contribution is reflected in Italy's membership in the Atlantic Alliance. That Alliance, because of its defensive character, has proved to be an essential prerequisite to security, peace and detente in Europe and therefore to world equilibrium. In this context must be viewed the resolute participation of Italy in the construction of the European Community, which, as it develops, is increasingly aimed at ensuring security and peace. Italy is convinced that the building and strengthening of the European Community is necessary. In its growth it will consolidate and ensure the strengthening of cooperation on our continent, a more fruitful opening, on a basis of equality, towards the States of other geographical areas, and a reaffirmation of the fundamental importance of human rights. Therefore we are convinced that the process of European integration must now acquire a new momentum, overcome the obstacles arising from the current prevalence of economic interests and seek, in a political union, the path to a more effective contribution to the evolution of the contemporary world towards a better equilibrium and hence towards peace. The voice of Europe must not be underestimated in a process of stabilization and peace that will be truly consistent and constant.\n144.\tItaly, precisely because it is an expression of the civilization of the Mediterranean, has always been especially aware of the problems and crises of that area, which, in its turn, remains central to world balance. In that region old tensions seem to become more entrenched while new tensions are making the old ones more threatening, thus imposing on all the countries concerned a common responsibility to eliminate the sources of danger.\n145.\tAs regards relations between East and West, with all their historical and political complexities, Italy is following a policy which reflects responsibility and firmness but also an effective desire for dialogue. This has been our attitude in the consultations held with the Western nations with which we are linked in a defensive alliance, as well as in our contacts with the Soviet Union and the other countries of Eastern Europe.\n146.\tThe cardinal points of the Italian position are well-known. They are based on the search for a balance of forces, linked with a gradual reduction of those forces to the lowest possible levels, and on the commitment to negotiations without preconditions, but founded upon mutual recognition of the essential requirements of security and peace. We also believe that a policy of detente cannot be conducted within watertight compartments, but requires a renunciation of adventurous policies and the adoption of coherent and responsible ones, simultaneously and in all geographical regions. The degree of interdependence of our world is so great that we cannot hope to be able to guarantee oases of' peace and stability while elsewhere tensions increase and the basic rights of nations and States are violated.\n147.\tConcerning tactical nuclear forces, a particularly serious imbalance has occurred in the very heart of Europe, an area where the concentration of military forces is extremely high. This imbalance must therefore be corrected through the adoption of the necessary decisions and the active use of negotiation. Accordingly, Italy has worked with its allies and with the potential negotiators to bring closer the prospect Of negotiations and is now awaiting the initiation of talks; to which we will be ready, as in the past, to make a constructive contribution.\n148.\tTo be realistic a disarmament policy must be aimed at a global balance, not just a regional one. For this reason, Italy has consistently stressed the validity of the SALT process, which, in our view, remains a basic point of reference in the Held of disarmament.\n149.\tAt this point I should like to stress that every result achieved in the field of disarmament can have positive repercussions on development aid.\n150.\tFor its part, Italy has helped, in a spirit of responsibility and moderation, to keep open the prospects for an interEuropean dialogue, and it intends to accord the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe the importance that it deserves. Throughout the course of the. Madrid negotiations we have refused to abandon the hope of achieving substantial and balanced results, including the convening of a conference on disarmament in Europe. Moreover, we have agreed that next autumn a further attempt should be made in that direction. It is in the interests of all that that attempt should yield the hoped for results.\n151.\tA great European country, Poland, has experienced in recent months and is experiencing at present difficulties deriving from its internal evolution. We fervently hope that this country may carry out its chosen action with full respect for the inherent values of its culture and its sovereignty.\n152.\tHere I should like to point out that the major failures of the United Nations, when they have occurred, are to be attributed to the lack, at the world level, of the political will for peace and progress based on a careful, balanced and realistic assessment of regional conflicts within a global perspective.\n153.\tI said earlier that the precarious nature of the East West relationship, because of the indivisible nature of security and hence of peace, has had inevitable repercussions on existing world tensions and that, conversely, the elimination of those tensions becomes an important means of reducing the difficulties which stand in the way of the stabilization of East-West relations.\n154.\tFor their part, the 10 members of the European Community have tried and are still trying to contribute to this stabilizing action by proposing formulas aimed at removing the various causes of tension and restoring peace to suffering peoples, thus contributing to stabilization.\n155.\tIn the Assembly, at the eighth meeting, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, Lord Carrington, described the European Community's position on the major sources of conflict and tension. I take this opportunity to give Italy's full support to the views that he voiced.\n156.\tfor its part, the Italian Government notes with deep concern that more than 18 months have elapsed since Afghanistan was invaded by Soviet forces, in flagrant violation of international norms and the Charter of the United Nations. In the meantime, no attention has been paid to the requests and appeals made by the overwhelming majority of the members of this Assembly, the members of the non aligned movement, to which we give great importance, the countries of the Organization or the Islamic Conference and those of the European Community that those troops, whose presence constitutes the only real interference in the area, should be withdrawn and that the Afghan people should be given back the right to determine freely their own future and recover the traditional position of their country as an independent and nonaligned State. I am confident that the Assembly will at this session reaffirm the position previously adopted on this question.\n157.\tThere is another case of military occupation the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia that violates the basic principles of coexistence among peoples. The appeals made by the United Nations and by the nonaligned movement for a solution based on those principles have so far remained unheeded. The Italian Government feels that the International Conference on Kampuchea, held in New York last July, should be given credit for having worked out a balanced and constructive basis for negotiation. My government hopes that Viet Nam will recognize the serious and reasonable nature of the proposals put forward by the Conference and decide to take part in its future deliberations, thus fulfilling its obligations to the United Nations and contributing to the cause of stability in SouthEast Asia.\n158.\tI turn now to the African continent and I should like, first of all, to express the full solidarity of the Italian Government with the Angolan Government, victim of recent bloody aggression by South African forces. Violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of the Organization, from whatever source, must give rise to the strongest condemnation by the international community.\n159.\tOnce more, the aggression against Angola was launched from Namibian territory, which is still subject to an illegal regime of occupation. This cannot but further emphasize the urgent need to solve a problem which has been dragging on for years, that of the independence of Namibia. Italy maintains that it must be solved without recourse to force, but rather by political means and through negotiations, on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Hence, the Italian Government addresses the most urgent appeal to all the parties directly concerned, including the countries belonging to the Western contact group, to make every constructive effort to ensure that Namibia rapidly achieves its independence and can occupy at our next session, as a sovereign State, the place to which it is entitled hi our Assembly id in international community.\n160.\tThe accession of Namibia to independence would favour the development of the entire region, increase the stability of all the countries concerned and primarily Angola and eliminate every justification for the presence of nonAfrican troops in the region.\n161.\tStill dealing with the problems of southern Africa, we must note with regret the absence of any significant progress towards the abolition of apartheid in South Africa, an iniquitous system which constitutes an intolerable insult to human dignity and which my Government firmly condemns, as reflected in our scrupulous observance of the military embargo decreed by the Security Council.\n162.\tWith regard to the other African crises, Italy considers that the 0AU is the forum best qualified to promote the stability of the continent and to settle its disputes without dangerous external interference.\n163.\tWe are strengthened in this conviction by the recent favourable development in the dispute over the Western Sahara where, under the auspices of the OAU, the basis for an acceptable solution has been laid down. We hope that similar progress will soon be achieved in Chad with the deployment of the interAfrican force which is to replace, under the auspices of the OAU, the foreign military contingent now present in that country in a different capacity.\n164.\tTurning finally to the problems of the Horn of Africa, while we note with satisfaction the signs of improvement in the relations between Kenya and Somalia, we are bound to express our deep concern at the continuing tension between Somalia and Ethiopia, two countries with which Italy is linked by ancient historical and cultural ties. Within the limits of its possibilities and with respect for the independence of both countries, Italy awaits with interest and is ready to contribute to every effort which may help to produce a just solution of this crisis and which will allow the peoples of the Horn of Africa to end the present dangerous spiral of confrontation and concentrate their energies on the fight against their common enemy, namely, underdevelopment.\n165.\tI would like to express in this Hall my gratification at the recent return of some countries of the Latin American continent to democratic normality and at the trends in that direction which may be noted in certain countries. Italy hopes that such trends will be further intensified and will yield concrete results, because it is convinced that a substantial affirmation of the principle of the respect of the popular will and of the ideals of pluralism and democracy can only strengthen the cause of peace on the continent, particularly in Central America, and prevent the resurgence of fratricidal struggles such as those which, linked to the pressure of external destabilizing factors, are tearing apart the people of El Salvador.\n166.\tAt the beginning of my statement I observed that the Government of Italy devotes particular attention to the problems of the Mediterranean.\n167.\tIf the objective to be pursued is that of the security of the area, its attainment requires the solution of the various crises that afflict the region, and, above all, the establishment of peace in the Middle East. This area has too 'neat a need for peace and justice for us to sit back and conclude, with facile pessimism, that we have exhausted the possibilities for seeking a political solution. On the contrary, we feel that important and positive factors are emerging which, together with the effort the European Community is making, gives us reason to believe that today in the Middle East the starting point is no longer zero. Italy will continue to support any progress towards a political settlement of these disputes and remains committed to the contribution which the Ten feel able usefully to offer. May I add, in this respect, that we have noted with interest the proposals put forward by Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia because they reveal the readiness of that country for a negotiated solution of the Middle East problem and because there is an interesting principle implicit in them.\n168.\tOur action is based on certain essential principles which may be summed up as follows: the right to existence and the right to security of Israel, a great people to whom mankind owes a considerable cultural debt, are for us facts which we cannot renounce; we recognize as well the right of the Palestinian people to self determination and, if it so decides, 10 the creation of a State entity. This leads us to the conclusion that whatever the operational modalities of the implementation of a peace process, such a process must pass through a compulsory and fundamental stage, namely, mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestinians. In this respect, we feel that the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], which we recognize as a significant political force of the Palestinian people, should be given an opportunity to prove its readiness to contribute to a peaceful solution of the ArabIsraeli dispute.\n169.\tCrises such as that in the Middle East require realism, but also courage and hope. We must encourage moves towards detente by both parties so as to prepare the ground for direct dialogue since, in this case also, any lasting solution finally depends on the will of all directly concerned parties.\n170.\tThe best proof of the validity of this approach has been provided by the truce and cessation of hostilities in southern Lebanon, achieved through diplomatic efforts that Italy fully supported. That development has opened the way to the beginning of a pacification process in that long suffering country. It is now more than ever necessary to guarantee, with the help of all countries, the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon, thus avert ing a recurrence of the sufferings endured in the past by that defenseless people. Italy is cooperating in the pursuit of that objective by its participation in the peace mission of the United Nations in southern Lebanon, which we hope will be allowed to play an increasing role in that country.\n171.\tA speedy cessation of the hostilities between Iran and Iraq would put an end to the material and human losses involved and thus remove a serious obstacle to the peaceful progress of those peoples.\n172.\tIn addition to the crisis in the Middle East, recently in the Mediterranean region there have been signs of a disquieting restlessness which seems to make even less attainable the dialogue and cooperation that we would like to see built up in the area. During this delicate phase we must appeal to all concerned to show a sense of responsibility, to maintain attitudes compatible with the goals of peace full coexistence and to renounce claims that conflict with international norms.\n173.\tIt was in the context of a policy aimed at further increasing the stability of the central Mediterranean region that the Italian initiative was taken with regard to the declaration of neutrality issued by Malta, which can only prove to be a useful instrument in favor of peace and progress. In order to help strengthen this new status, when registering its agreements with Malta in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, Italy requested the SecretaryGeneral [see A/36/348, annex] to draw the attention of Member States to that part of the Italian declaration in which all the States concerned were invited and I repeat that invitation now to take note of Malta's declared neutrality.\n174.\tAnother Mediterranean island, Cyprus, has unfortunately been experiencing a difficult situation for many years. However, the negotiations between the two communities, which the United Nations can use its authority effectively to encourage, now have a greater chance of leading to a solution to the problem. Again, for its part, Italy has done and will do everything possible to assist those negotiations.\n175.\tIt is an essential function of the United Nations to monitor the imbalances in the armaments sector, both conventional and nuclear, and the increasing spread of weapons of all types among the less developed countries.\n176.\tThe Italian Government attaches particular importance of the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament to be held in 1982, which will offer a unique opportunity to review the results so far achieved and to outline the programs to be followed in the future.\n177.\tUnfortunately, it must be said that the Committee on Disarmament, at Geneva, has not yet been able fully to carry out the tasks entrusted to it by this Assembly. At the same time an increasing need is felt within the Committee to avoid abstract generalizations so that negotiating activities can concentrate primarily on subjects that offer realistic possibilities of agreement. Accordingly, Italy continues to demand a ban on chemical weapons and the destruction of stockpiles thereof in order to avert the serious threat posed by the proliferation of these weapons, which are indeed weapons of mass destruction.\n178.\tIn the nuclear field, Italy, which is a party to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, views with sympathy the demands of certain nonaligned countries for security guarantees on the non-use of nuclear weapons by the nuclear-weapon States. Italy is making a direct contribution to their efforts in its capacity as chairman of the pertinent Ad Hoc Working Group at Geneva.\n179.\tIn the field of conventional weapons, while understanding the security requirements of many countries regarding the protection of their independence and territorial integrity, we feel that the Assembly must none the less redouble its efforts to regulate such weapons.\n180.\tStill on the subject of disarmament, Italy has for some years put forward proposals aimed at limiting the potentially destabilizing aspects of an arms race in space and has consistently affirmed the need to continue to work on a global program of disarmament as an appropriate basis on which to ensure the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.\n181.\tAs regards the important work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, Italy is firmly convinced that the exploitation of the mineral resources of the seabed must benefit all mankind.\n182.\tDuring the past year, in despite of the difficulties arising from the present crisis, international economic cooperation has made modest but significant advances. An authoritative and inspired voice, that of Pope John Paul II, has recently been raised in the context of that comprehensive review, the encyclical Laborem Exercens, to encourage that cooperation. It recommends a profoundly innovative vision of labor problems as well as a new relationship between institutions and labor. I believe that all men of good will should carefully study those lofty pronouncements.\n183.\tThe United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy has given positive indications as to the road we should follow in order over the long term to solve the energy problems of the non-oil-producing developing countries. As for the short and medium terms, these problems could be tackled effectively if we could finally reach a consensus on the establishment of an energy affiliate of the World Bank, a proposal that Italy has supported on numerous occasions.\n184.\tThe recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries was also successful in adopting the Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries. That program will now constitute the basic reference point for the initiatives of the international community. I should like to stress that these are countries to which Italy is already devoting a substantial percentage of its official development aid and for which it plans in the future to develop a more effective and differentiated policy of cooperation which will allow us to achieve the target amounts set in that program.\n185.\tItaly is also playing an active role in the field of science and technology for development. As I had occasion to stress to a delegation of ministers from developing countries with whom I recently met in Rome, we hope that the United Nations Interim Fund for Science and Technology for Development, to which Italy has made a substantial contribution, will have sufficient resources to achieve its objectives.\n186.\tIn the trade sector, we are convinced of the need, reaffirmed by the seven main industrialized countries at their meeting in Ottawa, for a vigorous joint effort to fight against the resurgence of the spectrum of protection ism and to keep open the system of world trade. Next year, the GATT Ministerial Conference, welcomed by the Ottawa summit, will provide us with a valuable opportunity to consider in depth the obstacles which already impede the orderly development of international trade, as well as those which threaten to arise. But the most serious challenge concerns the launching of global negotiations, since it affects the very negotiating ability of the international community.\n187.\tThe Italian Government maintains that the problems of the NorthSouth dialogue can only be tackled within the framework of the global negotiations which this Assembly will be called upon finally to launch after appropriate and careful preparation. Moreover, our awareness of the urgency of these questions has led us to take an initiative designed to help in the solution of the tragic problem of word hunger.\n188.\tAfter having substantially increased in recent years its contribution to the major organizations and programs of the United Nations operating in the agricultural and food sector, Italy, true to its civil and Christian traditions which other cultures reflect as well, has just suggested the organization of an operational meeting for the purpose of achieving, through the action of the United Nations specialized agencies located in Rome, certain concrete objectives to be given immediate effect relating to the struggle against hunger and malnutrition and cooperation in the field of agriculture and food production. This initiative, which was put forward by Italy at Ottawa and approved in the final communique of that meeting 10 has been endorsed by the countries of the European Community and is now in the course of preparation and development. We trust that that initiative, besides offering prompt solutions to the international scourge of malnutrition, will help to strengthen confidence in the possibility of advancing along the path of economic growth through cooperation, which is one of the basic aims of the United Nations.\n189.\tIn concluding my statement, I should like to refer to the important dual responsibility of the United Nations in the field of human rights: the definition of principles and related standards of conduct, and vigilance as to their effective implementation.\n190.\tAs regards the first objective, the Organization has already achieved substantial and indisputable results. But in the matter of vigilance and respect for the norms and principles adopted by the Organization, the United Nations has not shown appreciable progress. Policies which disregard the essence of human rights have continued to be practiced, and we are still faced with extensive violations of human rights as a result of local conflicts or situations of instability or intolerance. Italy is ready to cooperate fully in this respect with the world Organization, convinced as we are that wherever the value and dignity of the human person is at stake no obstacle must be allowed to stand in our way. Only thus can we give effectiveness and incisiveness to United Nations action in the field of the international protection of human rights. This is perhaps one of the most difficult challenges that the United Nations will face in the years to come,\n191.\tAs we tackle the specific objectives facing this Assembly in the political and economic fields and discuss the best means of achieving those goals, we must not lose sight of the basic consideration that this Organization is, first and foremost, the supreme body at the service of mankind. Beyond the diversities of tradition and culture, man is in effect the subject of rights and freedoms, who through dignity attains a universal value. The mission of the United Nations thus becomes universal only to the extent to which the Organization proves capable of promoting and protecting these rights and freedoms.\n"

        "file_text": "\n49.\t Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure and honor to extend to you, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office exemplifies the international community's confidence in your country's leading and constructive role in international forums, particularly the United Nations. It is also an expression of confidence in your ability and wisdom to carry out the important tasks entrusted to this session. The close and intimate relationship that we have with fraternal Iraq makes us share the same sentiments of satisfaction in the confidence that has been shown in you.\n50.\tWe should like also to take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar, who presided over the previous session and subsequently the eighth emergency special session with a competence and objectivity that earned him the respect of us all.\n51.\tWe wish also to take this opportunity to reiterate our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his endeavors aimed at enhancing the role of the United Nations in the solution of problems confronting the contemporary world, the continued existence of which, without just and radical solution, will threaten the peace and security of mankind.\n52.\tThe delegation of the United Arab Emirates has the pleasure of welcoming Vanuatu and Belize to the United Nations. In expressing our sincerest congratulations on their independence and admission to membership in the United Nations, we look forward to the realization of the universality of the Organization, when all territories under colonial rule and foreign occupation will be liberated and admitted to the United Nations.\n53.\tThe international situation, on both the political and economic levels, has steadily worsened since the last session. The Secretary-General referred to this situation in his annual report on the work of the Organization by stating that EastWest relations have once again become severely strained as a result of the abandonment of the policies of detente [see A/36/J, sect. 7]. This has been aggravated by emphasis on the arms race; by consideration of military superiority as the main factor in relations among the great Powers; by the use of arms in certain areas or the threat of the use of arms in others, in violation of the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of States as well as of the right to self-determination, particularly on the part of certain great Powers; and by non-respect for human rights and basic values.\n54.\tWe observe with great concern the interference, direct or indirect, by certain great Powers in the internal affairs of other countries and even military aggression against them. This interference represents a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international conventions and treaties which embody the principle of noninterference and the right of every State to choose the form of government it desires. We therefore deplore and denounce such interference in all its forms. The consequences of this interference are not borne by the victimized countries alone but affect us all, and in particular the countries of the third world. An example of this reality has been the escalation of the military presence of the great Powers in our region and in the region of the Indian Ocean.\n55.\tBecause of its Arab commitments and its status as a member of the nonaligned movement, the United Arab Emirates firmly believes that the security of the Gulf is the sole responsibility of the countries of the Gulf. Consequently, it refuses to join any military alliances. It also rejects the interference by any foreign country in its internal affairs, including the imposition of any form of protection over its territory. My country also considers the creation of any foreign force entrusted with the so-called protection of the Gulf's security as a violation of the sovereignty of the region's States and a threat to their integrity and stability.\n56.\tThe political will of the Arab States of the Gulf has resulted in the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The creation of this Council is an expression of the aspirations of the peoples and Governments of the area and their determination to create a viable framework designed to promote coordination, cooperation and integration among member States in all fields. The Council will enable its members to deepen and strengthen ties as well as unify their economic, social, informational and administrative systems. The establishment of the Council conforms to the Charter of the United Nations, which encourages coordination and cooperation among States of the same region.\n57.\tAs regards the Indian Ocean, which involves us, my country has supported and will continue to support the General Assembly resolution on the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. In this context, we regret the position adopted by certain States and in particular by the major Powers, which has led to the postponement of the conference which was scheduled to meet at Colombo in 1981 for the purpose of prescribing the necessary measures for the implementation of that Declaration.\n58.\tThe ongoing war between Iraq and Iran is to us a source of grief and sorrow. This war has lasted too long and has resulted in enormous human and material loss. Its continuation is not in the interest of either party. It must stop, not only to save lives and restore peace and security in the area, but also to exclude any external interference by the great Powers and others. Iraq's response to initiatives for peace has earned the admiration of the international community. We urge the continuation of the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the nonaligned movement for a ceasefire and the elimination of the causes that triggered the war.\n59.\tDeterioration in the policy of detente has led to a similar deterioration in disarmament negotiations and in attempts to end the arms race. In 1980, armaments cost almost $500 billion, that is, 6 per cent on the world's gross national product. In addition to that, the stockpiling of more and improved weapons has continued, specifically in the realm of nuclear, bacteriological and neutron weapons.\n60.\tIn view of this explosive situation, we express our concern over the escalation of the arms race, which endangers international peace and security and leads to the great squandering of resources that could have been devoted to the service of mankind if employed for the purpose of economic and social development,\n61.\tWe also appeal to the big Powers to put an end to the deterioration in detente and not to think of security only in military terms. Otherwise, the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament will be doomed to failure.\n62.\tRecent developments in South Africa and Namibia arouse our gravest concern. The minority regime is still striving to maintain its domination over the indigenous African people and to undermine their dignity by denying them the exercise of their political rights, including the right to self-determination. The racist regime in South Africa persists in the practice of the policy of apartheid and in the establishment of Bantustans in defiance of the United Nations and world public opinion, both of which have condemned that policy as a violation of human rights and values and of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n63.\tIn Namibia, the racist regime of Pretoria persists in its defiance of the United Nations by rejecting its resolutions, consolidating its own racist colonialist regime and preventing the attainment of independence by this Territory and the exercise by its people of its right to self determination under the leadership of SWAPO, its sole legitimate representative. The support rendered by certain Western countries to South Africa is the main factor that has encouraged the Pretoria regime in undertaking its aggressive colonialist policies.\n64.\tConsequently, last April the Security Council considered the Namibian question and the obstructionist role of the racist regime in order to determine what steps should be taken with regard to this. Regrettably, three great States, permanent members of the Council, vetoed the four draft resolutions submitted to the Council. It was therefore necessary to convene an emergency special session of the General Assembly, in accordance with resolution 377 (V), entitled \\\"Uniting for peace\\\". My country supported the convening of that session, participated in its debates and strongly supported the resolution adopted with regard to this question.\n65.\tWe strongly condemn the repeated acts of aggression committed by the racist regime of Pretoria against the front-line African States. We urge the Security Council to apply against that regime the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter.\n66.\tWe nurture the hope that the countries which support South Africa will learn the lessons of history and realize the inevitability of the emancipation of all peoples from the yoke of colonialism and racism, We also hope that those countries will abandon their current policies under which priority is given to their economic and strategic interests over human principles and ideals and the rule of international law.\n67.\tThis also applies with regard to Kampuchea, whose people have suffered for so long from foreign interference and aggression.\n68.\tWe believe that the time has come to settle the conflict between North Korea and South Korea through dialog, with a view to eliminating the causes of disagreement between them and satisfying the desire of their people to unite.\n69.\tWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General regarding the development of the current negotiations between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus, which have entered a more constructive stage. We express our hope for the success of the intense efforts being exerted to enable the current negotiations to culminate in an agreement providing for the security and coexistence of the people of the island and guaranteeing the territorial integrity and neutrality of the Republic of Cyprus.\n70.\tWe all expected that at the last session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea a convention would be concluded during 1981. However, such expectations were not fulfilled, owing to the reevaluation by the new United States Administration of some of the provisions of the draft convention, in particular those pertaining to the exploitation of the seabed.\n71.\tMy country, as a member of the Group of 77 developing countries, concurs with that Group's rejection of the American attitude and considers it an obstacle to what had been agreed to following lengthy negotiations among all participants, including the United States. In hoping for the removal of these obstacles, we insist on the conclusion of the convention no later than 1982. We see the conclusion of such an agreement as enhancing the role of the United Nations in finding practical solutions to the other major global problems.\n72.\tAt previous sessions of the General Assembly the United Arab Emirates has described in detail the principles and convictions upon which its policies regarding the Middle East problem and the question of Palestine are based. The most important of these principles are the following: first, recognition that the question of Palestine constitutes the crux and essence of the Middle East problem and that consequently the ArabIsraeli conflict cannot be resolved without the simultaneous resolution of the Palestinian problem; secondly, complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, including Al Quds Al Sharif; thirdly, the exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable rights, including the right of return, the right to self-determination without external interference, the right to national independence and complete sovereignty and the right to establish its independent and sovereign State in Palestine; and, fourthly, participation by the PLO, the sole representative of the people of Palestine, on an equal footing in any attempts or efforts made and any conference held to settle this problem.\n73.\tWe consider that the principles enunciated by Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia constitute the basis for a just and comprehensive solution to the ArabIsraeli conflict. We welcome and support his statement as a constructive step towards the return of stability and security to the Middle East region.\n74.\tThe period since the last session has been characterized by Israel's persistence in its aggressive policies and its violations of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rule of international law, thus defying the world community and the international consensus.\n75.\tIsrael continues to pursue its policy of Judaization of the Holy City of Jerusalem and the eradication of its Arab and Islamic character. It also continues to carry out excavations that threaten the survival of the holy Al Aqsa mosque, which has a unique significance for Moslems throughout the world. In reiterating our absolute condemnation and rejection of these aggressive Israeli measures, we reaffirm our adherence to the resolutions adopted by the Organization of the Islamic Conference with respect to Jerusalem and welcome the resolutions of the United Nations which firmly reject the annexation by Israel of Jerusalem and the transformation of it into the capital of Israel.\n76.\tIn the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories, the Israeli authorities continue to confiscate Arab lands and to establish settlements aimed at the imposition of a fait accompli, the obstruction of the return of those lands and the denial to the Palestinian people of the exercise of the right to self-determination and the establishment of its independent State. It is time for the United Nations, and in particular the Security Council, to impose sanctions on Israel for its policies, which contravene many of its resolutions as well as international rules and conventions.\n77.\tIsrael has not confined its colonial practices to that phase but has engaged in other types of infringement such as expulsion of certain Palestinian leaders, including elected mayors, restriction of the civil rights of numerous leaders and even attempts to assassinate some of them, interference in educational affairs, imprisonment, demolition of houses, deportation of inhabitants to other areas and other methods of repression, oppression and terrorism.\n78.\tWhile condemning those measures, we believe that it is incumbent on the international community to put an end to them once and for all.\n79.\tIn Lebanon, Israel has recently escalated its ferocious and barbaric attacks against civilian installations and Palestinian refugee camps. Israel even went so far as to bomb civilian quarters in Beirut, killing and injuring hundreds of civilians and completely destroying numerous buildings, bridges and other installations. The report of each of the two fact-finding committees appointed by the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the non aligned movement are graphic evidence of this.\n80. Israel did not confine its aggression to neighboring areas but extended it to attacking Iraq. Violating the airspace of three Arab countries, Israel then bombed and destroyed Iraq's nuclear installations employed for peaceful purposes. The world condemned and deplored those two acts of aggression. We had hoped that the Security Council would go beyond condemnation and the demand for restitution to the application of Chapter VII of the Charter against that aggressive State.\n81.\tIn this connection, we appeal to the States which support Israel, in particular the United States, to abandon their partisan policies by giving priority to the principles and purposes of the Charter. We expect them to participate in a concerted effort for this noble cause, which entails deterring the aggressor, terminating defiance of the United Nations and its resolutions, safeguarding the Organization and its prestige and exerting pressure on Israel to comply with United Nations resolutions.\n82.\tIt is indeed regrettable that the Government of the United States recently announced a strategic alliance with Israel. That alliance, in our opinion, constitutes encouragement to Israel to persist in its aggressive and expansionist policies and its defiance of the international will.\n83.\tThe world economy has been experiencing a progressive deterioration. The damaging outcome of that deterioration has affected the economies of all States in the world, but the damage done to the developing countries has been greater, and this has resulted in an additional burden on their endeavors for development. The continued manifestation of that deterioration is attributed to the deficiencies that still characterize the bases governing the world economic system. Those bases were established under conditions of absolute domination by the capitalist countries. Such a situation no longer exists, because of the drastic developments witnessed by the world in the past 30 years. Hence, there has been a need to introduce fundamental changes in the system to allow it to adjust to the new circumstances.\n84.\tThat need has been expressed with increasing clarity through a series of important resolutions adopted by the General Assembly since its sixth special session, The most vital have been the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (SVI)} and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. Those resolutions contain firm bases on which a just economic system could be built. The international community has been unable to implement those resolutions because of the position of some industrial nations which consider that the developing nations could participate in international decision-making on a basis of equality only at the expense of the industrial nations' absolute control of the world economic system, and that failure has led to feelings of frustration and disappointment. As a result, world efforts have suffered a great setback. Those efforts were oriented towards establishing and implementing general guidelines for economic reform, but they have failed to bear fruit because some countries have not respected their declared commitments.\n85.\tWe express our increasing concern over the suspension of those negotiations, and we share the confidence of the world community that their resumption and success will establish important components for the foundations of a viable economic system that will enable the international community to surmount its crises. We hope that the Cancun meeting will pave the way for the resumption of those negotiations.\n86.\tThe experience of past years has demonstrated that certain regional methods, far from alleviating the impact of world problems, have created new problems. The conclusion to be drawn from that experience is that economic issues, though they may be regional in origin, have global effects. Hence the global character and the comprehensiveness of the impact of economic questions require collective participation by all in the effort to change the structure of the remedies currently advocated.\n87.\tIn this respect, it is important to affirm that the final objective of establishing new international economic relations based on fairness and mutual respect is in the interest of mankind, since the health and prosperity of the industrial economies are to a great extent linked to the development of the developing world. The demands for change thus acquire a global and comprehensive dimension.\n88.\tSome sectors of the world economy require urgent global action. Thus, inflation, monetary instability, protectionism and other problems have paralyzed the world economy.\n89.\tDespite the fact that inflation is a phenomenon originating in the industrial countries, its negative effects have reached the developing nations and created new difficulties for their development. This calls for urgent international action that would curtail the impact of this phenomenon.\n90.\tThe world economy also suffers from an unstable monetary system as a result of drastic fluctuations in the rates of exchange of major currencies. Those fluctuations have had damaging effects on the economies of many countries, in particular those of the developing countries whose export earnings have diminished. The world has the responsibility of reducing the impact of those fluctuations. A major step in that direction lies in the establishment of international supervision over the exchange rate of key currencies, as well as in the diminution of the dominant role of some of those currencies. Such measures would constitute an enormous step forward toward the establishment of a new world monetary system.\n91.\tIn addition to this, world trade has recently witnessed an increase in the protectionist measures practiced by developed countries. Those measures impose new restrictions on the movement of international commerce and have victimized the developing countries by reducing their income from foreign trade, which renders them unable to rectify the deficits in their balances of payments. That leads to a great decline in international trade, thereby contributing to the continuing deterioration of the world economy.\n92.\tAs an oil-producing country, and aware of its role in world economic relations, the United Arab Emirates has made a great contribution to the improvement of the international economic situation. Our policies on the production and pricing of crude oil and our program of development aid clearly demonstrate our great concern for the integrity of the world economy. Those policies also signify our sincere desire for the alleviation of the world economic crises, even at the cost of diminishing our oil reserves.\n93.\tIn the field of international cooperation, my country has adopted ambitious aid programs which vastly surpass the percentages of gross national product prescribed in the new International Development Strategy. Through such programs, our revenues have been transferred to the developing nations in the form of grants and soft loans, as an expression of solidarity with the developing countries. That aid has been granted despite the fact that my country is itself a developing country, newly independent, and needs much of its resources to establish its economic and social institutions.\n"

        "file_text": "97.\t I join preceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Kittani most warmly on his election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His accession to that high post obviously bears witness not only to his eminent qualities as a skilled statesman and diplomat but to his breadth of knowledge and wide experience of the Organization. We are convinced that under his guidance and thanks to his wisdom our work will be concluded successfully. In this respect, may I at once assure him of my delegation's complete cooperation.\n98.\tI also wish to reiterate our deep appreciation bf the devotion, intelligence and tact with which his predecessor; the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, discharged his noble task.\n99.\tIt is a pleasure for us to emphasize the appreciation of the Government of Chad for the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral to uphold the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations and, above all, for his concern about the situation in Chad.\n100.\tFinally, we congratulate Vanuatu and Belize on their accession to independence and welcome them to the great family of the United Nations.\n101.\tOnce again we are gathered here to review the positions of our Governments, assess the behavior of some and point up the contradictions indeed, the humiliations suffered by others. The situation prevailing in Chad is proof of this. That is why we crave the indulgence of representatives as we undertake first a brief summary of that situation since the victory of the governmental forces over the enemy on 15 December 1980.\n102.\tThe people of Chad, like all other peoples of the world, jealously guards its independence and national sovereignty and denies any one the right to impose a code of conduct on it. As is only proper, Chad respects the sacrosanct principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and that of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], such as respect for territorial integrity, the free choice of a socioeconomic regime, noninterference in the internal affairs of other States and the self-determination of peoples.\n103.\tIt is fitting to recall that the painful war into which Chad was plunged stemmed from a situation created by foreign Powers. Our economic development, which was still only in its embryonic stage and largely jeopardized by drought, is at a standstill. All administrative, economic and social structures are dislocated, if they exist at all. The entire country has to be rebuilt.\n104.\tAt the tragic moment when the very foundations of the nation and its unity were threatened, the international community did not remain indifferent; it responded promptly to the appeals made by our delegations at the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth sessions of the General Assembly by adopting, respectively, resolutions 34/120 and 35/92.\n105.\tBy its resolution 34/120 the General Assembly appealed urgently to all Member States, specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system and international economic and financial institutions to provide generous emergency aid to Chad through bilateral or multilateral channels, with a view to meeting its short term and longterm needs with respect to reconstruction, rehabilitation and development.\n106.\tIn that connection, the SecretaryGeneral was requested to dispatch a mission to Chad to review with the Government the aid which it needs for its reconstruction and the question of organizing a meeting of donors and to coordinate his efforts with those of UNDP, ECA and the World Bank. But the abortive coup d'etat of 21 March 1980, which degenerated into a civil war, made it impossible for such a mission to be sent. Thus resolution 34/120 remained a dead letter.\n107.\tDuring the thirty-fifth session that is to say, during the height of the N'Djamena war the General Assembly in its resolution 35/92 A renewed its appeal for assistance in Chad's reconstruction. Since there could be no response to such an appeal in the absence of peace, the Assembly adopted a second text resolution 35/92 B aimed at extending emergency assistance to people affected by the war.\n108.\tThe Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, for its part, at its eighteenth session, at Nairobi, adopted resolution AHG/ Res. 102 (XVIII) Rev. 1 [see AI361534, annex //], in which it appealed to all members of the OAU, to the United Nations and to other international organizations to come to the aid of the Government and people of Chad. In that regard, it called upon the SecretaryGeneral of the OAU to organize as soon as possible, and in cooperation with the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, a pledging conference to assist Chad to finance its reconstruction plan.\n109.\tThe adoption of these various resolutions gave the people of Chad cause for great hope and was a source of satisfaction and relief.\n110.\tIn implementation of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, the SecretaryGeneral dispatched two missions to Chad, in January and March of 1981, to estimate the emergency aid required by the people of Chad. furthermore, an agreement was signed between Chad and UNDP for the reconstruction of the N'Djamena airport by that agency.\n111.\tSimilarly, such organizations as ICAO, WHO, UNICEF, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the European Development Fund made considerable means available to us.\n112.\tThanks to those combined efforts famine and epidemics have been avoided; displaced persons and refugees have found shelter from the elements; and distribution systems of drinking water and electricity and N'Djamena airport and other means of communication are being rebuilt.\n113.\tCertain friendly countries did not wait for the appeals of the United Nations and the OAU to come to our aid. We refer particularly to the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which granted us substantial material and financial aid for the national reconstruction of Chad. Similarly, the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, the People's Republic of the Congo, the Gabonese Republic and the Federal Republic of Nigeria unswervingly have demonstrated their active solidarity with the people of Chad. We wish to express our profound gratitude to those brother countries.\n114.\tFrance, since the socialist Government came to power, has expressed its willingness to resume cooperation with Chad. Thus President Goukouni Weddeye made a friendly visit to Paris from 16 to 18 September 1981. We venture to hope that the missions which the Government of France has sent to Chad to evaluate our needs for reconstruction will soon lead to practical steps in our country.\n115.\tWe also hope that the other members of the international community will not fail to contribute to the recovery of Chad by giving practical assistance in the political, diplomatic and financial fields.\n116.\tThe Government of Chad tirelessly strives to maintain and strengthen national unity and stability. In this connection, the head of State has signed a decree granting a general amnesty to those persons who have been detained, condemned or exiled for political reasons. Within the framework of this general amnesty the citizens of Chad who left the areas of combat are returning by the thousands to their country, thanks to the dynamic action of UNHCR and the valuable assistance of neighboring countries, in particular Nigeria, the United Republic of Cameroon and the Central African Republic. We wish to reiterate our profound gratitude for their generous sacrifices on behalf of the people of Chad.\n117.\tFurthermore, in order to give a general orientation to the actions to be undertaken in regard to the situation prevailing in the country, the Government made public on 25 August 1981 a declaration of general policy. In this declaration the Transitional National Union Government committed itself to an international policy of nonalignment and support for the struggles of all peoples against imperialism, neocolonialism, apartheid, Zionism and all forms of domination and segregation.\n118.\tIn its relations with neighboring and other countries Chad is committed to respect for the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the charter of the OAU and the principles of the nonaligned movement. Its territory will never be used as a base for subversive actions against neighboring countries, friends and brothers, and it will never permit the establishment of a foreign base on its territory.\n119.\tChad will cooperate fully with them on the basis of respect for mutual interests and common understanding, national independence and territorial integrity, while taking into account historical, geographical and cultural factors.\n120.\tSince December 1980 a great deal has been said regarding the Libyan military presence in Chad. We should like the international community to know that this military presence is possible only because we asked for it, to help us in frustrating a plot aimed at the annihilation of Chad. The plot was organized and maintained by States members of our organization, and I shall return to this later. In this respect we wish to reiterate from this rostrum our gratitude to our brother people of Libya for this courageous act of solidarity.\n121.\tWe are always ready to welcome the panAfrican force for the maintenance of peace. It was in this sense that the Transitional National Union Government, in its declaration of general policy, committed itself to the establishment, in cooperation with the authorities of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, of a timetable for the gradual withdrawal of the troops stationed in Chad. But this has not yet been completed because of the maneuvers and acts of destabilization of our neighboring and brother country, the Sudan, which gives shelter to Chad dissidents, although this is contrary to the relevant decisions of the OAU. It should also be said that the Libyan authorities have themselves indicated their desire to withdraw from Chad, but the Government of Chad asked them to stay because of the external threats.\n122.\tAs the head of State declared at his press conference in Paris on 18 September 1981, \\\"As long as the Sudan continues to threaten Chad by acts of destabilization, and until we establish our integrated national army, the Libyan troops will remain on our territory.\\\"\n123.\tThe Sudan is fighting Chad on the false pretext that the Libyan troops on our territory represent a danger to its security. Why are not Chad and other neighbors of the Sudan concerned about the presence of more than 40,000 Egyptian soldiers on Sudanese territory? We feel that this is a matter that concerns the two countries, namely, Egypt and the Sudan. Therefore the Government of the Sudan has no reason to be unduly concerned about the presence of the Libyan military contingent in Chad. Why does the Government of the Sudan welcome Chad outlaws and finance, arm and train them, with the obvious assistance of certain Powers? Did not President Nimeiri declare at the end of the N'Djamena hostilities that the war had not come to an end in Chad?\n124.\tThe threats of aggression against Chad have increased since March 1981. The Government of Chad has made those facts known to the President of the Security Council. These warlike actions have become so intemperate that the Government of Chad felt bound to report the fact once again to the President of the Security Council on 21 September.5 It was to improve this unfriendly attitude that the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity called on Chad's neighboring States not to give refuge to movements that oppose the Government of Chad. Furthermore, the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, President Daniel Arap Moi, has redoubled the efforts by sending messages and special emissaries to the Government of the Sudan to ask it to stop its interference in the internal affairs of Chad.\n125.\tHowever, all these measures have been in vain. Since 5 September 1981 acts of brigandage on the Chad Sudanese frontier have become open aggression by Sudanese regular soldiers against the Government forces of Chad.\n126.\tNo country, however weakened, can tolerate such scorn for its sovereignty. From this rostrum we solemnly appeal to the Government of the Sudan to halt its aggression, which is contrary to the interests of both our peoples. But if it persists in such a course despite the defeat suffered by its forces on the eastern frontier of Chad, it will always and everywhere encounter the same determination of the people of Chad to defend itself by all possible means. We call on the Sudanese leaders to remember the cost of the many years of internal war that they have known, which never brought happiness to the people of Sudan.\n127.\tWhile apologizing for having described at such length the situation of our country, I wish to express our sincere desire to live in peace with all our neighbors, including the Sudan, provided it ceases its acts of aggression against our people, who aspire only to peace and social and economic well-being after so many years of tribulation.\n128.\tI should like to refer briefly to the main items on the agenda for this session which are of special interest to the delegation of Chad, namely, decolonization, maintenance of peace and security, and international economic cooperation.\n129.\tWith regard to decolonization, the obstinate refusal of certain regimes to apply General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples clearly shows the contradiction between the glorification of human rights and their daily violation, particularly in southern Africa, Western Sahara and other parts of the world.\n130.\tThe situation in Namibia is a matter of grave and constant concern for my Government. Thus, my delegation condemns the arrogant and anachronistic attitude of the South African regime which, in order to consolidate its illegal presence in Namibia, creates an atmosphere of intimidation and terror through the inhuman system of apartheid.\n131.\tSuch an attitude leaves the South West Africa People's Organization [SMPO] no other choice than armed struggle the only one, in truth, capable of bringing the Pretoria regime to reason, in spite of its support from Western Powers, and to force it to capitulate, as did its emulators in Salisbury.\n132.\tChad, for its part, will continue to denounce any fraudulent constitutional or political maneuvers whereby South Africa attempts to perpetuate its system of colonial aggression and exploitation of the population and resources of Namibia. We reaffirm our total opposition to the odious system of apartheid that exists in South Africa, which is a real challenge to all mankind.\n133.\tChad energetically condemns the recent invasion of Angola by the racist hordes of Pretoria. With the same firmness, we condemn the cowardly acts of aggression of the South African air force against fraternal front-line States.\n134.\tWe could not leave the subject of the African continent without recalling the situation in Western Sahara. That conflict is also of great concern to my Government. Faced with this tragedy, Chad has consistently called for a peaceful solution based on respect for the principle of self-determination in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the OAU and of the United Nations.\n135.\tIn this connection, my country has fully subscribed to resolution AHG/Res.103 (XVIII) on Western Sahara, adopted at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity at Nairobi [ibid.]. We thus entrust to the Implementation Committee created by this resolution the organization of a referendum on this question so that the Sahraoui people may finally enjoy their legitimate rights.\n136.\tSince it is unanimously recognized today that no solution to the Middle East can be found without a just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question, a refusal to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization is tantamount to rejecting peace. Experience has shown that all attempts at partial settlements have not produced the desired results.\n137.\tAs far as we are concerned, we have always affirmed in the OAU, in the nonaligned movement and in the United Nations that the Palestinian people, like any other people, have the right to their homeland and that their inalienable rights must be preserved. Consequently we once again condemn the decision of Israel to make Jerusalem its capital. For its part, my country will continue its efforts to ensure the restoration to the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights, by all means possible, and the return of the other Arab territories occupied by Israel.\n138.\tWe likewise condemn the destruction of the nuclear installation at Tamuz in Iraq and the bombings of civilian targets in Lebanon by Israel.\n139.\tOther major problems now face the international community, and Chad trusts that peaceful solutions will rapidly be found in the higher interest of all concerned. The conflict that still threatens the stability of the sister republics of Iran and Iraq, despite the many attempts at mediation, remains a matter of constant concern to our delegation. We most ardently hope that in the near future a peaceful solution will be found to the tragedy that has befallen the peoples of both countries.\n140.\tThe peoples of the third world face not only the odious practices of apartheid and racism, as is the case in southern Africa, but also new attacks on their independence and territorial integrity. All this is a threat to their right to freedom and dignity.\n141.\tGeneral and complete disarmament is one of the objectives that has been proclaimed by the United Nations for nearly three decades. However, despite the many initiatives taken by the Organization in this field, the world is witnessing instead an unbridled race for supremacy in destructive power. This is why Chad welcomes the idea of a new special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Such a session, we venture to hope, would enable all Member States to contribute to the establishment of a strategy for true general disarmament.\n142.\tWe have talked of peace, and now we should like to touch briefly on problems of development, for as a voice of high moral authority, the late Pope Paul VI, stated development is the new name for peace. This means that one cannot speak of peace so long as hundreds of millions of human beings live in abject poverty while a handful of the rich live in opulence and engage in a reckless race to acquire the most destructive weapons that mankind has ever known.\n143.\tAnd yet, for 36 years the world Organization, whose Charter devotes some of its provisions to the problems of development, has been dealing with the fate of the poor countries. Unfortunately, as you will no doubt agree, the political will of the rich countries has not been in accord with the declarations of the United Nations. The failure of two successive decades devoted to development is due to this lack of political will.\n144.\tIn such circumstances, will the United Nations continue to adopt resolutions that will never achieve even the semblance of implementation? My delegation believes that the time has come to leave the world of ideas and enter the world of action. This means that there must be unreserved readiness on the part of our partners and full acceptance of the solidarity that should prevail among members of the same family; such active solidarity was demonstrated by the United States with respect to Western Europe after the Second World War and took the form of the Marshall Plan. And yet, the problems we face today in the developing countries far exceed in scope those experienced by Europe, which, it should be remembered, despite the destruction it suffered had the technology.\n145.\tWhy then is there one law for the rich and another for the poor? Development problems are familiar to everyone, and we believe that all the measures advocated by the third world over the past two decades for their solution are reasonable. But the NorthSouth dialog is held up because certain Powers take unilateral positions and give negative answers when it comes to reconciling differing views in order to achieve positive results. Our delegation hopes that the meeting of 22 heads of State and Government to be held at Cancun in a few days will provide an opportunity for those Powers to give proof of their good will to the third world by permitting, inter alia, the reopening of the global negotiations in the United Nations.\n146.\tWhether it is a question of commodities, the transfer of technology, monetary problems, financial aid, new and renewable sources of energy, the least developed countries or cooperation among developing countries, my country supports the efforts the United Nations has made for many years in these various sectors to bring about a new, just and equitable international economic order.\n147.\tBecause of the situation prevailing in my country, we have taken up some of the Assembly's time to set forth the major concerns of our people. Our people have suffered so much from war that they now long for a lasting peace so that they can devote themselves to their development with the assistance of friendly countries and of the international community. We wish to state how much our delegation appreciates the words of sympathy for my country uttered by many of the previous speakers.\n148.\tIf we have reluctantly been forced to bring up the matter of a neighboring and brother country, it has not been out of any desire for sterile polemics. We would simply draw the attention of the General Assembly to that situation, which is likely to disturb the peace and security of our subregion. We hope that our appeal will be heeded in the true interests of our respective peoples.\n149.\tBefore concluding, we should like once again to appeal to the international community to come to our aid, to the greatest possible extent, in the true battle we intend to wage in future, the battle for the reconstruction and development of Chad.\n"
